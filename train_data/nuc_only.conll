the	0
hard	0

a	0
a	0
actor	1
that's	0
uh	0
like	1
th[e]	0
oh	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	1
didn't	0
i	0
didn't	0
even	0
like	0
the	0
previews	1
on	0
that	0

oh	0
i	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
well	1
i	0
ended	0
up	0
at	0
the	0
theater	1
and	1
there	0
was	0
didn't	0
seem	0
to	0
be	0
anything	1
else	0
on	0
i	0
wanted	1
to	1
see	0
so	0
i'll	0
try	0
that	0

but	0
it	0
wasn't	0
worth	0
anything	0
i	0
didn't	0
care	1
for	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

no	0

i	1
don't	0
i	0
don't	0

for	0
michael	0
j	0
fox	0

three	0
deals	1
and	0
that	0
was	0
crummy	0

i	0
didn't	0
think	0
that	0
was	0
any	0
good	1
so	0

yeah	0

so	0

i	0
saw	1
the	0
original	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
future	0
and	0
then	0
i	0
i	0
know	0
i	0
hardly	0
ever	0
go	0
see	0
a	0
sequel	1

yeah	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	0
the	0
only	0
i've	0
ever	0
seen	0
a	0
sequel	1
was	0
two	0
thousand	0
and	0
one	1

uh	0
two	0
thousand	0
and	0
ten	0
was	0
far	0
better	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

two	0
thousand	0
and	0
one	0
was	0
a	0
good	0
movie	1
if	0
you	0
had	0
read	0
the	0
book	1

well	0
i	0
hadn't	0
read	1
it	0
and	0
i	0
couldn't	0
figure	0
what	0
was	0
going	0
on	1
half	1
the	0
time	0
so	0

yeah	0
no	0
nobody	0
could	0
figure	0
it	0
out	1
i	0
mean	0
the	0
the	0
book	0
was	0
so	0
much	0
uh	0

yeah	0

there's	0
just	0
things	0
all	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
is	0
put	0
it	0
in	0
words	1
you	0
can't	0
put	0
it	0
in	0
pictures	1

yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
that	0
stuff	1
that	0
was	0
going	0
on	0
in	0
the	0
film	1
you	0
c[ould]	0
say	0
what	0
is	0

you	0
know	0
what's	0
the	0
significance	0
of	0
the	0
apes	0

that	1
i	0
just	0
saw	0
the	0
movie	0

too	0
long	1
ago	0

oh	0

book	0
is	0
really	0
good	0
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	0
keep	0
a	0
little	0
library	0
of	0
books	1
that	0
i	0
just	0
like	0
to	0
read	1
over	0
and	0
over	1
again	0
and	0
that's	0
one	0
of	1
them	0
it's	0

wow	0
huh	0

it's	0
so	0
well	0
written	0

huh	1
huh	0

scenes	0
you've	0
ever	0
seen	0
in	0
your	0
life	1
and	0
it's	0
all	1
this	0
it's	0
the	0
story	0
of	0
this	0
little	0
cat	0
and	0
dog	1
and	0
it's	0
not	0
like	0
cutesy	0

just	1
uh	0
it's	0
just	0
so	1
realistic	1
everything	1

got	0
them	0
to	0
do	1
some	0
of	0
these	0

really	0
nice	0
place	0
you	0

yeah	0

uh	0
that	0
that	0
was	0
interesting	0

quite	0
a	0
lot	1
and	0
see	0
shows	0
down	0

a	0
lot	0
of	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
did	0
but	0

yeah	0

but	0
it	0
would	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
show	1

it's	0
hard	0
to	0
know	1
what	0
the	0
good	0
movies	0
are	1
anymore	0
because	0

yeah	0

because	0
sometimes	0
the	0
reviews	1
you	0
just	0
can't	0
go	1
by	0
and	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	0

they	0
they	0
they	0
have	0
all	0
these	0
neat	0
phrases	1
you	0

the	0
like	0
critically	0

yeah	0

that's	0
what	0
they	0
say	1
when	0

won	0
any	0
award	1

oh	0
i	0
see	0

you	0
know	0
they	0
can't	0

it's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	0
waterfront	0
property	1
or	0
something	1
if	0
you're	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
you're	0
two	0
miles	0
away	1
from	0

from	0
love	0
canal	0

waterfront	0
property	0
here	0
at	0
love	0
canal	0
you	0

yeah	0

but	0
you	0
know	0
critically	0
acclaimed	0
oh	0
good	0
grief	0
give	0
me	0
a	0
break	0

that's	0
wh[at]	0
i	0
mean	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
reasons	1
why	1
i	0
don't	0
go	0
to	0
movies	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
primarily	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
now	0
i'm	0
probably	1
going	0
to	0
going	0
to	0
upset	1
you	0
but	0
people	0
who	0
bring	0
kids	1
irritates	1
the	0
heck	1
out	0
of	0
me	0

uh	0
well	0
what	0
would	1
you	1
say	0
your	0
opinion	0
is	0
on	0
gun	0
control	1

well	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i've	1
i've	1
had	0
mixed	0
emotions	1
i	0
guess	0
when	0
i	0
listen	1
to	0
uh	1
the	0
radio	1
and	0
and	0
watch	0
tv	1
about	0
the	0
different	1
uh	0
things	0
that	0
are	0
happening	1
i	0
uh	0
i'm	0
against	1
it	0
but	0
on	0
the	0
same	1
token	1
um	0
i	0
went	0
out	0
and	0
purchased	0
a	0
gun	1
just	1
because	1
i	1
wanted	0
the	0
right	0
to	0
do	1
that	0

well	1

so	0
i	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
rifle	0
in	0
the	0
house	1
um	0
the	0
ammunition	1
is	0
probably	0
so	0
old	1
i'm	0
afraid	0
to	0
use	1
it	0
but	1
uh	0
i	0
bought	1
it	0
for	0
target	0
practicing	1
and	0
uh	1
and	0
also	1
because	0
i	0
wanted	0
a	0
weapon	1
uh	0
how	0
do	0
you	1
feel	0
about	0
it	0

well	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
down	0
here	0
in	1
texas	1
they	0
don't	0
have	0
a	0
waiting	0
period	0
on	1
handguns	1

hm	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
need	0
that	1
uh	0
now	0
i	0
do	1
have	0
a	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
pistol	1
it's	0
a	0
little	0
twenty	0
two	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
twenty	0
two	1
or	0
a	0
twelve	0
gauge	0
shotgun	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
do	1
like	0
to	0
have	0
my	0
guns	1

uh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i'll	0
ever	0
use	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
and	0
like	0
you	1
my	0
bullets	1
to	0
my	0
little	0
pistol's	1
probably	1
uh	0
about	0
three	1
years	0
old	0
uh	0
my	0
gun	0
hasn't	0
been	0
shot	1
in	0
a	0
year	0
or	0
two	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
like	0
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
where	0
handy	0

well	0
up	1
uh	0
up	0
in	0
new	0
england	0
where	0
i'm	1
from	0
uh	0
y[ou]	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
permit	1
before	0
you	0
could	0
buy	0
any	1
ammu[n]it[ion]	1
amm[unition]	0
ammunition	1
and	0
i	0
thought	0
that	0
was	0
really	0
good	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
they	0
uh	0
takes	1

takes	1
two	0
weeks	1
for	0
that	0
system	1
to	0
process	1
um	0
your	0
request	1
for	1
uh	0
not	1
as	0
a	0
gun	0
permit	1
but	0
uh	0
but	0
to	0
buy	0
ammunition	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
get	0
a	0
p[ermit]	0
permit	1
from	0
the	0
police	0
station	1
in	0
your	0
local	1
area	0
to	0
do	1
that	0

i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0
anything	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0
um	0

that	0
would	0
be	0
nice	0
but	0
a[nd]	0
you	0
know	0

the	0
criminals	0
that	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
get	0
their	0
guns	1
one	0
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1

i	0
i	0
i	0
agree	0
i	0

i	0
think	1
you	0
know	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
that	0
that	0
needs	0
to	0
happen	1
is	0
uh	0
to	1
to	0
stop	0
the	0
impulse	0
buyer	1
from	0
um	0
buying	0
it	0
quickly	1
and	0
and	1
um	0
maybe	0
putting	0
a	0
week's	0
waiting	1
period	0
or	0
something	0
on	0
it	0
but	0

but	0
if	0
someone's	1
really	0
determined	1
to	1
to	0
pick	0
up	0
a	0
firearm	1
uh	0
you	0
can	0
pick	0
it	0
up	0
anyplace	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
them	0
really	0
cheap	1

i	0
know	0
i	0
i	1
uh	0
th[e]	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
waiting	1
period	0
on	0
my	1
pistol	0
because_1	0
i	1
was	0
down	0
in	0
uh	0
tennessee	1
and	1
uh	0
they	0
had	0
a	0
waiting	1
period	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
we	0
bought	0
it	0
there	1
and	0

how	0
long	0
was	0
the	0
waiting	0
period	0
out	0
there	0

about_1	0
nine	0
days	0

ah	0
that	0
wasn't	0
too	0
too	0
bad	0

no	0
no	0

because	0
i[f]	0
if	0
you're	0
gonna	0
go	0
buy	0
something	1
um	0
of	0
of	0
that	1
nature	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you're	0
gonna	0
have	1
some	1
idea	0
as	0
to	0
what	0
you're	0
gonna	0
do	1
with	0
it	0
you're	0
not	1
gonna	0
react	0
that	0
quickly	1
in	0
other	1
words	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
[d]on't	1
have	0
a	0
need	1
to	0
go	0
buy	0
a	0
gun	1
to	0
go	0
shoot	1
it	0
the	0
next	0
day	1

yeah	0
somebody	1
want	0
do	1
th[at]	0
i	1
i	1
at	0
times	1
i	0
think	0
they	0
ought	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
waiting	1
period	0
on	0
all	1
firearms	0

yeah	0
i	0
do	0
too	1
uh	0
because	1
[laughter-it]	0
doesn't	0
make	0
any	0
difference	1
uh	0
uh	0
whether	0
it's	0
a	0
pistol	0
or	0
a	0
shotgun	1
i	0
suppose	1
they	0
both	0
do	0
the	0
same	0
kind	0
of	0
job	1

shotgun	1
hurts	0
worse	0
than	0
a	0
pistol	1
does	0

uh	0
yeah	0
i	0
suppose	0
i'd	0
never	0
got	0
shot	0
with	0
either	0
one	1
but	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
um	0
i	0
think	0
you	0
could	0
recover	1
from	0
a	0
pistol	1
but	0
not	0
from	0
a	0
[laughter-shotgun]	1

a	0
shotgun's	1
got	0
too	0
much	0
of	0
a	0
spread	1
or	0
at	0
least	0
ours	0
does	0
uh	0

yeah	0

uh	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
little	1
uh	0
thing	1
on	0
the	0
bo[ttom]	0
bottom	1
of	0
th[e]	0
on	0
top	1
of	0
the	0
barrel	0
where	0
you	1
a[s]	0
you	0
turn	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

you	0
can	0
make	0
it	0
either	0
tight	0
or	0
[laughter-as]	0
loose	0
as	0
loose	0
can	0
get	0

oh	0

and	0
the	0
spread	0
changes	0

uh	0
i've	1
got	0
a	0
a	0
manual	0
singled	0
shot	1
and	0
i	0
guess	0
it	0
doesn't	0
have	0
any	1
any	0
automatic	0
features	1
to	0
it	0
the	0
further	0
away	0
i	0
get	1
the	0
the	1
uh	0
wider	0
the	0
shot	1
gets	0
from	0
the	0
target	1

yeah	0

and	0
the	0
closer	0
that	0
i	0
get	0
the	0
tighter	0
that	0
it	0
gets	0
it's	0
got	0
a	0
hell	0
of	0
a	0
kick	1
to	0
it	0

yeah	0
my	0
husband	1
had	0
a	0
uh	0
a	0
police	1
gun	0
at	0
one	0
time	0
and	0
i	0
shot	0
that	0
thing	0
one	0
time	1
almost	0
knocked	0
me	0
down	0

it	0
was	0
just	0
a	0
little	0
i	0
don['t]	0
i	0
forget	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
three	0
fifty	0
seven	1
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0

do	0
you	0
belong	0
to	0
a	0

just	1
for	0
target	1
practice	0

no	0
kidding	0

i'd	0
love	0
to	0
get	0
used	0
to	0
that	0
shotgun	0
we	1
traded	0
his	0
pistol	1
for	0
that	0
shotgun	1

huh	0
well	0
the	0
the	1
um	0
uh	0
clubs	1
that	0
we've	0
got	0
around	0
here	1
are	0
kind	0
of	0
expensive	1
but	0
uh	0
it's	0
well	0
worth	0
it	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
down	1
and	0
shoot	0
up	0
against	0
a	0
sand	0
bag	1
and	0
so[me]	0
targets	1
and	0
have	1
uh	0
competition	1
um	0
i've	0
never	1
really	0
joined	1
a	0

because	0
i	0

because	0
i	0
haven't	0
got	0
the	0
desire	1
uh	0
there's	0
an	0
annual	0
membership	0
fee	1
uh	0
that's	0
that's	0
fairly	0
high	1
plus	0
there's	0
initi[ation]	1
initiation	1
fee	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
as	0
a	0
first	0
time	1
uh	0
uh	0
member	1

so	0
the	0
whole	0
process	1
can	0
cost	1
you	0
a	0
hundred	0
fifty	0
dollars	1
just	0
to	0
join	0
the	0
club	1
plus	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
ammunition	1
in	0
any	0
tournaments	1
that	0
you	0
would	1
join	1
in	0

yeah	0
well	0
that's	0
what	0
uh	0
my	0
husband	0
wh[en]	0
when	0
he	1
was	0
in	0
it	0
gun	1
club	0
when	0
they's	0
done	0
that	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
he	1
went	0
mostly	0
just	0
to	0
um	0
shoot	0
at	0
paper	0
targets	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
but	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
used	0
speed	1
and	0
accuracy	1
and	0
all	0
that	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
the	0
gun	0
clubs	1
serve	0
a	0
useful	0
purpose	1
in	0
fact	1
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
somehow	0
they	0
tie	1
the	0
legislation	1
into	0
not	0
only	0
when	0
you	0
buy	1
a	0
weapon	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
uh	0
show	0
that	0
you've	0
gone	0
to	0
school	1
or	0
gone	0
to	0
some	0
class	1
to	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
handle	1
that	0
weapon	0

that's	0
a	0
good	0
i've	1
never	0
thought	0
of	0
that	1

that's	0
a	0
good	0
point	1

and	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
it	0
even	1
a[fter]	0
after	0
you	0
wait	0
your	0
nine	0
days	1
if	0
you	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
hand[le]	1
it's	0
just	1
like	0
putting	1
someone	0
in	0
an	0
automobile	1
that	0
doesn't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
and	0
you	0
give	0
him	0
a	0
license	1
because	0
he	0
waited	1
nine	0
days	0

yeah	0
that	0
and	0
yeah	0

he	1
could	0
he	0
could	0
not	0
only	1
um	1
uh	0
shoot	0
himself	1
he	0
could	0
he	0
could	1
uh	0
mishandle	1
a	0
weapon	0
leave	0
it	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
let	0
a	0
child	1
get	0
at	0
it	0

and	0
well	0
we	1
uh	1
we	1
was	0
living	0
on	0
a	0
navy	0
base	0
down	0
in	0
memphis	1
and	0
uh	0
this	0
one	0
guy	0
decided	0
to	0
play	1
uh	0
lonesome	0
cowboy	1
or	0
something	1
and	0
he	0
was	0
twirling	1
his	0
gun	1
around	0
and	0
shot	1
himself	0
in	0
his	0
foot	1

wow	0
he	0
was	0
fortunate	0
he	0
[laughter-could]	1
[laughter-he]	0
[laughter-could]	0
[laughter-of]	0
[laughter-hit]	0
[laughter-something]	0
[laughter-else]	1

well	0
he	0
went	0
tumbling	0
down	0
the	0
steps	1
along	1
with	0
uh	0
shooting	0
his	0
foot	0
almost	0
off	1
he	0
broke	0
his	0
leg	1
and	0
a	0
collar	0
bone	1
and	0
couple	0
of	0
other	1
things	0
i'm	0
sure	0
being	0
mister	0
cowboy	1
i	0

wow	0

i	0
can't	1
remember	0
what	1
the	0
na[me]	0
term	1
was	0
going	0
around	0
it	0
was	0
about	0
four	1
to	0
five	1
years	0
ago	0

but	0
naw	1
th[e]	0
i	1
guess	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	1

about_1	0
uh	0
private	0
citizens	1
selling	1
uh	0
weapons	1
like	0
if	0
you	0
wanted	0
to	0
sell	1
your	0
pistol	0
to	0
me	1
huh	0
how	0
do	0
you	0
feel	0
about	0
that	1
do	0
you	0
believe	1
there	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
legislation	1
guiding	1
the	0
um	0
buyer	0
and	0
the	0
seller	1
and	0
or	0
do	0
you	0
believe	1
that	0
you	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
sell	0
your	0
system	1
uh	0
because	0
you	0
own	1
it	0

uh	1
that's	0
a	0
hard	1
one	0
because_1	0
we	0
did	1
that	0
but	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
there	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
some	0
rule	0
against	1
it	0
i'll	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
person	1
who	0
sells	0
the	0
gun	1
ought	1
to	0
protect	0
themself	1
because	0
if	0
that	0
gun's	0
registered	0
to	0
them	1
and	0
somebody	0
else	0
uses	0
that	0
gun	0
in	0
something	1
the	0
cops	0
are	0
gonna	0
come	0
to	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
is[n't]	0
isn't	0
there	0
a	0
way	1
to	1
um	0
to	0
deregister	1
yourself	0
after	0
you	0
register	1
a	0
gun	0

ah	0

i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	0
i've	0
only	0
had	0
one	1
gun	0
and	0

because	0
i	0
have	0

and	0
i've	0
kept	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
the	0
one	0
gun	0
that	0
was	0
in	0
my	0
name	1

yeah	0
is	0
it	0
registered	0

yeah	0
i	0

the	0
um	0
the	0
rifle	0
that	0
i've	1
got	0
is	0
not	1
registered	0

and	0
um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
why	1
i	0
never	0
registered	0
it	0
but	0
the	0
uh	0

i	0
don't	0
think	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
register	0
a	0
shotgun	0

um	0
i'd	0
i'd	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
it's	0
voluntary	0
the	0
um	0
the	0

well	0
see	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	0
has	0
a	0
thing	1
if	0
they	1
go	0
to	0
uh	0
regulating	1
uh	0
all	1
right	0
uh	0
banning	0
guns	1
o[f]	0
pri[vate]	0
private	1
pri[vate]	1
private	1
ci[tizens]	0
citizens	1

yeah	0

this	0
my	0
kid	1
is	0
jumping	1
on	0
me	0
i	0
can't	0
hardly	0
talk	1

my	0
husband	0
feels	1
that	0
they'll	0
come	0
and	0
collect	0
everybody's	0
guns	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
that	0
could	0
happen	0
it's	0
just	0
like	1
the	0
uh	0
the	0
social	0
security	0
system	1
once	1
they	0
uh	0
they	0
gave	0
everybody	0
a	0
number	1
and	0
now	1
they're	0
making	0
you	1
um	0
uh	0
get	1
one	0
at	0
at	0
birth	1

and	0
once	0
they	0
have	1
your	0
number	0
they	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
your	0
identification	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
if	0
you	0
try	1
to	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
um	0
like	1
uh	0
not	0
identify	0
yourself	0
to	0
the	0
government	1
they	0
know	0
who	0
you	0
are	1

and	0
everything	0
about	0
you	0

and	0
that's	0
true	0

uh	0
i	0
bu[t]	0
you	0
know	0
they	0
know	1
it	0
from	0
how	0
much	0
money	0
you	0
make	0
a	0
week	1
to	1
uh	0
probably	1
your	1
uh	0
my	0
kid	0
is	0
banging	0
i	0
was	0
seeing	0
what	0
they	0
was	0
banging	1
on	0
uh	0
i've	0
lost	0
my	0
train	0
of	0
thought	1
i'm	0
sorry	0

that's	0
all	0
right	0
yeah	0
you	0
were	0
talking	0
about	1
uh	0
um	0
fed[eral]	1
what	0
the	0
federal	0
government	1
knows	0
about	0
people	1

oh	0
the	0
social	0

yeah	0
they	0
pr[obably]	0
they	0
probably	0
know	0
everything	1
from	0
half	1
the	0
time	0
wh[at]	0
ho[w]	0
what	0
time	0
you	0
go	0
to	0
the	0
bathroom	1

they	0
probably	0
do	0

no	0
that's	0
that's	0
a	0
little	0
bits	0
extreme	0
but	0
they	0
could	0
know	0
anything	0
and	0
everything	1
about	0
you	0
and	0
uh	0
i'd	0
like	0
to	0
have	0
my	0
gun	1
if	0
they	0
go	0
to	0
banning	1
banning	1
them_1	0
i'd	0
lose	0
my	0
gun	1
but	0
we	0
wouldn't	0
lose	0
our	0
pis[tol]	1
or	0
ou[r]	0
shotgun	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
we're	0
wanting	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
couple	0
more	1
that	0
no	0
one	0
knows	1
about	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
uh	0

do	0
you	0
find	0
it	0
difficult	1
picking	0
up	1
uh	0
guns	1
that	0
that	0
are	0
not	0
registered	1

naw	0

no	0
i	0
don't	0
either	0
i	1
can	0
i	0
can	0
buy	1
some	0
uh	0
today	1
if	0
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
just	0
you	0
know	0
put	0
up	0
the	0
money	0

yeah	0
w[ell]	0

yes	0
well	0
you	1
can	0
look	0
in	0
the	0
uh	0
the	0
we	0
got	1
the	0
thing	0
down	0
here	0
called	0
a	0
shopper	1

uh-huh	0

it's	0
a	0
a	0
who	1
a	0
it's	0
a	0
it's	0
a	0
bargain	1
thing	0
uh	0
you	0
go	1
and	0
everyb[ody]	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
always	0
see	0
guns	1
in	0
there	0
five	0
to	0
seven	0
guns	0
a	0
day	0

yeah	0

it	0
comes	0
out	0
every	0
tuesday	1

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
no	0
waiting	0
period	0
on	0
that	1

naw	0
[laughter-none]	0
whatsoever	0

you	0
ca[n]	0
call	0
w[e]	0
we	0
sold	0
a	0
refrigerator	1
through	0
it	0
and	1
it	0
took	0
us	0
all	0
of	0
twelve	1
hours	0

you	0
sell	0
the	0
refrigerator	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i'm	0
sure	0
it'd	0
be	0
even	1
less	0
for	0
somebody	0
with	0
a	0
good	0
gun	1

hm	0
yeah	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
federal	0
government	1
is	0
um	0
is	0
really	0
far	0
away	1
from	0
uh	0
um	0
control	1
i	1
i	0
don't	1
believe	1
in	0
um	0
should	0
i	0
shouldn't	1
probably	0
say	0
control	1
i	0
mean	0
regulation	0
control	1
is	0
something	0
that	0
i	0
wouldn't	1
want	0
the	0
federal	0
government	1
to	0
have	1
b[ut]	0
um	0
but	0
i	0
would	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
them	0
have	1
a	0
monitoring	0
capability	1
so	0
that	0
they	0
know	1
who	0
has	1
what	0
weapons	1

yeah	0
well	0
i'll	0
agree	0
with	0
you	0
there	1
they	0
do	0
have	0
too	0
much	0
control	0
over	0
us	0
already	1

yeah	0

uh	0
we	0
could	0
look	0
at	0
our	0
paychecks	1
and	0
see	0
how	0
much	0
control	0
they	0
have	1

unfortunately	1
we	1
uh	0
we	0
vote	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
people	0
who	0
spend	0
the	0
money	1
so	0
i	0
can't	0
complain	0
too	1
much	0

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
they're	0

okay	0
so	1
wh[at]	1
now	0
what	0
are	0
your	0
opinions	0
on	0
recycling	1

well	1
i	0
definitely	1
think	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
start	1
recycling	1
i	1
think	0
it	0
has	0
got	0
to	0
be	0
an	0
individual	1
responsibility	1
until	1
i	0
think	0
if	0
we	0
wait	1
uh	0
which	0
is	0
happening	1
until	1
somebody	0
says	0
we	0
have	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
it's	0
gonna	0
be	0
too	0
late	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
i've	0
heard	0
reports	1
around	0
here	0
that	0
the	0
landfills	1
will	0
be	0
full	1
by	0
the	0
year	0
two	0
thousand	1

yeah	1
i've	0
heard	0
that	0
too	1

and	0
that's	0
not	1
too	0
far	0
away	1
but	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
it	0
is	0
there	1
it's	0
very	0
difficult	1
here	1
even	0
if	0
you	0
care	1
like	0
i	1
do	0
to	0
do	0
much	1
i	0
take	1
my	0
pap[er]	1
i	0
can	0
take	0
plastic	1
and	0
paper	0
bags	1
back	0
to	0
the	0
grocery	0
store	1
and	0

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
can	0
take	1
plastic	1
like	0
milk	0
cartons	1
or	0
if	0
they	0
have	0
water	1
in	0
them_1	0
and	0
there's	0
some	0
fire	0
stations	1
i	0
can	0
take	0
newspapers	1
to	0
and	0
that	0
is	0
very	0
inconvenient	1
cause	0
i	0
have	0
to	0
wait	1
[un]til	0
i	0
have	0
enough	1
of	0
them	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
trip	0
worthwhile	1

well	0
see	0
i	0
had	0
started	0
saving	0
newspapers	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
save	0
a	0
ton	1
of	0
them_1	0

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	0
th[at's]	1
i	0
can't	0
remember	1
where	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
take	1
them_1	0
but	0
they	1
wou[ldn't]	0
they	0
wouldn't	0
take	1
them_1	0

yeah	1
it's	0
very	0
hard	0
to	0
find	0
a	0
spot	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
you	0
notice	1
even	0
doing	0
that	1
the	0
amount	0
of	0
trash	1
we	0
throw	0
away	1
is	0
incredible	1
bottles	1
that	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1

glass	1
that	0
cannot	0
be	1
it	0
could	0
be	0
recycled	1
but	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
place	1
to	0

there's	0
no	0
really	0
recycling	0
facilities	1

no	1
we	0
have	0
a	0
pilot	0
program	1
in	0
arlington	1
going	0
on	1
i	0
think	0
in	0
the	0
north	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
city	1
where	1
they're	0
having	0
people	1
separate	1
the	0
garbage	1
as	0
the	0
trash	1
as	0
they	0
put	0
it	0
out	1

i	0
think	0
that's	0
a	0
good	0
idea	1

and	0
i	1
think	0
that's	0
what	0
it	0
is	0
gonna	0
have	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
where	0
we're	0
just	0
forced	1
to	0

besides	1
well	0
like	0
a	0
law	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
that's	1
how	0
it	0
is	0
in	0
new	0
york	1
or	0
isn't	1
it	0

yeah	1

i	0
think	0
so	1
it's	0
just	0
because	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
you	1
know	0

um-hum	1

you	0
get	0
ticketed	1
if	0
you	0
don't	0
do	0
it	0
right	1

right	1
uh-huh	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
going	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
that	0
because	0
some	0
people	1
will	0
just	0
not	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
it's	0
a	1
it's	0
trouble	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
do	0
what	0
i	0
do	1
i	0

yeah	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
am	0
willing	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
but	0

plus	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
place	0
to	0
store	1
all	0
of	0
it	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
see	0
i	0
live	0
in	0
an	0
apartment	1

yeah	0
it's	0
very	0
difficult	1
like	0
our	0
garage	1
is	0
always	0
full	0
of	0
stacks	0
of	0
newspapers	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0
think	0
there	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
more	0

i	0
don't	0
think	0
that	0
there's	1
enough	0
being	0
done	1
now	1
i	0
work	1
at	0
jc	1
penney	0
at	0
their	0
corporate	0
headquarters	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
we	1
have	0
a	0
paper	0
recycling	1
program	1
that's	0
um	0
company	0
wide	1
and	0
i	0
do	0
the	0
recycling	0
for	0
that	1

do	0
they	0
save	1
like	0
the	0
paper	1
the[y]	1
they	0
use	1
like	0
the	0
office	0
paper	1

yeah	1

good	1
because_1	0
there	0
is	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
waste	1
there	0
isn't	1
there	0

yeah	1
i	0
know	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
computer	0
paper	1
though	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
use	0

right	1

right	1

but	0
um	0
we	0
use	0
to	0
have	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
i	0
don't	0
even	0
remember	0
how	0
much	0
money	1
that	0
they've	1
um	1
m[ean]	1
i	0
mean	1
the	0
money	0
that	0
they've	0
made	0
from	0
the	0
recycling	0
program	1
they've	0
donated	1
it	0
to	0
charities	1

right	1

i	0
mean	1
they've	0
made	0
a	0
substantial	0
amount	0
of	0
money	1
from	0
it	0

yeah	1

something	0
else	1
i	0
think	0
we	0
can	0
do	1
is	0
support	0
companies	1
that	0
encourage	1
like	1
i've	1
decided	0
downy	1
fabric	0
softener	1
now	0
has	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
buy	0
a	0
little	0
carton	1

yeah	1

you	0
add	0
water	1
i'll	1
i	0
image	1
everybody	0
else	0
will	0
start	0
doing	1
that	0
sooner	0
or	0
later	1
but	0
i	0
am	0
going	0
to	0
stick	0
with	0
downy	1
because	0
they	0
were	0
first	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
i	0
want	0
them	0
to	0
have	0
my	0
business	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
packaging	1
could	0
be	0
done	1
much	0
better	1
there	0
is	0
so	0
much	0
plastic	1
that	1

well	0
now	0
you	0
see	1
some	0
of	0
this	0
stuff	1
and	0
you're	1
and	0
then	0
when	0
they	0
come	0
out	0
with	0
the	0
new	1
things	0
you	0
are	0
like	1
uh	0
well	0
why	0
didn't	0
you	0
think	0
of	0
that	0
before	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
just	0
people	0
have	0
got	0
to	0
be	0
aware	1
unfortunately	1
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	1
that	0
just	0
don't	0
care	1
and	0
they	0
don't	0
wanna	0
think	0
about	1
it	0

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

and	1
uh	0
i	0
just	0
look	1
at	0
it	0
as	0
i	0
don't	0
want	0
my	0
grandchildren	1
looking	1
at	0
me	0
and	0
saying	0
why	0
didn't	0
you	0
do	0
something	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
want	0
to	0
feel	0
like	0
i	0
at	0
least	0
tried	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
it	0
just	0
may	0
overwhelm	1
us	0
here	1
when	0
we	0
run	0
out	0
of	0
places	0
to	0
put	1
it	0
then	0
we'll	0
be	0
forced	1
to	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
too	0
late	1

do	0
they	0
not	1
ever	0
i	0
mean	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
much	1
do	0
they	0
not	0
ever	1
burn	0
trash	1
or	0
anything	1
like	1

very	0
little	1
that's	0
another	1
thing	0
and	0
if	0
you've	0
ever	0
know	1
like	0

then	0
that's	0
pollution	1

i	0
know	0
amway	1
i	0
only	0
use	0
a	0
couple	0
things	0
form	0
amway	1
that	0
it	0
says	1
this	1
is	1
burnable	1
material	1
well	1
that	0
doesn't	0
do	0
me	0
any	0
good	1
because	0
i	0
don't	0
have	0
any	0
place	0
to	0
burn	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
i	0
guess	0
you	0
run	0
into	0
the	0
pollution	0
factor	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	1
just	0
like	0
the	0
glass	1
bottles	1
th[at]	0
that	0
says	0
on	0
the	0
bottle	1
i	0
can	0
get	0
ten	0
cents	1
but	0
not	0
in	0
texas	1

yeah	1

and	0
there's	0
no	1
place	0
i	0
can	0
take	0
glass	1
to	0

so	1
i	0
still	0
throw	0
away	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
glass	1

truly	0
sad	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
the	0
packaging	1
really	0
grips	1
me	0
you	0
buy	1
something	1
it's	0
got	0
a	0
great	0
big	0
piece	0
of	0
cardboard	1
and	0
a	0
great	0
big	0
piece	0
of	0
plas[tic]	1

uh	0
being	0
a	1
former	0
drug	0
user	1
i	1
uh	0
i'd	0
i	0
guess	0
i	0
have	0
to	0
say	0
at	0
this	1
point	0
that	0
i	1
do	0
approve	1
of	0
it	0

whoa	1

uh-huh	0

uh	1
because	0
i	0
know	1
that	1
uh	0
in	1
using	1
drugs	1
i	1
was	0
not	0
a	1
good	0
employee	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
so	1
i	0
can	0
see	0
from	0
the	0
company's	0
standpoint	1
that	1
there	1
uh	0
whenever	0
you	0
are	0
an	0
employee	0
of	0
the	0
company	1
you	0
are	0
using	0
it's	0
assets	1
and	1
uh	0
a[nd]	1
bu[t]	0
you're	0
also	0
under	0
their	0
liability	1
under	0
the	0
workmen's	0
comp	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
on	0
my	0
job	1
we	0
had	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
workmen's	0
comp	0
cases	1
and	1
uh	0
i	0
work	0
for	0
a	0
tire	0
company	1
modern	0
tire	1

where	0
do	0
you	0
work	1

oh	1

and	1
uh	0
it's	0
also	0
a	0
retreading	0
plant	1
and	0
that's	0
where	0
most	0
of	0
our	1
uh	0
injuries	0
occur	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
what	0
we	0
do	1
is	0
we'll	0
have	0
a	0
drug	1
test	0
i[f]	0
if	0
an	1
if	1
a	1
a	0
boy	1
or	0
a	0
man	1
uh	1
has	0
an	0
accident	1
then	0
he's	1
automatically	1
uh	0
given	0
a	0
drug	0
test	1

right	1
do	0
they	0
do	0
it	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
within	0
hours	1
of	0
the	0
accident	1
or	0
is	0
it	1

yes	1
when	0
he	0
goes	0
to	0
the	0
doctor	0
the	0
first	0
time	1

yeah	0

and	1
so	1
that	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
been	0
a	0
deterrent	0
or	0
not	1
because	0
we	1
have	0
uh	0
just	0
started	0
using	1
it	0
oh	1
for	0
the	0
past	0
year	0
or	0
so	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

now	0
we've	1
let	0
some	0
people	0
go	1
uh	0
that	0
well	0
it	0
was	0
found	0
that	0
drugs	0
were	0
used	0
in	0
their	0
system	1
now	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	1
tec	1
would	0
handle	1
it	0
they	0
haven't	0
pursued	1
it	0
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

uh	0
if	0
there's	0
some	1
uh	0
problem	1
i	0
know	1
there	0
was	0
one	1
guy	0
that	0
we	0
tested	0
for	0
preemployment	1
for	0
drugs	1
who	1
absolutely	0
swore	0
up	0
and	0
down	1
that	1
it	0
showed	0
that	1
he	0
was	0
using	0
amphetamines	1
and	0
he	0
went	0
to	1
a	1
a	1
separate	1
drug	0
testing	0
firm	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
they	1
showed	1
it	0
negative	1

huh	1

so	1
i	0
think	0
the	0
tests	0
themselves	1
are	0
not	0
really	0
that	1
cut	0
and	0
dried	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
probably	0
true	1
too	1
that's	1
that's	1
that's	0
sort	0
of	0
scary	1

uh-huh	1
really	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
also	0
had	0
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	1
uh	0
just	0
around	1
some	0
people	0
that	0
were	1
smoking	0
cocaine	1

yeah	1

and	0
he	0
tested	0
positive	0
on	0
cocaine	1
now	0
then	1
you	0
always	0
wonder	1
well	1
is	0
he	0
just	0
saying	0
that	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
yeah	1
really	1
really	1

yeah	0

yeah	1
that's	1
that's	0
a	0
bad	1
situation	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
probably	1
i	0
think	0
most	0
companies	0
now	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
entry	1
you	1
know	0
exams	1
require	1
that	0
i	0

um-hum	0

yeah	0

i	0
think	0
they	0
should	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	0
a	0
ti	0
employee	1
and	1
and	1
and	1
uh	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
really	0
gung	0
ho	0
for	1
it	0
in	0

uh-huh	0

in	0
fact	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
places	0
now	1
um	0
like	0
ibm	1
don't	0
allow	0
even	0
smoking	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
plant	1

uh-huh	0

right	1

we	1
we	0
have	0
designated	0
smoking	0
areas	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
work	1
in	0
sort	1
of	0
a	0
building	1
that's	0
that's	0
not	0
really	1
it	1
well	0
it's	0
on	0
the	0
campus	1
of	1
the	0
ti	0
facility	1
but	0
it's	0
a	0
little	0
bit	1
you	1
know	0
separated	1
we	0
lease	0
the	0
building	1
and	0
it's	0
m[ainly]	0
it's	0
a	0
factory	0
environment	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
they	1
they	0
have	0
designated	0
smoking	1
but	0
it's	0
just	0
wide	0
open	1
it's	0
not	1
ventilated	0
properly	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
bad	1
but	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
the	0
drugs	1
you	1
know	0
being	0
in	0
the	0
factory	1
kind	0
of	0
environment	0
that	0
way	1
i	0
think	0
it's	1
a	0
it's	0
a	0
definite	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
essential	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

yeah	1
because	0
you're	1
endangering	0
everybody's	0
lives	1
if	0
you've	0
if	0
it's	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	1

in	0
fact	1
we've	0
had	0
the	0
policy	1
on	0
just	0
the	0
random	0
testing	0
now	1
for	1
a	0
couple	0
years	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
was	1
giving	0
my	0
boss	0
a	0
hard	0
time	1
because	1
i	0
kept	0
waiting	0
for	0
my	0
name	0
to	0
came	1
come	0
up	1
you	1
know	0
they	0

they	0
never	1
they	0
never	0
called	1
me	0
they	0
never	1
you	1
know	0
then	0
finally	1
the	0
day	0
we	0
declared	0
war	1
was	0
my	0
time	1

[laughter-you're]	1
kidding	1

[laughter-no]	1
and	0
so	1
and	1
and	0
my	0
boss	1
has	1
has	0
gone	0
for	0
about	0
like	1
three	1
times	1
i	0
think	1
and	0
i	0
told	0
him	1
he's	0
obviously	0
in	0
a	0
high	0
risk	0
group	1

the	0
executives	1
right	1

right	1
right	1
and	0
of	0
course	1
you	1
know	0
they	1
they	0
did	1
specifically	0
single	0
them	1
out	0
when	0
we	0
started	1
you	1
know	0
that	0
they	1
were	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
all	0
them	0
first	1

the	0
executives	1

uh-huh	0

wouldn't	0
that	0
be	0
awful	1
if	0

you	0
were	0
using	1
and	1
and	1
oh	1

of	0
drawbacks	1

you	0
want	0
to	0
think	1
that	0
that	0
you're	0
working	1
with	0
people	1
who	0
are	0
not	0
only	0
putting	0
out	0
their	0
fair	0
share	1
but	0
that	0
are	0
not	0
endangering	0
your	0
life	1
in	0

that's	0
right	1

in	0
some	0
cases	1
like	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

like	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	1
uh	0
several	0
years	0
back	1
worked	0
for	0
motorola	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	0
had	1
you	0
know	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
was	1
a	0
chemical	1
handling	1
type	1

oh	0
goodness	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	1
and	0
they	0
have	1
they	0
have	0
some	0
serious	1
chemicals	1
out	0
there	1
you	1
know	0
like	0

yeah	1

like	0
they	0
have	1
emergency	0
shower	1
where	0
you	0
just	0
run	1
in	0
there	0
and	0
strip	1
off	0
and	0
dump	0
water	1
you	1
know	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
thing	1

yeah	1

and	0
they	0
had	0
people	0
out	0
there	1
using	0
all	0
sorts	0
of	0
drugs	1
handling	0
those	0
chemicals	1

oh	0
my	0
gosh	1

you	0
know	0
that's	0
really	1
that's	0
really	0
frightening	1
so	0

yeah	1

so	0
i	0
think	0
some	0
place	1
you	1
know	0
places	1
like	0
that	1
it	0
should	0
be	1
like	1
mandatory	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
on	0
on	1
a	0
on	0
a	0
greater	0
frequency	1
than	1
than	0
maybe	1
just	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
paper	0
pushers	1
like	1
like	0
i	1
am	0

uh-huh	1

right	1

i	0
would	0
think	0
they	0
would	1
be	0

well	1
you	0
well	1
you'd	0
think	0
so	1
but	1
uh	1

but	1
they	0
weren't	1

i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
they	0
do	0
it	0
[un]til	0
yet	1

isn't	0
that	0
awful	1

because	1
when	0
he	1
was	0
at	0
course	1
now	0
it's	0
been	0
years	1
now	0
because	0
it	0
was	0
before	1
it	0
was	0
even	0
before	0
they	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
designated	0
smoking	1
type	0
stuff	0
you	0
know	0
at	0
ti	1
i	0

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

i	0
forgot	0
what	1
i	0
guess	0
it	0
was	0
like	1
eighty	1
four	1
eighty	0
five	1
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	1
at	0
that	0
time	1
they	0
had	0
no	0
testing	1
whatsoever	1

huh	0

so	1
that's	0
scary	1

yeah	1
that's	1
reminds	1
me	0
of	0
uh	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
friend	0
who	0
was	0
telling	0
me	0
about	0
her	0
brother	1
who	0
gets	0
high	0
all	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
have	1
just	0
casually	0
asked	0
her	0
what	0
he	0
did	0
for	0
a	0
living	1
and	0
she	0
said	1
oh	0
he's	0
the	0
supervisor	0
of	0
this	0
chemical	0
land	1
fill	0
you	0
know	0
where	0
they	0
go	0
and	0
dump	1
all	0
this	1
toxic	0
stuff	1

oh	1
lord	1

oh	1

and	0
i	0
just	1
you	0
know	0
went	0
oh	1
[laughter-where]	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
yeah	0
should	0
we	0
move	1

let	0
me	0
move	1
as	0
far	0
away	0
as	0
possible	1

ooh	1

yeah	1

that's	0
awful	1

but	1
i'm	0
proud	0
though	0
that	1
that	1
um	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
grew	0
up	0
in	0
the	0
sixties	1
and	0
back	0
then	1
it	0
was	0
popular	1
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

but	0
people	0
have	0
really	0
wisened	1
you	1
know	0
become	1
wise	1
about	0
drugs	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
they	0
really	0
have	0
a	0
good	0
campaign	1
for	0
the	0
young	0
people	1
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

they	0
know	1
it's	0
not	0
smart	1
so	1
so	1
i	0
guess	0
it	0
was	0
just	1
a	0
generational	0
thing	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
peer	0
group	1
is	0
the	0
other	0
way	1
now	1
instead	1
of	0

that's	0
right	1
and	0
that's	1
good	1

uh-huh	0
that's	1

that's	0
the	0
best	0
way	0
to	0
stop	1
it	0

yeah	1
that	1
it	0
really	1
is	0

yeah	1
well	1
i	0
think	0
we	0
did	1
it	0

[laughter-okay]	1
well	0

it's	0
good	0
talking	0
to	0
you	1

well	0
i	0
enjoyed	0
talking	1
talking	0
to	0
you	0
cathy	1

yeah	1
bye-bye	1

i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
the	1
the	1
last	1
thing	0
i've	1
done	0
far	0
as	0
car	0
repairs	1
go	1
is	1
is	0
change	1
oil	1
and	0
filter	1
an	1
and	0
that	0
kind	1
of	0
stuff	1
i	0
haven't	0
gotten	1
really	0
involved	0
in	0
anything	1
uh	0
extensive	1
in	0
car	0
repairs	1
in	0
oh	0
oh	0
probably	0
a	0
year	1
or	0
so	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
last	1
thing	0
i	0
did	0
of	0
any	1
significance	1
was	0
change	1
the	0
water	1
pump	0
on	0
an	0
oldsmobile	1

yeah	1
i	0
had	1
a	0
similar	0
thing	1
that	0
i've	1
worked	0
on	0
cars	1
ever	0
since	0
i	0
was	1
uh	0
a	0
kid	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
some	0
time	0
ago	1
but	0
i've	0
gotten	0
to	1
the	0
point	1
where	0
uh	1
the	0
newer	0
cars	1
are	0
getting	1
so	0
complicated	0
to	0
work	1
on	0
that	1
uh	1
oh	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
cars	1
i	0
buy	1
i	0
try	0
to	0
buy	1
as	0
simple	0
a	0
car	0
as	1
possible	1

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
mean	0

so	0
you	0
know	0
changing	0
the	0
oil	1
changing	0
the	0
spark	0
plugs	1
and	1
most	0
of	1
them	0
now	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
don't	0
go	0
through	0
the	0
ignition	0
stuff	0
anymore	1
because	0
that's	0
all	0
solid	0
state	1
or	0
or	0
fuel	0
injected	1
so	0

yeah	0
they're	0
fuel	0
injected	0
and	0
so	0
there's	0

so	0
there	0
goes	0
the	0
carburetor	0
and	0
if	0
the	0
fuel	0
injection	0
system	0
breaks	0
down	1
there's	0
no	0
way	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
that	1

yeah	0

no	0
there's	0
no	0
way	0
somebody	0
once	1
said	0
uh	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
car	0
that	0
said	1
fuel	0
injection	0
on	0
the	0
side	0
of	0
it	1
and	0
a	0
woman	0
asked	0
me	0
what	0
that	0
meant	1
and	0
i	0
said	0
that	0
means	1
that	0
i	0
can't	0
work	1
on	0
it	0

oh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
basically	0
that's	0
it	0

you	0
know	0
they've	0
gotten	0
so	0
complicated	1
or	0
so	0
high	0
tech	1
that	0
uh	0
the	0
guys	1
average	0
guys	1
can't	0
really	0
go	0
out	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
garage	1
and	1
do	0
a	0
whole	0
lot	0
of	0
repairs	1
uh	0

yeah	0
i've	0
got	1
uh	0
an	0
eighty	0
four	0
chevy	0
van	1
that's	1
uh	0
a	0
one	0
ton	0
van	1
with	0
a	0
camper	0
conversion	1
on	0
it	0

yeah	0

it's	0
got	1
the	0
the	1
the	0
good	0
old	0
three	0
fifty	1
standard	0
engine	1
in	0
it	0

absolutely	0

regular	0
gas	0
engine	0
and	0
that	0
engine	0
i	0
understand	1
i	0
can	1
i	0
can	0
actually	0
work	1
on	0
that	0
engine	0

yeah	0
i	0
used	1
to	1
have	0
uh	0
chevy	0
van	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
short	1
van	0
that	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	1
in	0
it	0

yeah	0

uh-hum	0

and	0
basically	1
it	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
motor	1
and	0
you	0
didn't	0
have	0
all	0
the	0
other	0
junk	0
around	1
it	0

right	0

and	0
you	0
could	0
get	0
to	0
it	1
to	0
work	1
on	0
it	0

yeah	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
change	0
the	0
water	0
pump	0
in	0
that	1
here	0
about	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
and	0
it	0
was	0
really	0
fairly	0
easy	1
take	0
the	0
grill	0
out	1
and	0
the	0
radiator	0
out	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
just	0
stand	0
there	0
and	0
work	1
on	1
it	0

yeah	0
the	0
hardest	1
part	0
about	0
uh	0
water	0
pump	0
changes	1
is	0
getting	0
all	0
the	0
junk	1
off	0
before	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
too	1
it	0

well	0
that's	0
true	0
that	0
you're	0
right	0
you	0
know	0
by	0
the	0
time	0
you've	0
finally	0
got	0
down	0
to	0
it	1
i	0
was	0
hoping	0
i	0
could	0
remember	0
where	0
all	0
those	0
other	1
things	0
went	1

well	0
that's	0
kind	0
of	1
the	0
way	0
i	0
was	1
i	0
tried	1
to	0
remember	0
as	0
i	1
took	0
stuff	0
off	1
where	0
it	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
i	0
had	0
too	0
many	0
nuts	0
and	0
bolts	0
left	0
over	1
when	1
i	0
got	0
it	0
all	0
put	0
back	0
together	1

a	0
few	0
years	0
ago	0
i	0
had	0
an	0
oldsmobile	0
diesel	1
and	0
uh	0
the	0
uh	0
it	0
after	0
about	0
a	0
hundred	0
thousand	0
miles	1
the	0
injector	0
pump	0
went	0
out	1
on	0
it	0
and	1
uh	0
i	1
bought	0
it	0
when	0
we	0
were	0
living	0
in	0
lubbock	1
when	0
i	0
came	0
back	0
here	1
i	0
brought	0
the	0
car	0
back	0
here	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
diesels	0
got	0
pretty	0
unpopular	0
and	0
you	0
couldn't	0
sell	1
the	0
thing	0
i	0
mean	0
though	0
for	1
what	0
you	0
could	0
get	0
for	0
one	1
you	0
might	0
as	0
well	0
drive	0
it	0
over	0
a	0
cliff	1

oh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
the	0
injector	0
pump	0
went	0
bad	0
so	0
i	1
found	1
an	0
outfit	0
down	0
here	0
to	0
rebuild	1
it	0
and	1
uh	0
i	1
reinstalled	0
that	1
and	0

and	0
that	0
was	0
probably	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
miserable	1
things	0
i	0
had	0
gotten	0
into	0
in	0
a	0
long	0
time	1

i	0
don't	0
think	0
i'd	0
know	0
where	0
to	0
start	0
with	0
a	0
diesel	1

uh	0
well	0
if	0
you	0
know	0
diesels	0
don't	0
require	0
mechanics	1
they	0
require	0
plumbers	0

well	0
that's	0
true	0

and	0
uh	0

i	0
think	0
the	0
onl[y]	1
closest	0
thing	1
i've	0
come	1
to	0
to	0
a	0
diesel	1
is	0
i've	0
worked	1
for	0
a	0
tractor	0
repair	0
shop	1
uh	0
when	0
i	0
was	0
in	0
high	1
school	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
used	1
to	0
overhaul	1
farm	0
tractors	0
basically	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	0
were	0
nearly	0
all	1
all	0
diesel	1
but	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
cars	1
i've	0
never	1
never	0
been	0
involved	1
with	0
them	0

well	0
the	0
injector	1
nozzle	1
and	0
stuff	0
in	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
big	1
diesel	0
farm	0
tractors	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
are	0
about	0
the	0
size	0
of	0
your	1
thumb	1
and	1
the	0

well	0
ye[ah]	0
yeah	0
and	0
you	1
ca[n]	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
to	1
them	0

yeah	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
to	0
them	1
and	0
the	0
ones	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
diesel	0
cars	1
were	0
little	0
tiny	0
things	1
and	0
just	0
almost	0
impossible	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
with	0

well	0
i	0

i've	0
had	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
good	0
service	0
out	0
of	0
that	0
car	1
but	0
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
finally	0
gave	0
it	0
to	0
my	0
son	1
and	0
he	1
drove	0
it	0
literally	0
into	0
the	0
ground	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

yeah	0

he	0
was	0
out	0
at	0
tech	1
and	0
he	1
he	0
finished	0
it	0
off	1

i'm	0
i	0
guess	0
you're	0
right	0
the	0
the	0
diesel	0
has	0
almost	0
fallen	0
into	1
unpopular	0
status	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
exactly	0
why	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
reasons	0
is	0
i	1
i'm	1
beginning	0
to	0
wonder	1
is	0
where	0
do	0
you	0
get	0
gas	1
at	0
i	0
su[re]	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
still	1
uh	0
limited	1
like	0
it	0
was	1
i	0
don't	1
notice	1
it	0
probably	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0

what	0
the	0
availability	0

huh	0

you	0
mean	0
the	0
diesel	0
availability	0

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
notice	0
but	0
maybe	0
because	0
i'm	0
not	0
looking	1
for	0
it	0

yeah	0
well	0
i'd	0
bought	1
uh	0
a	0
gmc	1
diesel	0
pickup	1
and	1
uh	0
loved	1
that	0
thing	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
really	0
liked	0
it	0
but	0
it	0
turns	0
out	0
a	0
pickup	0
wasn't	0
what	0
i	0
really	1
needed	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
the	0
van	1
that	0
i	0
needed	0
then	0
to	0
buying	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
traded	0
it	0
in	0
on	0
the	0
chevy	0
van	1
but	1
uh	0
i	0
sure	0
enjoyed	1
it	0

but	0
you	0
you	0
got	1
the	0
you	0
got	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	0
in	0
the	0
van	1

yeah	0
yeah	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	0
regular	0
gas	0
engine	0

yeah	0
that's	0
what	0
i	0
like	0
because	1
they've	0
got	0
plenty	0
of	0
power	1
and	0
uh	0
if	0
you	0
treat	0
them	0
right	0
they're	0
not	1
the	0
gas	0
guzzlers	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
they've	1
got	0
the	0
reputation	0
to	0
be	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	0
convinced	1
that	0
uh	0
detroit	0
or	0
whoever	1
it	0
is	0
made	0
a	0
major	0
mistake	0
years	1
ago	0
when	0
they	0
stopped	0
putting	0
the	0
small	0
v	0
eights	1
in	0
and	0
went	1
to	0
the	0
fours	1
and	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
sixes	1

yeah	0
well	0

i'm	0
convinced	1
that	0
the	0
small	1
v	0
eight	1
like	0
the	0
the	0
mustang's	0
original	0
two	0
eighty	0
nine	1
or	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
chevy	0
two	0
eighty	0
threes	1
were	0
good	0
little	1
v	0
eight	0
engines	1
that	0
were	0
not	0
gas	0
guzzlers	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
they	0
had	0
enough	0
power	1
to	0
pull	0
all	0
this	0
weight	1

yeah	0

and	0
the	0
four	0
cylinders	0
just	0
don't	0
have	1
it	0

think	0
that	1
little	1
the	0
little	0
chevy	0
v	0
eight	0
when	1
it	0
started	1
out	0
in	0
sixty	0
in	0
fifty	0
five	1
i	0
think	0
was	0
two	0
sixty	0
five	1
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

little	0
you	0
know	0
not	0
a	0
hold	0
lot	0
more	0
than	0
the	0
than	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
was	0
like	1
about	0
for	0
about	0
two	0
thirty	0
five	1
or	0
something	0
but	0
uh	0
they	1
kept	0
boring	0
that	0
block	0
out	0
to	0
where	1
you	0
could	0
a	0
get	0
a	0
four	0
hundred	1
small	0
block	0
four	0
hundred	0
that	0
was	1
uh	0
the	0
same	0
block	1
you	0
know	1
just	1
just	0
kept	0
boring	0
it	0
out	1
and	0
boring	0
it	0
out	1
and	0
stroking	0
it	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
yeah	0

i	0
think	0
those	1
g[uys]	0
those	0
little	0
v	0
eights	1
could	0
have	0
been	0
made	1
to	0
be	0
pretty	0
powerful	0
little	0
engines	1
if	0
they	0
would	0
have	0
gone	0
with	1
it	0
but	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
short	0
stroke	0
engine	1
it	0
could	0
really	0
wind	0
up	1

oh	1
yeah	0

the	0
two	0
little	0
cars	0
i've	0
got	0
now	1
bought	0
a	0
mitsubishi	0
mirage	0
here	0
a	0
couple	0
years	0
ago	1
and	0
and	0
it	0
was	1
normally	0
carbureted	1
and	0
it's	0
fairly	1
easy	0
to	0
to	0
work	0
with	0
because	0
there's	0
not	0
just	0
a	0
whole	0
lot	1
in	0
it	0
to	0
go	0
wrong	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
changing	0
the	0
plugs	0
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
that's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	1

the	0
the	0
first	1
well	0
my	0
first	0
car	0
was	0
a	0
fifty	0
six	0
mustang	1
and	0
uh	0
over	0
the	0
years	0
uh	0
all	0
i	0
had	1
a	0
uh	0
dodge	1
pickup	1
several	0
years	0
ago	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
can't	0
remember	0
the	0
size	0
of	0
the	0
engine	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
three	0
o	1
seven	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
remember	0
working	0
on	0
those	0
cars	1
you'd	0
open	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
there	0
was	0
basically	0
nothing	0
in	1
there	0
but	0
an	0
engine	1
and	0
a	0
few	0
things	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

now	1
you	0
open	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
it's	0
scary	0

yeah	0

like	0
you	0
say	1
it	0
takes	0
a	0
plumber	1
to	0
figure	0
out	0
where	0
all	0
this	0
stuff	0
goes	1

the	0
friend	0
of	0
ours	0
over	0
here	0
he's	0
got	1
uh	0
sixty	0
five	1
or	0
sixty	0
six	0
mustang	1
with	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
look	0
under	0
the	0
hood	0
of	0
that	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
and	1
like	0
you	1
say	0
you	0
can	0
see	0
the	0
road	1

yeah	0

it's	0
amazing	0

well	0
if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
you	0
could	0
climb	0
up	0
in	1
there	0
and	0
do	0
what	0
you	0
needed	1
to	0

you	0
could	1
yeah	1
you	0
could	0
stand	0
in	0
there	0
if	0
you	0
really	0
wanted	1
to	0
i	0
guess	1

my	0
dad's	0
got	0
a	0
new	1
um	0
i	0
guess	0
it's	0
an	0
eighty	0
nine	0
or	0
ninety	1
uh	0
chrysler	1
something	1
or	0
other	0
it's	0
one	0
those	0
transverse	0
mounted	1
v	0
sixes	1
front	0
wheel	0
drive	1

oh	0
yeah	0

and	0
uh	1
he	0
was	0
showing	0
it	0
to	0
me	1
and	0
we're	0
looking	0
under	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
everything's	0
nice	0
and	0
clean	0
and	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
can	0
see	0
the	0
three	0
spark	0
plugs	0
there	0
in	0
the	0
front	1
and	0
i	0
said	0
well	0
where	0
are	0
the	0
other	0
three	0

and	1
he	0
had	0
never	0
really	0
thought	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	0

and	0
he	0
says	0
well	0
hopefully	0
i	0
won't	0
have	0
to	0
change	1
them	0
before	0
i	0
trade	0
it	0
off	1
yeah	0
it's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
problem	0
getting	0
back	1
there	0
because	0
it	0
was	0
shoved	0
right	0
up	0
against	0
the	0
fire	0
wall	1

yeah	0

so	0
they	0
just	0
about	0
complicated	0
the	0
things	0
so	0
much	1
that	0
shade	0
tree	0
mechanics	0
can't	0
do	0
much	0
with	1
them	0

yeah	0
well	0
when	0
they	0
went	0
to	0
the	1
started	0
with	0
the	0
newer	0
engines	1
you	0
know	0
when	0
they	0
started	0
putting	0
all	0
that	0
pollution	0
control	0
stuff	0
on	0
the	0
older	0
engines	0
is	0
where	0
they	0
started	0
getting	0
into	0
so	0
much	0
you	1
know	0
trouble	0
because	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	1
with	0
all	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
like	0
well	0
actually	0
i	0
guess	0
here	0
within	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	0
ago	0
anyway	0
was	0
the	0
last	0
i've	0
paid	0
any	0
attention	1
to	0
it	0
the	0
three	0
o	0
five	0
was	0
that	1
that	0
v	0
eight	1
that	0
they	0
put	0
in	0
the	1
the	0
three	0
quarter	1
and	0
and	0
half	0
ton	0
van	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
it	0
had	0
all	0
the	0
air	0
pump	1
and	0
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
all	1
that	0
all	0
that	0
stuff	1

right	0

yeah	0
the	0
antismog	0
pumps	0

and	0
all	0
the	0
antismog	0
stuff	0
and	0
uh	0
boy	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
really	0
a	0
mess	0
back	0
under	0
there	1
under	0
the	1
in	0
that	0
van	1

and	0
all	0
that	0
stuff	0
loads	1
the	0
motor	1
down	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

so	0
it's	0
trying	0
to	0
push	0
the	0
weight	1
plus	0
have	0
all	0
this	0
drain	1
on	0
it	0
from	0
all	0
sorts	1
of	0
belts	0
and	0
things	1
but	0

uh	0
eight	0
ninety	1
uh	0

uh	0
belt	1
on	0

a	0
serpentine	0
belt	1

i	0
had	0
to	0
get	0
all	0
those	0
off	1
you	0
know	0
when	1
i	0
was	0
replace	0
that	0
uh	0
water	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
struggle	0
with	0
that	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
to	0
figure	0
which	0
belt	0
goes	0
where	1

yeah	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	0
the	0
inside	0
dual	0
on	0
a	0
truck	1
you	0
know	0
when	0
one	0
of	0
them	0
breaks	1

not	0
the	0
outside	1
one	0
it's	1

oh	0
man	0

the	1
it's	0
usually	0
that	0
power	1
steering	0
belt	0
or	0
something	1
that's	0
way	0
back	0
in	0
there	1

bet	0
everything	0

this	0

uh	0
i've	0
got	1
uh	0
five	0
stickers	0
here	1
from	0
ti	1
so	0
i	0
guess	0
i've	0
done	1
probably	1
uh	0
i'd	0
say	0
seven	0
or	0
eight	1
of	0
them	0

yeah	0
i	0
hadn't	1
uh	0
hadn't	1
not	0
gotten	0
any	0

in	0
the	0
last	1
uh	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
first	0
one	0
in	0
a	0
week	0
or	0
so	1

yeah	0
i	0
haven't	0
gotten	0
any	0
calls	0
in	0
two	1
weeks	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	1
if	0
it's	0
tapering	0
off	1
or	0
or	0
what	1

if	0
it's	0
winding	0
down	0
or	0
what	1

i	0

a	0
difficult	0
time	1
the	0
past	0
couple	0
of	0
times	0
of	0
getting	1
uh	0
answers	1

finding	0
a	0
taker	0

so	0
it	0
sounds	0
it's	1
taken	0
them	0
ten	0
fifteen	0
minutes	0
at	0
a	0
time	1
so	1
people	0
or	0
either	0
not	1
or	0

i	0
am	1
from	0
kentucky	1
originally	1

oh	0
well	1

the	0
topic	1
today	0

gardening	1
and	1
lawn	0
care	1

uh-huh	0

ooh	0

i	0
know	0
we're	0
about	0
to	0
hit	1
it	0
here	1
a	0
few	0
minutes	1
i	0
figured	1
i	0
c[ould]	0
make	0
this	0
call	1
and	0
get	0
it	0
over	1
with	0
we	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
mow	0
and	0
trim	0
and	0
edge	0

oh	0

[tha]t's	0
all	0
we	0
have	0
been	0
doing	1
all	0
weekend	1

you	0
know	0
what	0
it	0
seems	0
like	0
we	0
are	0
doing	0
it	0
here	1
forever	1
we	0
bought	1
a	0
a	0
large	0
house	1
that	0
was	0
completely	0
unlandscaped	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
it	0
was	0
pro[bably]	0
probably	1
was	0
up	0
to	0
your	0
shoulder	1
in	0
in	0
thistles	1
that	1

that	1
was	0
all	0
that	0
was	0
there	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
we	0
hired	0
a	0
professional	0
landscaper	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
and	0
i	0
have	0
since	0
then	0
probably	0
ripped	1
out	0
half	1
of	0
what	0
he	0
has	0
done	0
because	0
it	0
has	0
always	0
been	0
incorrectly	1
planted	0
or	0
the	0
plants	0
do	0
not	0
make	0
the	0
winter	1
time	0
and	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
am	0
kind	0
of	0
at	0
this	0
point	1
getting	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
broke	1
and	0
deciding	1
that	0
what	0
we	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
we	0
are	0
just	0
going	0
to	0
struggle	0
through	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
this	0
year	1
probably	1
through	0
the	0
fall	1
too	0
and	0
uh	1
rip	1
up	0
rip	0
out	0
all	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
these	0
[laughter-junipers]	1
or	0
anything	0
that	0
requires	1
uh	0
more	0
care	0
than	0
i	0
am	0
willing	0
to	0
give	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
replace	0
it	0
with	0
hollies	1

is	0
that	1
i	0
am	1
very	0
liberal	1
politically	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
hardly	1
ever	1
have	0
anybody	0
that	0
wins	1
that	0
i	0
[laughter-vote]	0
[laughter-for]	1

by	0
liberal	1
um	0

liberal	0
politically	0
i'm	0

know	0
like	0
pretty	0
left	0

demo[crat]	0
democrat	0

i	0
don't	1
know	0
anything	0
about	0
politics	1

oh	0
you	0
don't	0

uh	0
what's	0
the	0
main	0
what's	0
the	0
main	0
difference	0
between	0
republicans	0
and	0
democrats	0

okay	0
well	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them_1	0
um	0
[de]pends	1
on	0
what	0
issue	0
you're	0
talking	0
about	1
but	1
democrats	0
are	0
on	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
issues	0
are	0
more	0
liberal	0
than	0
republicans	0
and	1
well	1
it	0
used	0
to	1
be	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	0
to	0
say	0
now	1
especially	0
after	0
desert	0
storm	1
but	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
back	1
in	0
the	0
eigh[ties]	1
times	1
when	0
uh	0
my	1
political	0
opinions	0
were	0
being	1
formed	0
like	0
in	0
viet[nam]	1
during	0
the	0
vietnam	0
war	0
and	0
stuff	1
the	0
republicans	0
were	1
more	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
they	0
called	0
hawks	1
which	0
is	1
more	1
like	1
aggressive	1
in	1
war	1
and	0
more	1
pro-war	1
and	0
pro-aggression	1
and	1

uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
um	0
the	0
democrats	0
were	0
the	0
doves	1
they	0
were	0
more	0
for	0
peace	1
and	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
how	0
much	0
that	0
holds	0
true	0
anymore	1
i	0
think	0
you	0

and	0
you	0
vote	0
for	0
the	0
democrats	1
or	0

usually	0

usually	0
are	0
su[pportive]	0
more	0
supportive	0
of	0
public	0
assistance	0
programs	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
and	0
programs	0
to	0
um	0
th[e]	0
the	0
big	0
republican	0
thing	1
is	0
that	0
they	1
don't	1
they	0
vote	0
for	0
less	0
government	1
they	0
want	0
less	0
government	0
involvement	1
in	0
society	1

uh-huh	0

so	0
they're	1
more	0
less	0
apt	0
to	0
vote	1
in	1
you	0
know	0
more	1
aid	0
to	0
people	1
or	0
more	1
m[ore]	1
uh	0
they're	0
less	0
apt	0
to	0
vote	0
in	1
programs	0
that	0
involve	0
the	0
government	1
running	0
things	1

huh	0

[laughter-okay]	0

yeah	0
that's	0
okay	0

well	1
well	1
that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
like	0
i	0
didn't	0
know	1
what	0
the	0
difference	0
between	0
dukakis	0
and	0
bush	0
was	1

um-hum	0

you	0
know	1
i	0
didn't	0

about	0
bush	0
or	0
dukakis	1

so	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
think	0
about	1
uh	0
what	0

think	0
about	0
what	0
you	0
see	0
on	0
tv	1
about	0
them_1	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
news	1
or	1
on	0
the	1

do	0
you	0
kind	0
of	0
just	0

okay	0
i	0
don't	0
remember	0
anything	0
about	0
dukakis	1

you	0
don't	0

but	1
well	0
they're	0
all	0
saying	0
that	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
you	0
know	1
whatever	0
is	0
best	1
for	0
their	0
campaign	0
anyway	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
if	0
they	0
had	0
some	0
kind	0
of	0
public	0
programs	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
just	0
go	0
out	1
and	0

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
like	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
school	0
they	0
didn't	0
teach	0
you	0
about	1
demo[crats]	1
uh	0
the	0
government	1
not	0
really	1

right	0

you	0
didn't	0
get	0
any	0
government	0
classes	1

hum-um	0

yeah	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	1
too	0
because	0
before	1
they	0
used	0
to	0
have	1
um	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
seems	0
like	0
the	0
stuff	0
that	0
they	0
put	0
out	0
now	1
it	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
doesn't	0
just	0
seem	0
like	1
it	0
i	0
know	0
for	0
a	0
fact	0
that	0
the	1
any	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	1
that	0
if	0
you	1
wrote	0
and	0
asked	0
for	1
material	1
well	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
believe	1
in	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
believe	0
in	1
they	0
don't	0
take	0
any	0
stands	0
on	0
anything	1
they	0
kind	0
of	0
say	1
well	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
want	1
me	0
to	0
believe	0

yeah	0

or	0
they	0
word	1
it	0
so	0
that	0
it's	0
really	1
hard	0
to	0
tell	1
where	0
they're	0
standing	0
on	0
certain	0
issues	1

well	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
they're	0
yeah	0
i	0
know	0
how	0
they	0
do	0
it	1
it	0

um-hum	0

it	0
like	0
i[t]	0
with	0
the	0
abortion	0
issues	0
and	0
stuff	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
kind	0
of	0
take	0
a	0
stand	0
on	0
some	1
things	0
like	0
abortion	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
so	0
that's	0
kind	1
of	0
how	0
i	0
judge	1
there's	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
where	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	1
like	0
abortion	1
or	0
gun	0
control	1
or	0
let	0
me	0
see	0
i	0
try	0
to	0
look	1
at	0
what	1
if	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
newspaper	0
articles	1
or	0
the	1
i	0
don't	0
trust	0
tv	0
as	0
much	1
but	0
newspaper	0
articles	1
can	1
show	1
wheth[er]	0
how	0
they	0
voted	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
and	0
but	0
you	0
get	0
you	0
know	0
it	0

right	0

it	0
all	0
depends	0
again	1
on	0
whose	0
writing	1
it	0
and	0
who	0
they're	0
for	1
because	0
they	0
can	0
slant	0
that	0
too	1

right	0
and	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
poli[ticians]	0
the	0
politicians	0
i'm	0
the	0
also	0
the	0
politicians	1
put	0
out	0
what	0
makes	0
them_1	0
look	0
good	0
anyway	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
everybody's	1
got	1
you	0
know	1
stuff	0
they	0
don't	0
want	0
known	1

right	0
everybody's	0
got	0
a	0
secret	1
so	0

well	0
anyway	1
i'm	0
sorry	0
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	0
have	1
much	0
knowledge	1

well	0
that's	0
okay	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
um	0

i	0
don't	0
even	0
remember	0
this	0
being	0
on	0
there	1

i	0
mean	1
what	0
would	0
it	0
take	1
like	1
that	1
this	0
is	0
really	0
good	1
actually	1
tha[t]	0
for	1
to	0
talk	0
to	0
somebody	0
who	0
hasn't	0
voted	1
i	0
mean	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0

incentive	0

how	0
would	0

how	1
what	0
kind	0
of	1
stuff	0
would	0
they	1
would	0
you	0
like	0
them	0
to	0
do	1
so	0

that	1
you	0
would	0
know	0
more	0
about	0
it	1
like	0
send	0
stuff	0
in	0
the	0
mail	0
or	0
have	0
it	0
at	0
the	0
library	0
or	0

i	0
guess	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
good	0
now	0
i'm	0
sure	0
they've	0
got	0
it	0
at	0
the	0
library	1
you	1
know	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0
if	0
i	0
get	0
to	0
the	0
library	1
i've	0
got	0
two	0
babies	1
so	0
i	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0

or	0
do	0
you	0
just	0
not	1
do	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
it's	0
not	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
make	0
that	0
much	0
difference	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
vote	1
or	0

oh	0
i	0
know	0
if	0
enough	0
people	0
think	0
like	0
that	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
would	0
make	0
a	0
difference	0
if	0
people	0
stopped	0
thinking	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

yeah	0

um	0
well	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
they'll	0
vote	1
the	0
way	0
their	0
family	1
votes	0
you	0
know	1
if	0

uh-huh	0

if	0
since	0
you're	1
what	0
democrat	1
th[en]	1
then	1
like	0
your	0
kids	0
or	0
whatever	0
will	0
follow	0
you	1
and	0
just	0
vote	0
democrat	1
right	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

right	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0

well	0
not	0
in	0
my	0
[laughter-family]	0

no	0

we're	0
kind	1
of	0
really	0
independent	1

all	0
split	0

but	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
families	0
do	0
that	1
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
wives	0
feel	1
like	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
vote	0
the	0
way	0
that	0
their	0
husbands	0
vote	1

right	0

and	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
keeps	0
from	0
getting	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
issues	0
resolved	1
golly	0

i	0
lie	0
hm	0

but	0
well	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	1
did	0
understand	0
politics	1
i	0
probably	0
would	0
vote	0
more	1

um-hum	0

but	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
if	0
i	0
voted	0
for	0
bush	0
or	0
like	1
when	0
uh	0
gary	1
hart	0
was	0
running	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
women	0
would	0
have	0
voted	0
for	0
him	1
just	0
because	0
he	0
was	0
nicer	0
looking	1
not	0

hart	0

uh-huh	0

not	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
was	0
good	0
looking	0
but	0
he	0
was	0
young	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

and	0
then	1
i	0
didn't	0
think	0
that	0
was	0
right	1
because	0
he	0
may	0
have	0
been	0
a	1
good	0
president	0
or	0
whatever	1

um-hum	0

but	0
because	0
it	0
was	1
he	0
had	0
an	0
affair	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
it	1
just	0
threw	0
him	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
whole	1
running	0

yeah	0

and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
go	0
by	1
their	1
uh	0
personal	0
life	0
when	0
they	0
vote	1
and	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

which	0
i	0
guess	0
if	0
you	0
got	0
turmoil	0
in	0
your	1
personal	0
life	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
let	1
it	0
come	0
into	0
work	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
that	0
have	1
had	0

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
everybody	0
does	0
it	0
just	0
depends	0
on	0
how	0
well	0
you	0
can	0
hide	1
it	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i	0
that's	0
very	0
true	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
doesn't	0
really	0
have	0
that	0
much	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
um	0
unless	0
they've	0
done	0
something	0
really	0
horrible	1
you	0
know	1
or	0
something	0
real	0
abnormal	1

well	0

criminal	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that's	0
different	0
but	0

yeah	0
right	0

but	0
if	0
him	0
and	0
his	0
wife	0
weren't	0
getting	0
along	1
i	0

but	0
otherwise	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	1
what	0
is	1
what	0
effect	0
does	0
that	0
have	0
on	0
him	0
running	0
for	0
president	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1

yeah	0
yeah	0

it's	0
all	0
so	0
secretive	0
see	0
we	0
really	0
don't	0
see	1
the	0
true	0
person	1
anyway	0

that's	0
right	0

i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	0
having	0
a	0
big	0
effect	0
on	0
how	1
poorly	0
that	0
the	0
country's	0
being	0
run	1
is	0
that	1
um	0
the	1
the	0
election	1
the	0
people	0
that	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
elected	1
are	0
turning	0
it	0
into	0
a	0
popularity	0
contest	1
by	0
advertising	0
the	0
things	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
that	0
really	0
don't	0
have	0
anything	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
how	0
well	0
they	0
do	0
the	0
job	1

right	0

but	0
see	0
they're	0
trying	0
to	0
find	0
an	0
excuse	1
not	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
what	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
issues	0
that	0
people	0
really	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
about	1
because	1
on	0
those	0
issues	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
don't	0
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	0
then	1
maybe	0
somebody'll	0
vote	0
for	0
them_1	0
that	0
wouldn't	0
have	1
if	0
they	0
had	0
come	0
down	0
on	0
the	0
wrong	0
side	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
so	0

right	0

so	0
they	0
just	0
try	0
and	0
make	0
it	0
a	0
personal	0
thing	0
i	0
mean	0
if	0
you	0
remember	1
any	0
of	0
the	0
tv	0
commercials	1
from	0
the	0
last	0
presidential	0
campaign	1
they	0
all	0
had	1
uh	0
pictures	0
of	0
bush	0
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
walking	0
around	0
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
and	1
even	0
from	0
reagan	0
it	0
was	0
all	0
just	0
like	1
looks	0
like	0
a	0
mcdonald's	0
commercial	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	0

that's	0
[laughter-about]	0
what	0
it	0
looked	1
like	0

well	1
what	0
did	0
you	0
think	0
of	0
reagan	0
as	0
a	0
president	1

i	0
just	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
really	0
inept	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
he	0
did	0
anything	0
at	0
all	1
he	1
they	0
just	1
kind	0
of	0
sat	0
him	0
up	0
there	0
like	0
a	0
puppet	1
and	0
the	0
people	0
that	0
were	0

do	0
you	0
think	0
he	0
won	0
from	0
carter	1
because	0
of	0
the	1
um	0
the	1
hostages	0
that	0
were	0
held	1
at	0
that	0
time	1

well	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
was	1
part	0
of	0
it	1
i	0
think	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
the	0
the	0
economic	0
problems	0
that	0
the	0
country	0
was	0
having	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
the	0
the	0
recession	0
and	0
stuff	0
people	0

um-hum	0

people	0
just	0
had	0
a	0
picture	0
of	0
carter	0
as	0
not	0
being	0
real	0
capable	1
but	0
he	0
actually	0
all	0
right	0
[laughter-this]	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	0

i	0
thought	0
carter	0
was	0
good	0
too	1
and	0
that	0
was	0
yeah	0

did	0
you	0
i	0
always	0
liked	0
him	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
couldn't	0
get	0
over	0
the	0
fact	0
that	0
reagan	0
beat	0
him	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
i	0
just	0
couldn't	0
believe	0
that	0
he	0
got	0
voted	0
out	1

but	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
wasn't	0
well	0
let's	0
see	0
that's	0
been	0
about	0
ten	0
years	0
ago	0
right	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0

okay	0
so	0
i	0
was	0
only	0
fifteen	0
or	0
sixteen	1
but	0
i	0
remember	0
carter	0
and	0
i	0
liked	0
him	0

you	0
did	0
have	0
you	0
heard	0
stuff	0
about	0
him	0
lately	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
he's	0
doing	1

no	0
i	0
sure	0
don't	0

well	0
he	0
is	0
just	1
he	0
is	0
really	0
active	0
still	0
politically	1
he's	0
been	0
overseas	0
you	0
remember	0
when	0
he	0
was	0
in	0
office	1
he	0
did	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
stuff	1
for	0
the	0
middle	1
ea[st]	0
for	1
pe[ople]	0

anyway	1
what	0
are	0
your	1
what	1
are	1
your	0
first	0
comments	1
on	0
that	1
subject	1

uh	0
my	1
first	1
comments	1
on	0
the	0
budget	1
i	0
would	0
say	0
there	1
has	1

what	0
would	0
you	0
start	0
cutting	1
f[irst]	0
what	0
would	0
be	0
the	0
first	0
thing	0
you'd	0
cut	1
defense	1

surprisingly	1
no	1
i	0
would	1
i	0
would	0
cut	0
the	0
prison	0
systems	1
and	0
let	0
them	0
self-support	1

mean	1
private	0
enterprise	1

hm	1

have	0
private	0
enter[prise]	1
enterprise	1
do	1
it	0

you	1
mean	1
the	1
prisons	1

uh-huh	1
they're	0
already	0
talking	1
about	0
it	1
i	0
mean	1
they're	0
talking	1
about	0
um	0
having	1
it	0
uh	0
as	1
a	0
you	1
know	0
business	1
uh	0
to	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
to	0
so	1
the	1
you	0
know	1
the	0
government	1
doesn't	0
have	0
to	0
deal	1
with	0
it	0

i	0
hadn't	0
heard	1
that	0

but	0
uh	0
yeah	0
because	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
all	1
funded	1
either	0
state	1
or	0
federally	1
funded	1
so	1
or	0
uh	0
obvious[ly]	1
so	1

right	1

so	1
but	1
um	0
but	0
see	0
they're	1
they	0
don't	0
have	0
enough	1
um	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
there's	1
there's	0
not	0
enough	1
room	1
in	0
these	0
prisons	1
and	0
that	0
and	0
that	1
uh	0
to	0
continue	0
funding	1
it	0
they	0

but	1
to	0
me	1
well	0

they	0
think	0
they	0
need	1
to	0
maybe	0
have	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
private	1
you	1
know	0
business	1
private	0
enterprise	1
come	1
in	0
so	1

well	0
see	1
the	0
other	0
way	0
i'm	0
thinking	1
about	0
is	0
they	0
should	0
be	0
self-supporting	1
like	0
um	1
the	0
prisoners	0
make	1
license	1
plates	0
or	0
farm	1
or	0
small	0
industry	1
inside	0
the	0
prisons	1
anything	1
to	0
where	0
they	0
can	0
be	0
self-supporting	1
within	0
themselves	1
in	0
other	0
words	1
they're	0
in	0
there	0
for	0
a	1
purpose	1
put	0
them	1
to	0
work	1
rather	0
than	0
sitting	1
there	0

um-hum	1

it's	0
the	0
same	0
thing	0
like	1
the	0
whole	1
criminal	1
i	0
shouldn't	0
say	0
criminal	1
but	0
the	0
whole	0
police	0
department	0
of	0
the	0
united	0
states	1
i	0
feel	0
the	0
same	1
way	0
uh	0
someone	0
gets	0
picked	0
up	0
for	0
drunk	0
driving	1
he	0
should	0
put	0
enough	0
in	1
there	0
that	0
goes	0
back	0
into	0
paying	0
for	0
that	0
policeman	0
being	1
out	1
there	0

um-hum	1

so	0
it's	0
self	0
defen[se]	1
you	1
know	0
self-defense	0
on	0
that	0
point	1
um	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
my	0
defense	1
budget	1
uh	0
they're	0
cutting	0
it	0
back	0
now	1
what	0
twenty	0
five	0
percent	1
i	0
wouldn't	0
want	0
to	0
see	0
it	0
cut	0
any	0
more	0
than	0
that	1

yeah	1

but	0
again	1
i'd	0
like	0
to	0
see	0
something	1
on	0
the	0
other	1
end	0
back	0
into	0
education	1
but	0
not	1
in	0
the	0
education	0
we	0
have	0
today	1
so	1
i'm	1
lost	0
on	0
that	1
one	0
i	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
be	1
a	0
little	0
more	1
into	1
investigating	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
other	1
countries	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
and	1
their	0
educational	0
problems	1
and	0
to	0
come	0
up	0
with	0
something	1
a	0
little	0
better	0
than	0
what	0
we've	0
got	1

um-hum	1
yeah	1
its	0
tough	1
to	0
to	0
say	1
what	1
um	1
you	0
know	1
what	1
uh	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
this	1
that	0
good	1
or	0
bad	1
or	0
what	1
but	0
uh	0
i	0
was	0
just	0
talking	0
to	0
somebody	0
else	1
and	0
all	0
those	0
european	0
countries	1
they	0
pay	1
all	0
the	0
way	0
through	0
college	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
they	1
so	1
uh	0

well	0
not	0
so	0
much	0
pay	1
i'm	0
not	1
trying	0
to	0
see	0
the	0
government	0
put	0
out	0
any	0
more	1

no	1
yeah	1
i	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
saying	1
but	0
i'm	0
just	0
saying	0
that	0
even	0
the	0
differences	1
uh	0
is	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
some	0
countries	0
pay	1
for	0
students	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
through	0
college	1
and	0
etcetera	1
but	0
here	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
it's	0
just	0
up	0
to	0
high	1
school	0

yeah	0
but	0
see	1
we	0
don't	0
even	0
push	1
the	0
fact	1
to	0
the	0
high	0
school	0
kids	1
that	0
there's	0
other	1
means	1
of	0
education	0
out	0
there	0
rather	0
than	0
college	1
to	0
go	0
either	1
as	0
an	0
apprentice	1
which	0
they	1
they	0
do	1
in	0
other	0
countries	0
just	0
doing	1
this	0
which	0
i	0
think	1
would	1
bring	1
the	0
education	0
back	0
up	1
you	1
know	0
why	0

hum-um	1

why	0
not	0
an	0
apprentice	1
out	0
to	1
a	0
a	0
company	1
and	0
learn	0
from	0
down	0
on	0
the	0
bottom	1
as	0
a	1
wood	0
worker	1
or	1
you	1
know	0
just	0
a	0
technician	1
you	0
can	0
learn	0
on	0
the	0
job	1
which	0
of	0
course	0
again	1
which	1
m[ean]	0
would	0
mean	1
again	1
our	0

um-hum	1

our	0
education	0
budget	0
will	0
go	0
down	1
if	0
this	1
is	0
in	0
a	0
few	0
years	1
i	0
mean	1
it's	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
overnight	1

yeah	1

but	0
that	0
would	1
come	0
down	0

i	0
think	0
the	0
pro[gram]	1
you	1
know	0
that's	0
one	0
reason	1
uh	1
you	0
know	1
we	0
do	0
have	0
the	0
education	1
is	0
that	1
what	0
it	0
takes	1
for	0
these	0
companies	1
to	0
bring	0
somebody	0
on	0
board	1
uh	1
they're	0
not	1
willing	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
put	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
training	1
for	1
only	0
a	0
certain	0
amount	1
so	1

so	1
um	1
it's	1
you	0
know	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
the	0
technical	1
side	0
but	1
uh	0
even	0
like	1
one	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
biggest	1
things	0
now	0
is	0
like	0
paralegals	1
and	0
stuff	0
i	0
mean	0
they	1
they're	1
trying	0
to	0
get	0
more	0
people	0
into	0
that	1
field	0
but	0
they	0
can't	0
just	0
bring	1
somebody	0
in	0
without	0
even	0
having	1
gone	0
to	1
you	1
know	0
school	1
in	0
that	0
area	1
before	1
they	0
can	0
work	1
you	1
know	0
for	0
a	0
lawyer	1
as	0
a	0
paralegal	1

excuse	1
me	0
i	0
see	0
it	0
being	0
done	1
i	0
know	0
of	0
a	0
friend	1
that	0
works	0
for	0
my	1
lawyer	0
that	0
has	0
had	0
no	1
training	0
whatsoever	0
and	0
she's	0
training	1
her	0

um-hum	1
well	0
yeah	1
i	1
i'm	1
well	0
ye[ah]	0
i	1
you	1
know	0
i'm	0
assuming	0
that	0
it	0
can	0
be	0
done	1
uh	0
my	1
perspective	0
is	0
that	0
you	1
know	0
i've	1
been	1
with	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
big	0
companies	1
now	0
and	0
it's	0
like	1
they'd	1
are	0
unwilling	1
to	0
put	0
the	0
time	1
in	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
want	0
somebody	1
you	1
know	0
when	0
they	1
then	0
when	0
they	0
bring	0
them	0
off	1
bring	0
them	0
in	1
that	0
they	0
have	0
something	1
you	1
know	0
a	0
certain	0
amount	0
to	0
contribute	1
obviously	1
there's	0
uh	0
uh	0
you	1
know	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
to	0
learn	1
uh	0
after	0
that	1
but	1
but	1
uh	0
that's	0
true	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
businesses	1
are	0
small	0
you	1
know	0
small	1
businesses	0
that	0
could	0
uh	0
let	0
me	0
change	1
my	0
channel	0
i've	0
got	1
a	0
cordless	1
phone	0
let	0
me	0
see	0
if	0
that	1
clears	1
this	0
up	0
is	0
that	0
better	1

yes	1

okay	1

wow	1

an[d]	1
yeah	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
cordless	0
phone	1
and	0
all	0
of	0
a	0
sudden	1
we	0
had	0
a	0
bad	1
uh	0
frequency	1
there	0
or	0
something	1
so	1
we	0
had	0
some	0
interference	1
so	0
i	0
changed	1
that	0

yeah	1
it	0
sounded	0
you	0
were	0
calling	0
from	0
around	0
the	1
world	0
[laughter-somewhere]	1

anyway	1
so	1
um	0

we[ll]	1

but	0
uh	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
they	0
maybe	1
they	0
need	0
to	0
uh	0
help	1
promote	1
that	0
more	0
give	0
incentives	1
like	1
uh	0
if	0
they	0
do	1
bring	0
somebody	0
on	0
they	0
will	1
pay	0
some	0
of	0
their	0
costs	1
or	0
give	0
tax	1
breaks	0
or	0
whatever	1
it	0
is	0
you	0
know	1
for	0
them	1
to	0
train	0
people	0
you	1
know	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
programs	0
like	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
i	0

um-hum	1

i	0
don't	0
know	1
you	1
know	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0
options	1
they've	0
got	0

well	0
that's	0
something	1
about	0
what	0
germany's	1
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
doing	0
something	0
similar	0
to	0
that	0
right	0
now	1
and	1
uh	0
they	0
have	0
jobs	1
out	0
on	0
you	1
know	0
bulletin	1
boards	0
so	0
people	0
know	1
what	0
is	0
open	1
for	0
an	0
apprentices	1
in	0
different	0
fields	1
but	0
see	0
that	1
again	1
would	0
cut	0
some	0
of	0
our	0
budget	0
down	0
for	0
education	1
but	0
build	1
up	0
our	0
education	0
with	0
the	0
people	1
at	1
people	1
per	0
at	0
high	1
school	0
level	0
which	0
i	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	1
rather	0
than	0
so	1
many	0
kids	0
getting	0
out	0
of	0
school	0
they're	0

uh-huh	1

they're	0
they	0
go	0
on	0
the	0
unemployment	1
list	0
before	0
we	0
have	0
turn	0
around	1
because	0
they	0
don't	0
have	0
any	0
education	1

um-hum	1

i	0
don't	0
mean	0
college	1
and	0
i'm	1
for	0
college	0
but	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
that	0
don't	0
want	1
their	0
higher	1
education	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
quote	0
quote	0
college	1
is	0
concerned	0
they've	0
had	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	1
think	1
i	0
just	0
heard	0
something	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
it	0
was	0
like	0
only	1
it	0
was	0
either	0
sixty	1
percent	0
or	0
forty	1
percent	0
go	0
to	0
college	1
and	0
then	1
out	0
of	0
that	1
percentage	0
only	1
so	0
many	0
can	0
get	0
their	0
degree	1

um-hum	1

so	0
i	0
thought	0
that	0
was	0
interesting	1
but	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
most	0
people	0
i	0
knew	1
have	0
gone	1
and	0
got	0
their	0
degree	0
so	1

oh	0
yeah	1
but	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
them	0
out	0
there	0
that	0
haven't	1

yeah	1
well	1
i	0
ju[st]	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
uh	0
was	1
basic	1
in	0
a	0
you	0
know	0
middle	1
upper	0
middle	0
class	1
area	1
and	1

that's	1

and	1
yeah	0
so	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
that	1
demographic	1
area	0
there	0
you	0
know	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
them	1
do	1
go	0
on	1
and	1
they	0
go	0
to	0
college	1
etcetera	1

well	1
it	0
seems	0
to	0
me	1
that	0
kids	1
that	0
a[re]	0
get	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0
that	0
parents	0
have	0
gone	0
to	0
college	1
and	0
college	0
here	1
and	0
college	0
there	1
that	0
are	0
really	1
not	1
interested	0
in	0
going	1
to	0
college	0
and	0
forced	0
into	1
it	0
usually	0
are	0
your	0
drop	1
outs	0
where	0
if	0
they're	0
said	1
hey	1
it's	0
just	1
as	0
advisable	1
to	0
go	0
into	0
something	0
you	0
enjoy	1
and	0
you	0
like	1
because	0
you	0
can	0
get	1
just	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
being	1
a	0
journeyman	0
carpenter	1
or	0
an	0
electrician	1
or	0
plumber	1
or	0
anything	0
else	1
like	0
that	0
make	0
as	0
much	0
money	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
enjoy	1
it	0
more	0
they'll	0
make	1
a	0
lo[t]	0
happier	0
life	1
for	0
themselves	0

yeah	1

question	1
you	0
threw	0
that	0
question	0
on	0
me	1
about	0
the	0
deficit	1
put	0
it	0
on	0
your	1
shoe	0
now	0
what	0
would	0
you	0
do	1

well	1
as	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
deficit	1
that's	1
a	0
whole	0
nother	1
uh	1
my	0
perception	1
of	0
the	0
budget	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
government	1
and	0
they	0
have	0
so	0
much	0
to	0
spend	1
and	0
there's	0
not	0
enough	0
money	0
to	0
spread	0
around	1
but	0
the	0
deficit	1
basically	1
is	1
that	0
the	0
trade	1
surplus	0
between	0
the	0
other	0
countries	1
and	0
that	0
we	0
have	0
more	0
money	1
or	0
goo[ds]	1
you	0
know	1
more	0
money	0
going	0
out	1
and	0
too	0
many	0
goods	0
coming	0
into	0
this	0
country	1
you	0
know	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
part	0
of	0
that	0
problem	1
i	0
think	1
is	0
still	1
you	0
know	0
uh	0
like	0
japan	1
still	0
does	0
not	0
let	0
us	0
compete	1
fairly	1
in	0
their	0
country	1
and	1
and	0
obviously	1
the	1
the	0
demand	0
for	0
their	0
goods	1
is	0
quite	0
high	1
here	0
so	1
they	0
can	0
get	0
their	0
goods	1
in	0
here	0
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
start	0
even	0
that	0
out	1
we	0
need	0
to	0
continue	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
at	0
least	0
threaten	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
we're	0
going	0
to	0
give	0
them	0
higher	0
tariffs	1
etcetera	1
to	0
raise	1
their	0
prices	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
ours	1
but	1
um	0
it's	0
just	1
that	0
uh	0
they're	1
in	1
i	1
think	0
you're	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
find	1
that	0
just	0
because	0
the	0
united	1
states	0
you	1
know	0
there	0
is	0
such	0
a	0
demand	1
here	0
the	0
market	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
uh	0
uh	0
the	0
mon[ey]	1
you	0
know	0
money	1
being	0
spent	1
and	0
the	0
goods	0
flow	0
in	1
and	0
we	0
don't	0
sell	1
you	1
know	0
we	0
don't	1
uh	0
sell	0
products	0
abroad	1
as	0
much	0
as	0
we	0
bring	0
in	1
so	1

were	0
you	0
watching	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
news	1
stations	0
i	0
couldn't	0
even	0
tell	0
you	0
which	1
one	0
i	0
watched	0
but	0
they	0
had	0
on	0
there	1
where	0
the	1
the	0
output	1
from	0
the	0
united	0
states	0
was	0
basically	0
from	0
smaller	1
businesses	0
rather	0
than	0
the	0
larger	1
ones	0
are	0
exporting	1

hum-um	1

kind	1
of	1

they're	0
in	0
good	0
spots	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
have	0
an	0
automatic	1
i	0
can't	0
drive	0
a	0
standard	1

oh	0
really	1
i	0

yeah	1

i	0
have	0
a	0
standard	1

but	1
um	0
i	1
it's	1
and	1
it's	0
supposedly	1
real	0
reliable	1
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i've	0
ever	0
heard	0
about	1
hondas	1
is	0
that	0
the	0
breaks	1
go	0
out	0
first	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

i	0
hadn't	0
heard	0
that	1

yeah	0

what	0
did	0
you	0
have	1
before	0
you	0
bought	0
that	1

i	0
had	0
a	0
buick	0
regal	1

did	1
you	0

yeah	0

i	0
had	1
uh	0
mazda	0
rx	0
seven	0
before	0
that	1
and	0
that	0
was	1
the	1
worse	0
car	1
i've	0
ever	0
driven	0
in	0
my	0
life	1

the	1
buick	1
was	1
was	1
great	1
it	0
was	0
nine	0
years	0
old	1
and	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
still	1
going	0
strong	1
and	1

really	1

the	0
only	1
problems	1
i	0
had	0
had	0
with	0
it	1
in	0
nine	0
years	0
that	0
i	0
owned	1
it	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
replace	0
the	0
compressor	1
when	0
it	0
was	0
about	1
seven	0
years	0
old	1

really	1

and	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
only	1
major	0
problem	0
that	0
i	0
had	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
had	0
little	1
piddly	0
things	1
like	1
i	0
had	0
to	0
replace	0
the	0
muffler	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
had	0
replaced	0
the	0
tires	1
and	1
uh	0
seems	0
like	0
it	0
had	0
a	0
radiator	0
leak	0
once	1
but	0
i	0
never	0
had	0
any	1
major	1
anything	1
other	0
than	0
the	0
compressor	1

right	0

i	0
never	0
really	0
had	0
anything	0
major	0
with	0
my	0
mazda	1
but	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
standard	0
also	1
and	0
the	0
clutch	0
went	0
out	0
on	0
it	0
toward	0
the	0
end	1
i	0
had	0
it	0
five	0
years	1
and	1
the	0
last	1
year	0
or	0
last	0
two	0
years	1
it	0
seemed	0
to	0
go	0
out	1
really	1
easily	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
went	0
out	0
twice	1
in	0
two	0
years	1
and	0
that's	1
that's	0
a	0
lot	1
it	0
shouldn't	0
go	0
out	0
that	0
much	1

no	1
hm	0

and	1
so	0
i	0
went	0
ahead	0
and	0
bought	0
another	1
standard	1
when	0
i	0
bought	0
the	0
honda	1
but	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
i'm	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
that	0
again	1
i	0
think	0
i'm	0
going	0
back	0
to	0
automatic	0
now	1

well	1
i	0
never	1
w[ell]	1
well	0
i	0
kind	0
of	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	0
standard	1
but	1
i've	0
never	0
owned	0
one	1
so	0
i	0
had[n't]	1
i	0
don't	0
drive	0
one	0
a	0
lot	1

right	1

so	0
i	0
don't	1
f[eel]	0
feel	0
comfortable	0
in	0
traffic	0
with	0
it	1

right	1

and	1
for	0
everything	0
i've	0
heard	1
it's	0
a	0
lot	0
easier	0
to	0
sell	0
an	0
automatic	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1

and	1
and	0
resale	0
value	1
is	0
really	0
important	0
to	0
me	1

that's	0
true	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1
me	0
too	1
that's	0
why	0
i	0
got	0
the	0
honda	1

yeah	0

hondas	0
have	0
great	0
resale	1
value	0

yeah	0

the	0
mazda	1
definitely	0
did	0
not	1
not	0
at	0
[laughter-all]	1
they're	0
worse	0
than	0
american	1
cars	0
i	0
think	0
or	0
just	0
as	0
bad	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
resale	1
goes	0

i	0
did	0
pretty	0
well	0
with	0
my	1
uh	0
regal	1
because	0
it	0
was	0
in	0
really	0
good	0
shape	1
but	0
it	0
still	0
looked	0
real	0
nice	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
interior	1
was	0
still	0
really	0
nice	1
there	0
[what'n/wasn't]	0
cracks	1
all	0
over	0
the	0
dash	0
board	0
and	0
stuff	1
an[d]	1

right	1

and	0
it	0
had	0
some	1
some	0
nice	0
features	1
so	0
i	0
ended	0
up	0
okay	1
with	0
the	0
buick	1

good	1

and	0
i	0
anticipate	0
the	0
same	0
thing	0
with	0
the	0
honda	1
whenever	0
i	0
decide	0
to	0
sell	1
it	0
course	0
i	0
may	0
never	0
sell	1
it	0

[laughter-right]	1

i	0
may	0
drive	0
it	0
till	0
it's	0
dead	1
but	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
that's	0
what	0
i	0
did	0
with	0
the	0
mazda	1
drive	0
it	0
till	1
the	0
till	0
the	0
clutch	0
went	0
out	1
and	0
the	0
wheels	0
fell	0
off	1
[laughter-so]	1

yeah	0

[laughter-so]	1
probably	0
what	0
i'll	0
do	0
again	1

yeah	0

but	0
i	0
really	0
like	0
the	0
hondas	1
i	0
like	0
foreign	0
cars	1
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

i	1
looked	0
at	0
the	0
mitsubishi	0
galant	1
i	0
was	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
four	0
door	0
car	1
having	0
driven	1
the	0
rx	0
seven	0
so	0
long	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
small	1
and	0
it's	0
really	0
impractical	1
so	0
i	0
wanted	0
something	0
with	0
a	0
real	1
trunk	0
and	0
four	0
doors	1
something	0
easy	0
to	0
get	0
in	0
and	0
out	1
of	0
and	0
i	0
looked	0
at	0
the	0
galant	1
and	0
those	0
were	0
really	0
nice	1
and	0
you	0
can	1
get	0
them_1	0
for	0
a	0
great	0
price	1

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
found	0
it	1
hard	0
to	0
deal	0
with	1
the	1
dealership	0
i	0
was	1
going	1
through	0

oh	1

so	1
that's	0
how	0
i	1
ended	0
up	0
with	0
a	0
honda	1

i	0
wasn't	0
even	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
car	1
when	0
i	1
bought	0
this	0
car	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
thinking	0
about	0
buying	0
a	0
prelude	0
from	0
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	0
moving	1
to	0
new	0
york	0
or	0
something	1
so	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
gonna	0
sell	0
her	0
car	1
because_1	0
she	0
didn't	0
need	0
it	0
anymore	1
and	0
it	1
was	1
only	1
like	0
a	0
year	0
old	1
and	0
i	0
had	0
never	0
driven	1
uh	0
a	0
prelude	1
so	1
i	0
went	0
to	0
a	0
dealership	1
because	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
uh	0
the	0
same	0
year	1
and	0
same	0
model	0
of	0
prelude	1
on	0
their	0
used	0
car	0
lot	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
test	0
drove	1
it	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
just	0
fell	0
in	0
love	1
with	0
this	0
brand	0
new	1
white	1
prelude	1
you	0
know	1
two	0
liter	0
si	1
with	0
the	1
the	0
sun	0
roof	1
and	0
the	0
moon	0
roof	1
and	1

oh	1
yeah	0

they're	0
nice	1
i	0
think	1

and	1
i	1
i	0
bought	0
it	0
loaded	1

oh	1
yeah	0

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	0
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
loaded	1
i	1

i	0
mean	1

i	1
i	0
love	0
all	0
those	0
little	0
things	1
that	0
you	0
[laughter-don't]	0
need	1
but	0
they're	0
so	0
wonderful	1

yeah	0
i	1
went	0
there	1
looking	0
at	0
a	1
used	0
car	1
and	0
two	0
days	0
later	1
i	0
bought	0
this	0
car	1
i	1

i	0
felt	1
i	0
felt	0
like	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
worst	0
impulse	1
that	1
w[as]	0
that	0
was	0
the	0
largest	0
impulse	0
buy	1
i	0
had	0
ever	0
made	1
the	1

the	1
oth[er]	0
the	0
two	0
other	0
things	0
that	0
i've	0
bought	0
on	0
impulse	1
are	0
vcr	1
and	0
a	0
[laughter-washer]	0
and	0
dryer	1

i	0
would	0
[laughter-say]	1

i	0
go	0
for	0
the	0
big	0
stuff	1

yeah	0
i	0
noticed	1
mine	0
was	0
definitely	0
not	0
impulse	1
i	0
really	0
needed	0
a	0
new	0
car	1
mine	0
was	0
just	1
it's	0
getting	1
worn	1
out	0
i	0
guess	1
from	0
being	0
a	0
sports	0
car	1
i	0
drove	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
got	0
it	0
right	0
after	0
high	0
school	1
so	0
by	0
the	0
time	0
i	0
traded	1
it	0
in	0
it	0
was	0
[laughter-ready]	1

yeah	1
i	0
got	1
i	0
got	0
my	0
buick	0
as	0
a	0
high	0
school	0
graduation	0
gift	1

ready	0
to	0
[laughter-go]	1

did	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
i	0
guess	0
this	0
[what'n/wasn't]	0
really	1
an	0
impulse	1
i	0
mean	0
buying	1
it	0
right	0
then	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
right	1
quickly	0
was	0
kind	0
of	0
impulsive	1
but	0
i'd	0
been	0
thinking	0
about	0
buying	0
a	0
new	0
car	0
for	0
three	1
years	1
and	1
i	0
was	0
just	1
scared	1
to	0

right	1

i	0
was	0
scared	0
to	0
start	0
taking	0
on	0
payments	1
because	0
the	0
buick	0
was	0
long	0
since	0
paid	1
for	0

right	1
that's	0
same	0
with	0
me	1
would	0
you	0
ever	0
buy	0
a	0
used	0
car	1
for	0
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
yourself	1

buy	0
a	1
buy	1
buy	0
a	0
used	0
car	1

like	1

right	1

sure	1

i	1
i	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
buy	0
one	0
once	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
worry	0
about	1
who's	0
driven	1
them_1	0
and	0
what	0
they've	0
been	0
through	1
and	0
the	0
warranties	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
just	1

yeah	0

just	1
i	0
can't	0
seem	0
to	0
get	0
over	0
that	1
that	0
just	0
bothers	0
[laughter-me]	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
why	1

well	1
um	0
like	1
on	0
hondas	1
they	1
supposedly	1
the	0
maintenance	0
records	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
registered	1
with	0
honda	0
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
request	1
whatever	0
maintenance	0
records	1
exist	0
on	0
cars	1
and	1
you	0
can	0
have	0
them_1	0
checked	0
out	0
by	0
mechanics	1
and	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

mean	0
they	0
can't	0
stop	0
you	0
from	0
doing	1
it	0
so	1

hoping	0
that	0
they	0
do	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
honda	0
dealership	1
to	0
get	0
them_1	0
serviced	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

well	0
and	0
even	0
if	0
they	0
didn't	1
you	0
can	0
still	0
get	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
from	0
a	1
if	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
a	0
good	0
mechanic	1
to	0
check	0
it	0
over	0
real	0
carefully	1
and	0
check	0
the	0
blocks	0
and	0
everything	1

yeah	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

well	1
i	0
guess	0
that's	0
all	1

okay	1
well	0
i	0
enjoyed	0
talking	0
to	0
you	1

i	0
enjoyed	0
talking	0
to	0
you	1

bye-bye	1

bye-bye	1

well	1
anyway	1
i	1
uh	1
i	1
uh	0
oh	1

i	1
did	0
forget	0
to	0
ask	1
you	0

is	0
your	1
name	1
by	0
the	0
way	1

um	1
i'm	0
ann	1

oh	0

ann	1
hi	1
but	1
um	1
anyway	1
i	1
uh	0
lot	1
of	0
lot	1
of	0
s[tuff]	0
interesting	0
procedural	1
things	0
i	0
think	1
we	0
could	0
we	0
could	0
change	1
if	0
we're	0
going	1
to	0
talking	0
about	0
the	0
subject	1
to[night]	0
tonight	1
which	0
is	1
some	1
i	1
guess	0
criminal	0
courts	1
the	1

criminal	0
courts	1
yes	1

yeah	1
the	1
the	0
one	1
of	0
which	0
was	1
uh	0
something	1
something	1
that's	0
been	0
going	0
on	0
because	0
of	0
the	0
rodney	0
king	0
trial	1
here	0
in	0
town	1
and	0
that	1
is	0
uh	0
and	0
that	0
is	0
the	0
exclusion	1
of	0
jurors	1
because	1
of	0
or	0
in	0
spite	1
of	0
their	0
race	1
uh	0
ye[ah]	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1
well	1
the	1
the	1
uh	1
the	1
the	0
people	1
that	1
the	0
the	0
the	0
uh	0
the	0
jury	1
that's	0
trying	1
uh	0
the	0
officers	1
in	0
that	1
case	0
is	1
is	1
an	0
all	0
white	0
panel	1

right	1

and	1
there's	1
been	0
a	0
lot	0
made	1
in	1
the	1
local	0
papers	1
of	0
that	0
fact	1

how	0
is	1
it	0

i	0
can't	1
i'm	1
a	0
little	0
surprised	0
they	0
didn't	0
get	0
a	0
change	0
of	0
venue	1
on	0
that	1
one	1

they	0
have	1
they	0
have	1
they	0
moved	0
it	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
county	1
north	0
of	0
here	0

oh	1

um	1
it's	0
in	0
ventura	1
and	1
there's	0
there's	0
still	0
quite	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
publicity	1
obviously	1
and	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
debatable	1
whether	0
you	0
could	0
get	0
a	0
fair	0
trial	0
almost	0
anywhere	1
because	0
that	1
uh	0
that	1

well	0
that	0
videotape	1
was	0
just	0
horrible	1

yeah	1
it	0
was	0
everywhere	1

yeah	1

so	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
i	1
i	0
think	0
it	0
would	1
be	1
very	0
difficult	1
to	0
find	0
someone	0
uh	1
find	0
a	1
panel	1
that	0
would	0
be	0
not	0
have	0
seen	1
it	0
and	0
and	0
known	1
of	0
what	0
was	0
going	0
on	0

oh	0
i	0
agree	0
with	0
you	1
but	0
i	0
can't	0
imagine	1
that	0
they	0
would	0
do	0
an	0
all	1
white	1
jury	1
without	0
having	0
some	0
sort	1
of	0
of	1
discrimination	1
or	1
or	1
you	0
know	1
uh	0
appeal	1
on	1
not	1
having	0
a	0
jury	0
of	0
his	0
peers	1
and	0
all	0
of	1
that	0
kind	0
of	1
stuff	1

exactly	1
you	1
know	0
um	0
the	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i'm	0
kind	0
of	0
torn	1
on	0
this	0
issue	0
it's	0
like	1
they're	0
saying	1
well	1
on	0
the	0
one	1
hand	0
they're	0
not	1
he's	0
not	0
getting	0
a	0
jury	0
of	0
his	0
peers	1
which	1
is	0
in	0
some	1
ways	1
i	1
think	0
true	1
but	0
on	0
the	0
other	0
hand	1
is	1
it's	0
also	1
saying	0
that	1
white	1
jurors	0
are	0
not	1
going	0
to	1
are	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
convict	1

right	1

uh	0
you	1
know	0
they're	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
their	0
job	1
which	0
is	0
the	0
whole	1
the	0
whole	0
point	0
of	0
being	1
on	1
a	0
jury	0
is	0
to	0
convict	1
or	0
or	1
or	0
uh	0
let	0
go	0
based	1
on	0
whether	1
or	0
not	0
the	0
person	1
whether	0
or	1
not	0
the	0
evidence	1
says	1
that	0
there's	0
enough	0

exactly	1

based	0
on	0
fact	1
right	1

how	1
interesting	1
ooh	1
so	1
what's	0
the	0
prevailing	1
thought	1
within	0
the	0
community	1

um	1

i	1
mean	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
the	0
news	0
media's	0
gonna	0
make	1
of	0
it	0
but	1
what	0
about	0
the	0
community	1

they	1
well	1
i	0
guess	0
it	0
depends	0
on	0
who	1
you	0
talk	0
to	0
i	0
haven't	0
talked	1
to	0
uh	0
i	0
haven't	0
talked	0
to	0
a	0
whole	0
lot	0
of	0
black	1
people	0
on	0
it	0
but	0
i	0
i	0
rather	0
imagine	1
there's	0
there's	0
some	0
snickering	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	0
usually	0
fatalistic	1
oh	0
here	0
we	0
go	0
again	1
folks	1
kind	0
of	0
stuff	1

uh-huh	1

oh	0
my	1
goodness	1
that	1
can't	0
be	0
good	1
for	0
los	0
angeles	1
either	1

no	1
no	1
i	1
you	1
know	0
on	1
on	0
on	0
one	1
hand	0
y[ou]	0
on	0
the	0
one	1
hand	0
you	0
almost	0
hope	0
that	0
they	0
convict	1
them	0
because	1
it's	0
th[ey]	0
they	0
have	0
that	0
very	0
strong	1
piece	0
of	0
physical	0
evidence	1
showing	1
these	0
people	0
beating	0
the	0
heck	0
out	0
of	0
this	0
guy	0
um	0

oh	0
exactly	1

unfortunately	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
is	0
not	1
limited	1
to	0
uh	0
a	0
big	0
city	0
like	0
los	0
angeles	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
just	0
about	0
anywhere	1

um-hum	0

there	1

well	0

but	1
that's	0
that's	0
interesting	1

yeah	0
um	0

what	1
about	0
the	0
judge	1
who's	0
hearing	0
the	0
case	1
is	0
he	0
gonna	0
be	0
impartial	1
is	0
he	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
g[ood]	0
a	0
good	0
adjudicator	1

i	0
don't	0
know	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
and	0
again	1
there's	0
something	0
else	1
th[at]	0
you	0
know	0
there	1
was	0
a	0
uh	0
i[t]	0
something	0
else	1
along	0
those	0
lines	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
girl	1
out	0
here	1
named	0
latausha	0
harlins	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
this	1
this	0
got	1
this	0
got	0
as	0
much	0
notoriety	1
but	0
it's	0
rather	1
almost	0
as	0
infamous	0
here	1
as	0
it	0
was	1
as	0
it	0
was	1
with	0
uh	0
the	0
rodney	0
king	1
problem	0
um	0
girl	0
walked	0
into	0
a	0
korean	0
owned	0
store	1
and	0
uh	0
they	1
she	0
had	0
a	0
dispute	1
black	1
girl	0

uh-huh	1

she	1
she	0
had	1
some	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
dispute	0
over	0
some	0
orange	1
juice	0
with	1
the	0
with	0
the	0
owner	1
of	0
the	0
store	0
the	0
owner	1
of	0
the	0
store	0
popped	1
her	0

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
well	0
of	0
course	1
the	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
criminal	1
case	0
went	1
up	0
and	0
and	0
the	0
judge	1
gave	0
the	0
woman	0
who	0
shot	1
her	0
shot	1
the	0
girl	0
a	1
uh	0
uh	0
practically	1
a	0
suspended	1
sentence	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
was	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
she	0

oh	0
my	0
goodness	1

she	0
gave	0
her	0
no	1
time	0
in	0
jail	0
and	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
all	0
of	0
these	0
things	1
and	0
then	0
oh	0
there's	0
uh	0
we	1
have	0
these	0
we	0
have	0
people	0
wandering	1
around	0
to	0
with	0
petitions	1
trying	0
to	0
get	0
the	0
judge	1

to	0
get	0
that	0
judge	0
recalled	1
i	0
would	0
think	1

yeah	1
yeah	1

hm	1
that's	0
almost	0
when	1
you	0
kind	0
of	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
where	1
st[andardized]	0
standardized	1
sentences	1

yeah	1
it	0
would	0
make	1
it	0
would	0
make	0
life	0
easier	1

it	0
would	1
uh	0

yeah	1
but	1

uh	0
you	0

but	1

you	0
would	0
know	1
the	0
whole	0
world	0
would	0
know	1
what	0
you	0
were	0
facing	1
and	0
then	1
it's	0
a	0
matter	0
of	0
of	0
deciding	1
g[uilt]	0

okay	0
uh	0
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
know	0
crime	0
in	1
the	0
cities	1
i'm	0
sure	0
i[t]	1
like	1
in	1
yours	0
it's	1
pretty	1
pretty	0
bad	1
uh	1
probably	1
the	0
biggest	0
thing	0
we've	0
got	0
going	0
now	1
is	0
the	0
robberies	1
and	0
theft	1
and	1
probably	1
murder	1
are	1
the	0
two	0
top	1
ones	0
that	0
we	1
have	1
how	0

um-hum	0

how	0
about_1	0
you	0

uh	0
well	1
i	0
don't	0
actually	0
live	0
in	0
the	0
city	1
but	1
uh	1
i'd	1
probably	0
say	0
that's	1
roughly	0
right	1
i	0
mean	1
crimes	0
against	0
property	1
seem	0
to	0
outnumber	0
crimes	0
against	0
life	1
but	0
i	0
i	0
think	1
with	0
the	0
current	0
war	0
on	0
drugs	1
and	0
all	0
this	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	1
i'd	0
say	0
probably	0
the	1
police	0
department	0
would	0
claim	0
the	0
number	0
one	1
crimes	1
crimes	0
are	0
probably	0
solicitation	0
of	0
prostitution	1
um	0
and	1
sale	0
of	0
drugs	1

um-hum	0
proba[bly]	0
probably	0
right	0
if	0
you	0
look	1
at	0
it	0
from	0
that	0
stand	1
point	0

um-hum	0

what	1
uh	1
is	0
there	0
anything	0
that	0
uh	0
that	0
you	0
particularly	0
are	0
concerned	0
with	0
in	0
in	0
your	0
particular	0
area	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
security	0
and	0
that	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	0

uh	0
where	0
i	1
live	0
no	1
it's	0
it's	1
not	1
so	0
bad	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
can	1
basically	0
leave	0
my	1
front	0
door	0
unlocked	1
and	1
not	0
have	0
to	0
worry	1
about	0
it	0
um	0
but	0
i	0
do	0
have	0
friends	0
who	0
live	0
in	0
the	0
city	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
they	0
get	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fallout	0
from	0
this	1
war	0
on	0
drug	0
thing	1
um	0
just	1
because	0
there	1
are	1
like	0
crack	0
houses	1
you	1
know	1
on	0
their	0
street	0
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
this	1

um-hum	0
do	0
you	0
live	0
in	0
a	0
real	0
small	0
town	1
or	0
or	0
out	0
in	0
the	0
country	1

i	0
live	0
out	0
in	0
the	0
country	1
yeah	0

how	0
far	0
out	0
from	0
the	0
city	0
i	0
mean	0
do	0
you	0

i	0
am	0
about	0
fifteen	0
miles	0
out	1

about_1	1
fifteen	0
miles	0
i	0
live	0
in	0
a	0
little	0
suburb	1
uh	0
which	1
is	0
i	0
guess	0
from	0
dallas	1
is	0
twelve	1
miles	0
or	0
so	0

um-hum	0

but	1
it's	0
pretty	0
congested	1
we	0
are	1
considered	1
in	0
the	0
country	0
but	1

hm	0

but	1
it	1
doesn't	0
really	0
feel	0
like	0
you're	1
in	0
the	1
country	1

hm	0

our	0
major	0
crimes	1
in	0
our	0
immediate	1
town	1
uh	0
is	0
probably	1
robberies	0
house	1
robberies	1
and	0
very	0
few	0
instances	0
of	0
you	0
know	0
alcohol	0
drug	0
uh	0
reported	0

um-hum	0

however	0
i'm	0
sure	0
they're	0
there	1

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
right	0
now	1
our	0
neighborhood	0
is	0
running	0
about	1
uh	0
eighty	1
percent	0
of	0
the	0
homeowners	1
have	1
been	0
robbed	1
sometime	0
during	0
their	1
their	1
uh	0
existence	0
in	0
that	0
neighborhood	1

wow	0

that's	0
huge	0

and	1
since	0
that	0
time	1
everybody's	0
gotten	0
some	0
sort	1
of	0
burglar	1
system	1
or	0
you	1
know	0
uh	0
burglar	1
alarms	1
uh	0
and	1
including	0
the	0
out	1
uh	0
the	0
outer	0
perimeter	0
type	1
uh	1
devices	1
the	1
sensors	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

it's	0
cut	1
back	1
you	0
know	1
considerably	1
but	0
it	0
it	0
just	0
shifts	0
it	0
from	1
our	0
neighborhood	1
to	1
another	0
neighborhood	1
to	1
another	0
neighborhood	1
so	1
it	0
still	1
uh	0
remains	0
city	1
wide	0
pretty	0
pretty	0
high	1

are	0
they	1
are	0
there	0
any	0
theories	0
on	0
why	0
this	0
is	0
happening	1

uh	0
i	0
would	0
say	0
the	0
majority	1
of	1
it's	1
happening	0
during	0
the	0
day	1
uh	1
between	1
probably	0
ten	1
in	0
the	1
morning	1
and	0
three	0
in	0
the	1
afternoon	1

um-hum	0

most	1

but	0
why	0
why	0
is	0
it	0
happening	0

well	0
most	0
families	0
most	0
families	0
they	0
are	0
young	1
and	0
both	0
people	0
are	1
working	0

um-hum	0

so	0
they're	0
happening	0
during	1
the	1
hours	1
they're	0
gone	0
from	0
work	1

um-hum	0

uh	0
so	1
uh	0
i	0
would	0
say	0
that's	0
probably	0
their	0
prime	0
motivation	1
they'll	1
s[talk]	0
they'll	0
stalk	0
your	0
house	1
and	0
uh	0
look	0
at	0
your	0
pattern	1
and	1
then	1
go	0
from	0
there	1

so	0
they're	0
professionals	0

um	0
they	0
classify	0
most	0
of	0
them_1	0
as	0
professionals	1

hm	0

uh	0
you	0
get	0
a	0
few	0
of	0
them_1	0
that	0
are	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
sloppier	1
uh	0
just	0
taking	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
just	0
junk	0
items	1
that	0
they	1
they	0
can	0
just	0
get	1
you	0
know	0
ten	0
to	0
twenty	0
bucks	0
for	0
real	0
quick	1

um-hum	0

probably	1
the	0
biggest	1
items	1
that	1
uh	0
that	0
you	0
get	0
in	0
our	0
neighborhood	1
or	0
would	1
be	1
the	0
high	0
classed	0
automobiles	1
mercedes	1
volvos	1
things	0
that	0
they	0
can	0
get	1
you	0
know	0
big	0
dollars	0
for	1
uh	0
jewelry	1
are	1
the	0
major	0
targets	1
guns	0

um-hum	0

guns	0
that	0
sort	1
of	0
stuff	0

hm	0

very	0
few	1
you	0
know	0
penny	0
penny	0
ante	1
stuff	0

well	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
can	0
be	0
done	1
to	0
reduce	1
that	0
sort	0
of	0
crime	1

well	0
uh	0
the	0
police	0
force	0
for	0
one	0
i	0
think	0
they	0
could	1
uh	0
definitely	0
add	0
to	0
the	0
police	0
force	1
and	0
the	0
type	0
equipment	0
that	0
they	0
use	1
uh	0
it's	0
oh	0
right	0
now	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
we're	1
about	1
thirty	0
thousand	0
people	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
eight	1
officers	0
that	0
patrol	1
for	0
thirty	1
for	0
that	0
amount	0
of	0
people	1
which	0
is	1
not	0
very	0
many	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

right	0

and	0

but	0
that	0
mean	0
that's	0
gonna	0
tend	0
to	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
seems	0
to	0
me	0
that	0
sort	0
of	0
approach	1
will	0
tend	0
to	0
simply	0
make	1
the	0
cost	0
of	0
committing	0
the	0
crime	0
slightly	0
higher	1
in	0
other	0
words	0
you've	0
increased	0
the	0
probability	0
of	0
somebody	0
being	0
caught	0
a	0
little	0
bit	1
the	0
real	0
question	1
is	0
how	0
do	0
you	0
convince	0
people	0
not	0
to	0
commit	0
such	0
crimes	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	1

well	0
the	0
course	0
in	0
our	0
particular	0
state	1
uh	0
we	0
have	0
the	0
prison	0
overcrowding	0
whatever	1
so	0
they're	0
giving	0
the	0
early	0
release	1
uh	0

right	0
they're	0
doing	0
that	0
in	0
our	0
state	1
t[oo]	0

yeah	0
and	0
and	0
it's	0
i	0
think	0
what	0
they	0
need	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
stop	0
building	0
more	0
jails	1
and	0
start	0
giving	0
stiffer	0
sentences	1
uh	0
but	0
for	0
the	0

so	0
you	0
think	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
deterrent	1

that	0
would	0
be	1
certainly	0
be	0
a	0
deterrent	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
not	0
necessarily	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
give	0
in	0
to	0
their	0
uh	0
human	0
rights	0
desires	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
they're	0
overcrowded	0
just	0
keep	0
cramming	0
them_1	0
in	0
there	0
till	0
they	0
just	0
suffocate	0
uh	0

well	0
what	0
about	0
an	0
innocent	0
person	0
who	0
happens	0
to	0
have	0
been	0
found	0
guilty	0

uh	0
i	0
think	0
they'd	0
have	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
extra	0
measures	1
to	0
make	0
sure	0
a	0
person's	0
guilty	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
cases	1
course	0
i	0
i	0
know	0
you	0
can't	0
be	0
a	0
hundred	0
percent	0
foolproof	0

right	0

uh	0

so	0
you'd	1
you'd	0
rather	0
see	1
it	0
harder	0
to	0
convict	0
somebody	1

i'd	0
rather	0
see	1
it	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
harder	1
and	0
have	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	0
evidence	1
uh	0
to	0
convict	0
somebody	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
then	0
those	0
convicted	0
especially	0
of	0
you	0
know	0
murder	0
and	0
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
major	0
crimes	0
uh	0
to	0
reach	0
the	0
life	0
sentences	0
and	0
you	0
know	0
death	0
penalties	0
and	0
follow-through	0
with	0
that	0

um-hum	0

hm	0

uh	0
especially	0
you	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
case	0
of	0
murder	0

right	0

uh	0
i	0
know	0
in	0
my	1
case	0
i	1
ha[d]	0
my	0
wife	0
and	0
daughter	0
were	0
kidnapped	1
during	0
a	0
house	0
robbery	1
back	0
in	0
eighty	0
five	1

oh	0
wow	0

oh	0
my	0
goodness	0

and	1
we	0
caught	1
the	0
individuals	0
got	0
caught	1
we	0
uh	0
we	0
went	1
through	0
the	0
court	1
system	0
and	0
all	0
that	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
two	0
counts	0
of	0
kidnapping	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
forty	0
five	0
to	0
the	0
head	1
you	0
know	0
just	1
the	1
the	0
mental	0
anguish	1
and	0
the	0
whole	0
nine	0
yards	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
guy	0
only	0
got	0
five	0
years	1

um-hum	0

right	0

wow	0

and	1
you	0
know	0
he	0
was	0
out	0
within	1
two	0
months	0
because	0
of	0
the	0
parole	1
system	0
so	0
what	0
what	0

did	0
you	1
did	0
you	0
sue	0
him	0
under	0
the	0
civil	0
system	1

do	0
what	0
now	0

did	0
you	0
sue	1
him	0
under	0
the	0
civil	0
system	0

n[o]	0
no	0
i'm	0
not	0
real	0
familiar	0
with	0
that	0

well	0
you	0
probably	0
sue	0
him	0
for	0
mental	0
anguish	0
or	0
something	1
right	1
and	0
try	0
to	0
get	0
money	0
from	0
him	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0

well	1
the	0
insurance	1
companies	0
and	0
all	0
that	1
tried	1
to	0
tried	0
to	0
go	0
after	1
him	0
and	0
they	0
said	0
well	0
you	0
know	0
he	1
they're	1
he	0
has	0
no	0
job	1
he	0
has	0
nothing	0
there's	0
nothing	0
that	0
he	0
has	1
that	0
that	0
you	0
could	0
go	0
after	1

yeah	0
makes	0
you	0
wish	0
they	0
had	1
uh	0
still	0
had	0
indentured	0
servitude	0
for	0
this	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	1

yeah	0
uh	0
very	0
seldom	0

but	0
they	1
g[ive]	0
give	0
the	0
guy	0
a	0
job	0
in	0
prison	1
and	0
make	0
him	0
pay	0
his	0
damn	0
debt	1

yeah	0
they	0
don't	0
do	0
that	0
here	1
course	0
they	0
pay	0
them	0
but	0
they	0
don't	0
you	0
don't	0
you	0
or	0
the	0
insurance	1
companies	0
never	0
see	0
any	0
of	0
that	0
money	1

yeah	0
that's	0
too	0
bad	0

and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
and	0
they're	1
right	0
now	0
they're	0
reluctant	0
to	0
go	0
after	0
them_1	0
because	0
they're	1
you	0
know	1
they're	1
they're	0
repeat	1
offenders	1
they	1
uh	0
they've	0
been	0
in	0
jail	0
before	1
they've	0

um-hum	0
um-hum	0

they've	0
been	0
released	1
you	1
know	0
several	0
times	1
which	0
is	0
another	1
uh	0
deal	0
i	0
hate	0
to	0
see	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	1
you	0
know	1
basically	0
the	0
guy	0
commits	1
you	0
know	1
three	0
major	0
crimes	1
and	0
uh	0
and	0
car	0
theft	0
on	0
top	0
of	0
it	1
and	0
destroys	0
my	0
car	1
he	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
a	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

he	0
we're	0
out	1
you	0
know	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
fifteen	0
thousand	0
dollars	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
guy	0
gets	0
out	0
in	0
two	0
months	1
and	0

that's	0
awful	0

and	0
he	0
goes	0
out	0
and	0
commits	0
it	0
again	1
fact	0
he's	0
back	0
in	0
[laughter-jail]	1
now	0
so	0
what	0
what	0
uh	0

gives	0
you	0
sympathy	0
for	0
the	0
vigilantes	1

yeah	0
what	1
what	0
deterrent	0
does	0
he	0
really	0
have	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
in	0
our	1
in	0
our	0
particular	0
neighborhood	1
vigilantism	0
is	0
becoming	1
a	0
real	0
real	0
possibility	1

um-hum	0

uh	0
we've	0
had	0
a	0
couple	0
instances	0
where	0
break-ins	1
where	0
the	1
the	0
people	0
have	1
actually	1
you	0
know	1
shot	0
the	0
people	1

oh	0
my	0
god	0

and	0
uh	0
return	0
offenders	0
have	0
they've	0
actually	0
waited	1
for	0
them_1	0
where	0
they've	0
robbed	1
you	0
know	1
particular	0
neighborhood	1
they'll	0
rob	0
one	0
house	1
then	1
other	0
people	0
will	0
wait	0
up	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
wait	0
for	0
somebody	0
to	0
do	0
something	0
else	1
and	0
try	0
to	0
take	0
it	0
in	0
their	0
own	0
hands	1
course	0

right	0

course	0
it	0
doesn't	0
always	0
work	0
out	0
in	0
their	0
favor	1

right	0

but	0
uh	0
nevertheless	1
i	0
think	0
people	0
are	0
just	0
getting	0
fed	0
up	1
and	0
saying	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
can't	0
arrest	0
all	1
of	0
us	0
you	1

um-hum	0

you	1
can	0
you	0
know	1
you	0
can	0
get	0
some	1
of	0
us	0
you	0

i	0
mean	0

you	0
can't	0
get	0
all	1
of	0
us	0

mean	0
that	0

uh	0
and	0
we're	0
beginning	0
to	0
see	1
more	0
and	0
more	0
of	0
that	1

that	0
sounds	0
that's	0
a	0
deterrent	0
too	1
if	0
you	0
think	0
the	0
home	0
owner	0
might	0
be	0
armed	1
right	1
and	0
awake	1

yeah	0

hear	0
you	0
break	0
in	0
and	0
you're	0
gonna	0
get	0
shot	1

yeah	0
that's	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	0
certainly	1
a	0
a	0
possibility	1
an[d]	0
an[d]	0
we	0
have	1
had	0
a	0
a	0
few	0
cases	1
where	0
the	0
guy	0
has	0
broken	0
in	1
you	0
know	1
during	0
the	0
middle	0
of	0
the	0
night	1
and	0
gotten	0
himself	0
shot	0
to	0
death	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
it	0
helps	0
for	0
a	0
while	1

um-hum	0

but	0
then	0
just	0
another	0
different	0
set	0
of	0
people	0
come	0
in	1
and	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
people	0
are	0
transients	1
from	0
out	1
outside	0
of	0
the	0
state	1

hm	0

uh	0
i	0
would	0
say	0
probably	0
eighty	0
percent	0
of	0
them_1	0
that	0
are	0
caught	1
they're	0
from	0
places	0
like	0
up	0
in	0
oklahoma	1
and	1
louisiana	1
arkansas	1
you	0
know	0
across	1
the	0
the	0
border	1

wow	0

so	0
you	0
know	0
people	0
who	0
don't	1
readily	0
read	0
the	0
newspapers	0
in	0
our	0
town	0
or	0
whatever	1

um-hum	0

it's	0
not	0
many	0
from	0
the	0
local	0
communities	1

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
it's	0
a	0
problem	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
the	0
court	0
systems	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
more	0
accurate	1
in	0
in	0
stiffer	0
in	0
their	0
penalties	1

yeah	0

would	0
be	0
a	0
definite	0
deterrent	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
giving	0
the	0
uh	0
police	1
uh	0
agencies	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
jurisdiction	0
over	0
what	0
they	0
do	1
when	0
they	1
when	0
they	0
catch	0
these	0
people	1

yeah	0

um-hum	0
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	0
tend	0
to	0
agree	0
with	0
you	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
what	0
i	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	0
is	0
number	0
one	1
completely	0
getting	0
rid	0
of	0
these	0
victimless	0
crimes	1
um	0
there's	0
no	0
reason	0
to	0
enforce	0
those	0
and	0
spend	0
time	1
and	0
money	0
doing	1
it	0
and	1
and	0
worry	0
about	0
these	0
things	0
where	0
people	0
are	0
getting	0
hurt	1

right	0

and	1
i	0
think	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
big	0
things	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
is	0
to	0
increase	0
deterrence	1
is	1
um	0
if	0
someone	0
is	0
found	0
guilty	0
of	0
a	1
uh	0
felony	1
level	0
offense	1
they	0
lose	0
their	0
citizenship	1
and	0
they	0
lose	0
their	0
constitutional	0
rights	1

um-hum	0

you	1
know	0
and	0
just	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
things	1
that	0
we're	0
trying	0
to	0
worry	0
about	1
you	0
know	1
protecting	0
these	0
people	0
from	0
we	0
just	0
don't	0
protect	1
them_1	0

i	0
know	0
like	0
in	0
my	0
wife's	1
case	0
they	0
made	0
her	0
feel	0
like	0
the	0
criminal	1

i	0
know	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
ridicul[ous]	0

they	1
they	0
went	0
to	0
all	1
all	1

okay	0
um	1
i	0
guess	1
um	0
this	0
is	0
probably	1
really	0
a	0
good	1
subject	1
for	0
me	0
because	1
i	1
really	0
like	1
to	1
do	1
uh	1
hand	0
work	1
uh	0
mostly	1
i	0
do	1
needlepoint	0
i	0
guess	1

oh	1
really	0

but	0
um	0

what	1
kinds	0
of	0
things	1
have	0
you	1
done	1

um	0
well	0
i've	0
made	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
baby	0
gifts	0

aha	0

it	0
seem	0
like	0
that's	0
like	0
especially	0
lately	1
there's	0
been	0
so	0
many	1
babies	1
that	1
uh	1
bibs	0
and	0
blankets	0
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	0
wall	0
hangings	0
um	0

do	0
you	0
ever	0
keep	0
any	0
of	1
your	0
stuff	1

isn't	1
that	0
funny	1
no	0

i	0
do	0
crochet	1
and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
uh	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
very	0
little	0
of	0
my	0
own	0
stuff	1
and	0
and	0
it	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
embarrassing	0
people	0
say	0
let	0
me	0
see	0
some	0
of	0
your	0
work	1

oh	1
well	1
can	0
you	0
go	1
to	0
so	0
and	0

yeah	0
isn't	0
that	0
funny	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
do	1
have	0
one	0
thing	0
um	0
a	0
friend	1
of	0
mine	0
gave	0
me	0
a	0
clock	1
kit	0
and	0

ooh	0

and	0
i	1
i	1
needlepointed	1
the	0
the	0
face	1
and	1
i	0
uh	0
kept	0
that	1
because	0
she	0
gave	1
me	0
that	1
so	0

that	1
that	0
would	0
be	1
definitely	1
something	0
you'd	0
want	0
to	0
keep	0

oh	1
yeah	0
and	0
it's	0
real	0
neat	0

was	1
was	0
the	0
whole	0
face	0
done	0
or	0
just	0
the	0
numbers	0
uh	0
and	1
and	0
like	0
minute	0
marks	0

um	0
basically	0
the	0
the	0
whole	0
well	0
no	0
i	0
guess	0
the	0
minute	0
marks	0
but	0
the	0
minute	1
marks	0
are	0
done	0
they're	0
like	0
hearts	0

oh	0

and	0
then	1
the	0
at	1
the	0
numbers	1
they	1
they're	1
kind	0
of	0
outlined	0
and	0
stuff	1
it	1
it	1
was	0
quite	0
bit	0
of	1
work	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
too	0
i	0
really	0
like	0
doing	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
so	0

i	0
did	0
some	0
needlepoint	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
got	0

blank	1
but	0
it's	0
used	1
wi[th]	0
uh	0
with	0
yarn	1
and	1
it	0
usually	0
takes	1
long	1
stitches	0
over	0
two	1
or	0
three	0
openings	0
in	0
the	0
cloth	1

huh	0

and	1
you	0
weave	0
intricate	0
patterns	1
and	0
use	0
different	0
colors	1
like	0
it	0
could	0
be	0
a	0
flame	1
stitch	0
where	0
so	0
rather	0
than	0
drawing	0
a	0
picture	1
you're	0
making	0
a	0
design	1
like	0
a	0
geometric	1
or	1
whatever	1
and	1
it	0
was	0
used	0
quite	0
often	1
in	0
the	0
colonial	1
times	0
to	0
uh	0
uh	0
to	0
upholster	0
chairs	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1
as	0
well	0
as	0
the	0
crewel	1
um	0
embroidery	1
work	0
that	0
was	0
done	0
on	0
them	0

wow	0
well	0

did	1
you	0
what	0
kind	1
of	0
things	0

do	0

what	0
i	1
did	0
when	1
when	0
i	0
was	0
doing	1
that	0
was	0
mostly	0
pillows	0
you	0
know	0
for	0
sofas	0
and	0
so	0
forth	0
and	1
i	0
can't	0
find	0
one	0
that	0
i've	0
done	1

oh	0

it's	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
things	1
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	0
give	0
them	0
away	1
but	0
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
been	0
my	0
color	0
choice	1
or	0
multiple	0
moves	1
or	1
or	0
what	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
i	0
was	0
so	0
proud	1
of	0
them	0
when	0
i	0
got	0
them	0
finished	1
but	0
i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	0
where	0
they	0
are	1

what	0
did	0
you	0
call	0
that	0

bargello	0
it's	0
b	0
a	0
r	1
g	1
e	1
double	0
l	0
o	1

huh	0
that's	0
i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0
that	0
before	0
i've	0
probably	0
seen	1
it	0
though	0
i	0

i	0
suspect	0
you	0
i	0
suspect	0
you	0
have	0

i	0
mean	0
when	0
you	0
described	0
it	0

yeah	0
i	0
mean	1
when	0
you	0
described	1
it	0
it	0
sounded	1
like	0
something	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
would	0
be	1
around	1
i	0
guess	0
but	1
um	0
i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0
it	0
before	0
and	0
it's	0
really	0
interesting	0
um	0
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
decorated	0
baskets	1
and	0
stuff	0
before	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
but	0
i've	0
kind	0
of	0
gotten	0
out	0
of	0
that	1
i	0
use	0
to	0
do	0
a	0
lot	0
more	1
and	0
sell	1
at	0
craft	0
shows	0

me	0
too	0

really	0

yeah	0
that's	0
interesting	0

yeah	0
it	0
[laughter-is]	0

how	0
did	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
choose	0
this	0
subject	0
tonight	1
that's	0
funny	0
uh	0
uh	0
what	0
how	0
did	0
you	0
what	0
kinds	0
of	0
decorations	1
did	0
you	0
use	1
with	0
the	0
bas[kets]	1
how	0
were	0
you	0
decorating	0
the	0
baskets	1

oh	1
basically	0
bows	0
and	1
lace	0
uh	0
ribbons	0
um	0

um	0

um	0
i	1
really	0
wanted	0
to	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
so	0
many	0
of	0
them	0
now	1
have	0
the	0
ribbons	1
where	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
how	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
the	0
ribbons	0
they	0
make	0
them	0
they	0
like	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	1
to	0
explain	0
it	0
they	0
make	0
them	0
hard	0
you	0
know	0

like	0
fabric	0
that's	0
been	0
stiffened	0
in	0

yeah	0

yes	0

i've	1
never	0
done	0
that	0
and	0
those	0
are	0
so	1
neat	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
would	0
really	0
like	0
to	0
do	0
those	1
but	0
um	0

i've	0
seen	0
some	0
and	0
there	0
there	0
they	0
i	0
suspect	0
they're	0
fairly	0
simple	1
because	0
the	0
one	0
lady	0
i've	0
seen	1
i	0
know	0
that	0
does	1
it	0
i've	0
never	0
asked	0
her	0
any	0
questions	1
but	0
she	1
has	0
three	0
kids	0
all	1
under	0
the	0
age	0
of	0
like	0
six	1

and	1
and	0
they're	0
all	1
a	0
handful	1
so	0
it's	0
got	0
to	0
be	0
something	0
she	1
can	0
do	0
fairly	1
easily	0
and	0
fairly	1
quickly	0

oh	0
definitely	0
yeah	0

when	0
i	0
do	1
um	0
crochet	1
it's	0
it's	0
usually	1
the	0
the	0
lacy	1
victorian	1
type	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0
i	1
stiffen	0
those	1
with	0
a	0
a	0
glue	1
mixture	0
it's	0
like	0
white	1
glue	0
and	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
similar	0
to	0
that	1
that	0
the	0
fabric	0
is	0
dipped	1
in	0
and	0
then	1
um	0
allowed	0
to	0
dry	1
in	0
those	1
those	0
draping	0
bows	1
i	0
mean	0
those	0
draping	1
streamers	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0

oh	0

i	0
was	0
just	0
there's	0
bound	0
to	0
be	0
some	0
kind	0
of	0
fabric	1
stiffener	0
like	0
that	0
that's	0
very	0
similar	1
that's	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
melt	1
too	0
much	0
with	0
uh	0
uh	0
high	1
humidity	0
in	1
in	0
a	0
room	1

yeah	0

that's	1
i	0
think	0
that's	0
what	0
my	0
concern	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
wasn't	0
really	0
sure	1
and	0
how	1
they	0
would	0
how	0
they	0
would	0
last	1

do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
my	0
concern	0
is	1
how	0
will	0
i	0
dust	0
this	0
thing	1

you're	0
[laughter-right]	0
no	0

i'm	0
[laughter-terrible]	0

no	0
that's	0
true	0
[laughter-though]	1
that's	0
funny	0

so	0
many	0
of	0
my	0
crafts	0
well	0
right	0
now	1
i'm	0
looking	0
at	0
a	0
little	0
uh	0
uh	0
quilted	1
uh	0
uh	0
hanging	1
it's	1
like	0
it's	0
a	0
flag	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	0
wash	0
it	0
because	0
that	0
would	0
start	0
breaking	0
down	0
the	0
batting	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0
but	0
it's	0
such	0
a	0
dust	1
collector	0
to	0
be	0
out	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
most	0
of	0
my	0
things	0
are	1
dust	0
collectors	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
hate	0
to	0
dust	0

i	0
know	0

so	1
that's	0
the	0
first	0
thing	1
i	0
think	0
of	0
is	0
how	0
easy	0
would	0
this	0
thing	0
be	0
to	0
clean	1

that's	0
funny	0
no	0
i	0
just	0
um	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
have	0
really	1
have	0
gotten	0
out	0
of	0
it	0
i	0
don't	0
do	0
it	0
quite	0
as	0
much	1
as	0
i	0
used	1
to	1
um	1
i	0
guess	1
because	0
i	0
i	0
went	0
back	0
to	0
school	1
so	0
i	0
don't	0
have	0
as	0
much	0
time	1

oh	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
time	1

now	0
and	0
i	1
have	0
two	0
children	1
[laughter-also]	0
[laughter-so]	0

you	0
definitely	1
don't	0
have	0
[laughter-time]	0

it	0
keeps	0
me	0
very	0
busy	0
but	0
i	0
really	0
enjoy	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
do	0
it	0
when	0
i	0
get	0
the	0
chance	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	0
it's	0
so	0
relaxing	1
to	0
just	0
sit	1
and	0
but	0
once	0
i	0
get	0
started	0
i	0
can't	0
put	0
it	0
down	1
i	0
just	0

i	0
have	0
a	0
similar	1
problem	0
i've	0
got	0
to	0
have	0
time	1
or	0
i	0
don't	0
even	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
into	0
it	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
end	1
up	0
lots	0
of	0
time	0
not	0
doing	0
anything	0
at	0
all	1

i	0
know	0
i	0
started	0
a	0
project	1
it's	0
been	0
over	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
that	0
i	0
swore	1
i	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
finish	0
for	0
somebody	0
for	0
[laughter-christmas]	1
and	0

you	0
just	0
didn't	0
say	0
which	0
christmas	1
right	1

that's	0
what	0
i	0
keep	0
telling	0
this	0
[laughter-person]	1
well	0
i	0
didn't	0
tell	0
you	0
what	0
year	1

what	0
was	0
this	0
project	0

um	0
well	1
it's	0
a	0
it's	0
uh	0
cross	1
stitch	0
and	1
it's	0
a	0
picture	1
and	0
it's	0
a	0
wildlife	1
it	0
has	0
deer	1
and	0
trees	1
and	0
it's	0
really	0
beautiful	0
but	0
it's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
work	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
i've	1
i	0
have	1
worked	0
on	0
it	0
quite	0
a	1
bit	1
but	1
not	0
as	0
much	0
as	0
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
so	0
hard	1

now	0
this	0
is	1
this	0
is	0
done	0
in	0
the	0
needlepoint	1

uh-huh	0
uh	0
well	0
i	1
shouldn't	1
it's	1
counted	1
cross	0
stitch	0
actually	1
is	0
what	0
i'm	1
doing	0
and	0
so	0
it's	1
really	1
since	0
it's	0
counted	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
work	1

yes	0
yes	0
i	0
do	0
know	0
i	0

yep	0

i	0
have	0
done	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
that	1
but	0
i've	0
decided	1
that	0
that's	0
something	0
that	0
demands	1
my	0
time	1
my	1
my	0
to[tal]	1
my	0
total	1
attention	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
i've	0
got	0
to	0
have	1
total	1
almost	0
total	1
silence	0
i	0
can't	0
really	0
watch	1
television	0
if	0
the	0
pattern	0
is	0
very	0
intricate	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you'd	0
have	1
lots	0
of	0
shading	1
on	0
that	0
particular	0
piece	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

yep	0

it	0
is	0
not	1
does	0
not	0
sound	0
like	0
an	0
easy	0
one	0
to	0
finish	1

no	0
it	0
really	0
isn't	0
and	0
i	0
tell	0
you	0
really	1
i	0
could	0
just	0
kick	0
myself	1
for	0
even	0
starting	1
[laughter-it]	0
because	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
feeling	0
i'm	0
never	0
going	0
to	0
get	0
it	0
done	1
i'm	1
probably	0
going	1
to	0
hear	0
about	0
it	0
the	0
rest	1
of	0
[laughter-my]	0
[laughter-life]	1

oh	0
i'm	0
sure	0
you'll	0
get	0
it	0
done	0
but	0
it	0
just	0
maybe	0
not	0
on	0
the	0
original	0
obviously	0
not	0
on	0
the	0
original	0
time	0
schedule	0

no	0
that's	0
true	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
don't	1
know	0
when	1
i'm	0
ever	0
it	0
just	0
seems	0
like	0
there's	0
just	0
never	0
enough	0
time	1
to	0
to	0
pick	1
it	0
up	0
and	1
do	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
really	0
hard	1
but	0
i	0
really	0
do	0
en[joy]	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
i	0
really	0
enjoy	0
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
it's	0
just	0
hard	0

just	0
hard	0
finding	1
the	0
time	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
dedicated	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	1
many	0
other	0
things	0
that	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
done	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
meantime	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
so	0
many	0
baby	1
gifts	0
i've	0
made	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
bibs	1
and	0
wall	1
hangings	0
and	0
so	1
you	0
know	0
those	1
don't	0
take	0
much	0
time	0
at	0
all	1
so	0
it's	0
no	0
big	0
deal	0
for	0
me	0
to	0
pick	0
those	0
up	1
and	0
do	1
them	0

do	0
you	1
do	0
you	1
use	0
patterns	1
i	0
mean	0
like	0
a	0
book	1
of	0
patterns	0
or	0
do	0
you	0
go	0
out	0
an	0
buy	1
a	0
a	0
kit	1
like	1
for	0
a	0
bib	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

no	0
no	0
i	0
usually	0
just	0
buy	0
a	0
pattern	0
book	1
i	0
have	0
several	0
pattern	1
books	0
and	0
i	0
just	0
go	0
with	0
those	1

okay	0

and	1
then	0
i	0
buy	0
the	0
bibs	0
separate	1
usually	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
cheaper	0
in	1
the	0
long	1
run	0
and	0
then	0
i	0
just	1
use	0
whatever	0
colors	1
i	0
want	0
to	0
i	0
don't	0
usually	0
use	0
the	0
colors	0
they	0
tell	1
me	0
to	0

um	0

and	1
it	0
it	0
depends	0
on	0
what	0
it	0
is	1
you	0
know	0
but	0
some	1
things	0
especially	0
letters	1
if	1
they	0
suggest	1
certain	0
colors	1
for	0
letters	0
i	0
just	1
go	0
with	0
whatever	0
i	0
want	1
to	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
would	0
do	0
too	1

yeah	0
i	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

or	0
or	0
whatever	0
i	0
have	0
[laughter-that's]	0

there's	1
yeah	1
there's	1
a	0
a	0
few	0
designs	0
i	0
guess	0
i've	0
done	0
myself	1
but	0
not	0
very	0
many	1
real	0
simple	1
ones	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
do	0
i've	0
made	1
i	0
made	1
a	0
little	0
uh	0
uh	0
little	1
uh	0
little	0
thumb	0
print	1
and	0
made	0
it	0
a	0
bunny	1

ooh	0

it	0
was	0
really	0
easy	0
i	0
mean	0
just	1
just	0
did	0
a	0
thumb	0
print	1
you	0
know	1

what	0
with	0
ink	0

uh-huh	0

oh	0
okay	0

and	0
then	1
see	0
i	0
didn't	0
cross	1
stitch	0
the	0
actual	0
thumb	1
print	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
was	0
just	0
the	0
ink	1
and	0
then	0
i	0
made	1
the	0
ears	1
and	0
little	0
eyes	1
and	0
nose	1
and	0
mouth	1
that	0
was	0
so	0
simple	0
[laughter-and]	0

oh	0
that	0
sounds	0
really	0
neat	0

it	0
didn't	0
take	0
anything	0
at	0
all	1
and	0

did	0
you	0
do	1
did	0
you	0
use	1
like	0
a	0
stamp	0
pad	1
an	0
ink	1
okay	0

um-hum	0
and	0
then	0
i	0
just	0

okay	0
so	0
you	0
just	0

first	1

no	0
you	0
can	1
start	1

okay	1
um	0
one	0
of	1
the	0
things	0
they	1
talked	1
about	0
was	1
uh	1
did	0
we	1
di[d]	1
wha[t]	1
do	1
what	0
do	1
we	1
think	0
about	0
a	0
judge	0
making	0
the	0
decision	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
really	0
don't	0
agree	0
with	1
that	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
the	0
trial	0
by	0
jury	1
is	0
better	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
than	1
e[ven]	0
having	0
a	1
unanimous	0
decision	1
rather	0
than	0
to	0
have	0
one	1
person	0
be	0
responsible	1
i	0
don't	0
think	0
that	1
they	0
could	0
be	1
objective	0
in	0
every	0
case	1
every	1
time	0

right	1

y[ou]	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1

right	1
there's	1
there	1
th[is]	0
thi[s]	1
this	0
topic	0
is	0
kind	0
of	1
moot	1
um	1
there	1

yeah	1

there	1
there's	0
no	0
way	1
we	1
we	1
couldn't	0
survive	1
in	0
a	0
sy[stem]	0
in	1
a	0
in	1
a	0
juror	1
syst[em]	0
in	0
a	1
trial	1
system	0
without	0
a	0
jury	1

right	1

um	1
one	0
man	0
can	0
never	0
be	0
one	0
man	1
one	0
woman	1
can	0
never	1
be	0
objectionable	0
in	0
every	1
case	0

that's	0
it	1

um	1
every	0
person	0
has	0
their	0
opinions	1
and	0
that's	0
why	1
jury	1
selection	0
is	0
often	0
very	0
difficult	0
um	1

well	0
i	1
i	0
feel	0
the	0
other	1
thing	0
too	0
uh	0
they	0
were	0
saying	1
uh	1
you	0
know	0
what	0
new	0
ways	1
could	1
you	0
could	1
it	0
you	1
you	1
know	0
change	1
the	0
system	0
i	0
i	0
really	0
think	1
that	1
um	1
we	0
spend	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
time	1
uh	0
going	0
through	0
appeal	1
after	1
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
i	0

i	0
mean	0
i[f]	1
if	0
you	1
go	0
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
and	0
especially	1
if	0
a	0
person	0
has	1
confessed	1
if	0
they	0
have	1
been	1
caught	1
you	1
know	0
point	1
blank	1
in	0
the	0
crime	1
there's	0
uh	1
no	0
question	1
it's	0

right	1

it's	0
beyond	0
a	0
reasonable	0
doubt	1
you	0
all	0
these	0
things	1
i	1
mean	0
you	1
know	0
we've	1
gone	0
through	0
this	1
uh	0
over	0
and	0
over	1
again	0

right	1
they	0
shouldn't	0
allow	0
an	0
appeal	1

and	1
it	0
can	0
go	0
on	1
for	1
ten	1
twenty	1
years	0

yep	1

i	0
i	1
think	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
little	0
ridiculous	1

[laughter-um-hum]	1

i	0
think	0
the	0
only	0
people	0
who	1
benefit	0
from	0
that	0
are	0
the	0
lawyers	1

no	0
that's	0
right	1
i	0
work	0
for	0
a	0
law	0
firm	1
[laughter-i]	1
[laughter-ought]	0

i	1
i'm	0
serious	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
the	0
lawyers	1
have	0
caused	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	0
problems	1
tha[t]	1
ha[ppen]	0
that	0
exist	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
criminal	0
system	0
today	1
with	0
plea	1
bargaining	0

right	1

you	1
know	0
if	0
someone	1
is	1

well	0
plea	1
bar[gaining]	0
plea	0
bargaining	1
is	0
a	0
different	0
story	1

well	1

plea	0
bargaining	0
is	0
something	0
completely	0
different	1
that	1
that	1
actually	0
prevents	1
trials	0
or	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
speeds	1
them_1	0
up	0

well	0
i	0
know	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
but	0
i	0
think	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
all	0
of	0
the	0
whole	0
criminal	1
system	1
is	0
messed	0
up	1
in	0
in	0
that	0
regard	1
i	0
mean	0
you	0
know	1
people	1
who	0
commit	1
uh	0
crimes	0
that	0
they	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	1
it	0
works	0
exactly	1
but	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	0
lesser	0
sentences	1

right	1

and	0
i	0
understand	0
that	0
the	0
jails	0
are	0
full	0
of	0
people	1
you	0
know	1
uh	1
and	0
that	0
they	1
have	0
to	0
do	0
something	1

right	1

but	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
reason	0
they	0
are	1
full	0
is	0
because	1
they	0
know	1
that	0
they	0
can	0
get	0
away	1
with	0
it	0

hum	1

you	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
tha[t]	0
we	0
we	1
don't	0
have	1
um	0
well	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
states	0
don't	0
have	0
capital	0
punishment	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
they	0
should	1

we	1
do	1

i	0
and	0
i	1
think	0
if	0
a	1
person	1
is	0
guilty	0
of	0
taking	0
someone's	0
life	1
and	0
like	0
you	0
say	1
it's	0
it's	0
there's	0
no	1
doubt	0
whatsoever	0
like	0
drunk	0
drivers	1
that	0
kill	1
people	0
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
all	1

right	1

they	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	0
i	0
i	0
just	0
think	0
that	0
that's	1
they've	0
they've	0
taken	0
a	0
life	1
and	0
if	1
they	1
should	0
pay	1
for	0
it	0
with	0
their	0
life	1

right	1
when	0
you're	0
saying	1
as	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
the	0
appeal	1
um	0
procedure	0
is	0
concerned	1

yeah	1

we	0
just	0
have	0
the	0
case	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	0
you've	0
probably	0
heard	1
of	0
marion	0
berry	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
his	1
fi[nal]	1
his	0
last	0
appeal	1
was	1
was	0
denied	1
two	0
days	0
before	1
his	0
sentence	1
was	0
up	0

oh	0
really	1

so	1
i	0
mean	1
his	0
appeal	0
was	0
denied	1
and	0
two	0
days	0
later	0
he	1
got	0
out	0
of	0
jail	1
for	0
cocaine	0
possession	1

it	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	0
um	0
that	0
was	0
absurd	1
there	0
was	0
no	0
there	0
was	0
no	0
reason	0
the	0
appeal	0
process	0
should	0
have	0
dragged	1
on	0
that	0
long	0
for	1
a	0
six	0
month	0
sentence	1

i	1
know	0
that	1
the	0

uh-huh	1
an[d]	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
wha[t]	0
what	0
would	0
you	1
do	0
to	0
change	1
it	0
to	0
make	0
it	0
better	1

well	1
uh	0
the	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	0
can	0
i	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
the	1
the	0
appeal	1
procedure	0
is	0
the	0
only	0
thing	0
i	0
can	0
possibly	0
think	1
of	0
um	1
i	0
like	1
i	0
said	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
removing	1
of	0
the	0
jury	1
and	0
having	0
the	0
judge	1
sentence	0
that's	1
absurd	0
there's	0
no	0
way	0
that	0
could	0
work	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	0
don't	0
agree	0
with	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	1
but	1

imagine	0
the	0
guilt	1
that	0
person	1
would	0
have	0
i	0
mean	1
it	0
burned	0
out	1

oh	0
exactly	1

is	1
there's	1
no	0
possible	0
way	1
that	0
you	1
could	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
feel	0
good	1
about	0
yourself	0

exactly	1

right	1

if	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
do	0
something	1
like	0
that	0
day	0
after	0
day	1

no	0
one	0
would	0
want	0
the	0
job	1

no	1
rea[lly]	1
not	0
really	1

um	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
like	0
i	0
said	1
the	0
you	0
know	1
everyone	0
has	0
their	0
opinions	0
about	0
every	0
case	1

well	0
wou[ld]	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
people	0
should	0
have	0
a	0
trial	1
if	0
they're	0
caught	0
dead	1
to	0
rights	1
like	1

oh	0
yeah	0
i	0
i	0
feel	0
that	0
everyone	1
is	0
everyone	1
is	0
um	0
entitled	0
to	0
a	0
trial	0
by	0
jury	1
that	0
that	1
that	0
right	1
sh[ould]	0

i	1
mean	0
supposing	1
i	0
come	0
up	0
to	0
you	1
and	0
i	0
just	0
point	1
blank	1
kill	1
you	0

well	1
i	0
mean	1
were	0
there	0
witnesses	1

in	0
other	0
words	1
you're	0
saying	1
that	0
we	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
find	0
out	1
whether	0
it's	0
premeditated	1
or	1
what	0
the	0
circumstances	0
were	1

right	1

right	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
you	0
can't	1
remove	0
the	0
jury	0
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
case	0

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
you	0
could	0
have	0
fifty	0
people	1
in	0
audience	1
watching	1
a	0
murder	0
take	0
place	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
you	1
you'd	0
still	1
there's	0
still	0
mitigating	0
circumstances	1

well	0
it's	0
i	1
i	1
feel	0

okay	1
what	0
do	1
you	0
think	1
about	1
it	0

well	1
uh	1
the	1
roles	0
have	0
definitely	0
changed	1
in	1
the	0
last	0
generation	1
or	0
so	0

oh	0
yeah	1

um	1
i	1
i	0
think	0
a	1
lot	1
of	1
it	1
has	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
women	0
working	1

uh-huh	1
yeah	1
i	0
do	0
too	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
going	0
to	0
in	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
future	1
i	0
think	1
all	0
women	0
are	1
going	1
to	0
work	1

yeah	0

i	1
mean	1
they	0
may	0
let	0
you	1
off	0
for	0
a	1
day	1
or	0
two	0
to	0
have	1
your	0
baby	1
but	0
that	0
will	0
be	0
it	1

yeah	0

or	1
either	0
they'll	1
have	0
a	1
computer	0
at	1
home	1
and	0
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
where	1
you	0
can	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
just	0
continue	0
right	0
on	1
with	0
your	0
work	1

ye[ah]	0
yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
i[t]	0
it	1
really	0
is	1
coming	0
to	0
that	0
because	0
most	0
women	1
now	1
days	0
cannot	0
afford	1
the	0
time	1
that	0
they	0
could	0
take	0
off	1
unless	0
the	0
company	0
pays	1
them	0

right	1
right	0

they	0
can't	0
even	0
afford	1
to	0
take	0
off	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
have	0
children	1
it	0
seems	1
like	0

and	1
it	0
and	0
it	0
seems	1
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
kids	1
uh	1
that	0
you	0
are	1
you	0
know	0
society	0
has	1
decided	0
for	1
you	0
how	1
many	0
you	0
can	1
really	1
have	0
and	0
make	1
it	0

yeah	1

and	0
uh	0
because	0
if	0
you	0
have	1
you	1
know	0
two	1
well	0
if	0
you	0
go	0
to	0
work	1
you're	0
just	0
working	0
to	0
pay	1
for	0
day	1
care	0
two	0
or	0
three	1
you	0
know	0
um	0

right	1

now	0
i	0
was	0
real	0
lucky	1
because	0
my	0
husband	0
had	0
a	0
good	0
enough	0
job	1
where	0
when	0
my	0
kids	1
were	0
you	0
know	0
when	0
i	0
had	0
them	1
and	0
when	0
they	0
were	0
small	1
until	0
they	0
got	0
in	0
junior	1
high	1
school	0
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
got	0
in	0
junior	0
high	0
i	0
didn't	0
have	0
to	0
work	1

uh-huh	1

oh	1
that	0
is	1
good	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
didn't	1
work	0
i	0
i	0
needed	1
to	0
but	0
i	0
didn't	1

yeah	0
steve's	1
steve	0
has	0
a	0
sister	0
who	1
has	0
four	1
she	0
just	0
had	0
her	0
fourth	1
one	1
in	1
uh	0
march	1
and	1
she	0
doesn't	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
either	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
i	1
don['t]	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
people	0
do	0
it	0
with	0
one	1
you	1
know	1
um	1
obviously	0

let	0
me	1
tell	1
you	0
you	0
go	0
without	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
things	1
that	0
you	0
wou[ld]	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
obviously	0
we	1
don't	0
have	1
any	1
and	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
part	1
of	1
the	0
role	0
reversal	0
is	0
it's	0
okay	1
to	0
get	0
married	1
and	0
not	0
have	0
kids	1

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
think	1
for	0
society	1
for	0
such	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
said	0
well	1
you	0
know	1
you're	0
married	1
now	1
you	1
need	0
to	0
se[t]	0
have	0
have	0
your	0
family	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
it's	0
been	0
until	0
recently	1
that	0
that	0
they	0
had	0
decided	1
that	0
two	1
people	0
was	1
a	0
family	0

right	1
right	0

you	0
know	0
and	0

well	1
it's	1
getting	1
where	0
you	0
can't	0
hardly	0
afford	1
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
give	1
your	0
kids	1
any	0
kind	0
of	0
education	1
and	0
stuff	0
you	0
can't	0
hardly	0
afford	1
to	0
have	1
over	0
two	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
mean	0
it's	0
hard	0
with	1
two	1
now	0
we	1
uh	0
my	1
youngest	1
one	0
i	0
have	0
two	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
son	0
and	0
a	0
daughter	1
and	1
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
graduating	0
from	0
college	1
soon	0

oh	1

but	0
if	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
third	1
one	0
i	0
just	0
don't	0
know	0
where	0
it	0
would	0
come	1
from	0

[laughter-yeah]	0

because	1
i	0
work	0
now	1
i	0
work	0
full	0
time	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
it	0
when	0
you	0
put	0
them	0
through	0
college	1

loans	1
and	0
grants	1
and	0
scholarships	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
that	0
helps	0
out	1
but	0

cost	0
a	0
lot	1

oh	0

book	1
is	0
a	0
little	1
bitty	0
skinny	0
book	1

yeah	0

i	1
said	0
my	0
goodness	1
what	0
is	1
it	0
lined	0
in	0
gold	1
you	0
know	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
it	0
is	1
it's	0
getting	0
worse	1
and	0
if	0
i'd	0
of	0
probably	0
had	1
three	0
or	0
four	0
children	1
i	0
don't	0
see	1
how	0
we	0
could	0
have	0
made	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
without	1
me	0
working	0

but	0
that's	1
that's	0
probably	1
because	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
three	1
you	0
you	0
know	0
would	0
say	0
if	0
i'd	0
of	0
had	0
four	1
i	0
guess	0
it's	0
always	1
not	1
not	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
picture	1
one	0
more	1
but	0
in	0
essence	1
you	0
probably	0
would	0
have	0
worked	0
out	0
fine	1

right	1
but	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	0
to	0
work	1

yeah	1

if	0
i'd	0
of	0
had	0
that	1
many	0
i'd	0
of	0
had	0
to	0
work	1
in	0
order	0
for	0
my	0
kids	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
even	0
though	0
he	0
brings	0
in	0
a	0
real	0
good	0
living	1
and	0
everything	0
in	0
order	0
for	0
me	0
to	0
keep	0
up	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	1
to	0
work	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
getting	0
more	0
and	0
more	1
like	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
one	0
child	1
now	0
that's	0
it	1
you	0
know	0
then	0

then	0
you	0
go	0
to	1
work	1
and	0
you	1
work	1

yeah	0

because	1
if	0
you	1
have	0
two	0
or	0
three	0
kids	1
by	0
the	0
way	0
the	0
inflation's	1
going	0
i	0
think	0
a	0
woman's	1
always	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
an	0
accepted	0
thing	1
there	0
isn't	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
any	0
of	0
this	0
you	0
know	0
very	0
few	0
people	0
will	0
ever	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
that's	0
all	1
right	1
with	0
me	0
because	0
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	0
stay	0
home	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
i	0
think	0
i'm	0
just	0
part	1
of	0
tha[t]	0
the	0
new	0
stuff	1
that	0
is	0
just	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	1
think	1
i	0
would	0
just	0
go	1
nuts	1
sitting	0
at	1
home	1
all	0
day	0
long	1

well	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
can't	0
imagine	1
how	0
i	0
did	0
because	0
now	1
i	0
work	0
all	0
the	0
time	1

yeah	1

and	1
um	0
well	0
i	0
work	0
all	0
week	1
and	1
um	0
i	0
can't	0
imagine	1
how	0
i	0
stayed	0
home	1

yeah	0

you	1
know	0
i	0
think	0
to	0
myself	1
what	0
did	0
i	0
do	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
just	1
it	0
revolutionized	1
an	0
where	0
a	0
woman	1
thinks	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
you	0
know	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
my	0
daughter	1
there's	0
no	0
way	1
that	0
she	0
can	0
imagine	0
herself	0
married	1
at	0
the	0
age	0
that	0
she's	0
at	0
now	1
to	0
her	1
everything	1
is	0
you've	0
got	0
to	0
go	0
through	0
college	1
you've	0
got	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
then	0
when	0
everything's	1
set	0
up	0
then	1
you	0
look	0
for	0
somebody	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
spend	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
your	0
life	1
with	0
but	0
i	1
mean	0
it	0
is	0
so	0
far	0
down	0
the	0
road	1
where	0

right	1

where	0
now	1
when	0
i	0
graduated	0
high	1
school	0
the	0
thing	1

that's	1
you	0
did	1
that's	0
what	0
you	0
did	1
uh	1

uh-huh	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
got	0
married	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
had	0
a	0
family	1

i	1
mean	0
that's	0
just	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
was	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
that's	1
like	0
when	0
my	0
mo[m]	0
i	0
know	0
when	0
my	0
mother's	1
age	0
it	1
was	0
always	1
the	0
kids	1
and	0
the	0
family	1
and	0
everything	0
had	0
to	0
come	0
first	1
and	0
the	0
woman	0
stayed	0
home	0
and	0
took	0
care	1
of	0
them	0
an	0

i	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
like	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
is	1

yeah	0

it's	0
uh	0
being	1
see	0
we're	0
from	0
houston	1
and	0
so	0
it's	0
not	0
so	0
hard	1
for	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
you've	0
been	0
married	1
three	0
or	0
so	0
years	1
and	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
kids	1
well	0
it's	0
okay	1
no[t]	0
nobody	0
does	1
but	0

come	0
to	0
a	0
place	0
like	0
belton	1
and	1
th[ere]	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	0
kids	0
here	1

married	0
out	0
of	0
high	0
school	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	0

su[nday]	1
we're	0
the	0
only	0

who	0
are	0
in	0
their	0
forties	1
and	0
they	0
can't	1
have	0
children	0
who	0
don't	0
have	0
children	1
and	0
they	0
can't	0
imagine	1
why	0
we	0
would	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
children	1
and	0
i'm	0
going	1
well	1
you	0
know	1
there's	0
more	0
to	0
life	1
you	0
know	0
there's	1
life	0
in	0
there	1
that's	0

you	0
know	0
not	0
everybody	1
has	0
to	0
have	0
kids	1
and	0
i'd	0
rather	0
spend	0
the	0
time	0
with	0
my	0
husband	1
than	0
you	0
know	1
spending	0
time	1
here	0
it's	0
your	0
turn	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
that	1
now	1
even	1
whenever	0
i	1
was	0
coming	0
up	1
and	0
everything	0
and	0
we	1
got	0
married	0
right	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0
well	0
a	0
year	1
after	0
i	0
got	0
out	0
of	0
high	0
school	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
i	0
didn't	0
have	0
kids	1
for	0
four	0
and	0
a	0
half	0
years	1
but	0
that	0
was	0
because	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
work	1
and	1
i	0
wasn't	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
what	0
it	0
is	0
i'm	0
not	0
either	1

and	0
everybody	0
thought	1
oh	0
my	0
gosh	1
what	0
is	0
the	0
matter	1
with	0
her	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

they're	0
probably	1
going	0
oh	1
i	0
bet	0
she	0
can't	0
get	0
pregnant	1

right	1
i	1
mean	0
they	1
thought	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
terrible	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	0
when	0
i'd	0
tell	1
them	0
you	0
know	0
well	0
i'm	0
just	0
not	0
ready	1
for	0
children	0
yet	0
oh	1
but	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
better	1
you	0
better	0
just	0
get	0
ready	1
now	1

yeah	0

well	0
you	0
don't	0
just	1
get	0
ready	1
but	0
i	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
odd	1
because	0
as	0
a	0
general	0
rule	1
the	0
people	0
that	0
married	1
during	0
my	0
time	1
they	0
had	0
kids	0
within	0
a	0
year	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
just	0
was	0
not	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
get	1
out	0
and	0
work	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	0
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
travel	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
which	0
we	0
did	1
and	1
uh	0
kids	0
didn't	0
fit	0
in	1
right	0
then	0
but	0
it's	0
getting	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
like	0
that	1
where	0
there's	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
couples	1
and	1
really	1
if	0
you	1
don't	0
want	1
the	0
kids	0
then	1
it's	0
not	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
i	0
don't	0
care	0
what	0
anybody	1
tells	0
you	0

right	1

and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
the	0
attitude's	1
getting	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
because	1
that's	0
like	0
my	0
daughter	1
now	0
she	1
says	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
maybe	0
when	0
she's	0
thirty	1
she	0
might	1
want	0
a	0
child	0
then	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
even	0
though	0
i'd	0
like	0
to	0
have	0
grandchildren	1
i	0
can	0
see	0
her	0
point	1

yeah	1
steve's	0
mom	1
finally	0
uh	0
finally	1
s[aid]	0
you	0
know	1
said	1
that	0
that	0
god	0
will	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
us	0
when	0
it's	0
our	0
time	1

right	1

she	0
finally	1
admitted	1
you	0
know	0
she	0
finally	1
told	0
me	0
it's	0
okay	0
if	0
you	0
don't	1
but	0
it	0
took	0
every	0
nerve	0
in	0
her	0
body	1
to	0
say	1
that	0
because	0
she's	1
from	0
a	0
very	0
very	0
old	0
fashioned	1
family	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
she	1
stayed	0
home	0
and	0
raised	1
her	0
kids	0
and	0
and	0
she	0
expected	1
all	0
of	0
her	0
kids	1
to	1
do	1
that	0
too	1
and	0
their	0
wives	1
and	0
to	0
be	1
the	0
the	0
housewife	1
and	0
have	0
dinner	0
ready	0
by	0
five	1
and	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
be	0
there	0
at	0
every	0
beck	0
and	0
call	1
and	0
i	0
was	0
raised	0
totally	0
opposite	1
[laughter-how]	0
we	0
got	0
together	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
but	0
because	0
my	0
mother	0
had	0
six	0
girls	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
she	1
worked	0
too	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	0
and	0
i	0
saw	1
how	0
life	1
was	0
when	0
she	0
stayed	0
home	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
rough	1
it	0
was	0
hard	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
and	0
it	0
really	0
is	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
you	0
know	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	0
much	0
more	1
now	0
all	0
my	0
income	1
goes	1
for	0
things	0
like	0
luxuries	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
really	0
does	1
except	0
for	0
what	0
we	1
give	0
to	0
my	0
daughter	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
put	0
her	0
through	0
college	1
and	0
stuff	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
the	0
rest	1
of	0
it	0
we	0
just	0
buy	0
things	1
like	0
boats	1
or	1
we	0
go	0
on	0
trips	1
or	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
the	0
more	1
or	0
less	0
like	0
entertainment	1
stuff	0

right	1

but	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you've	0
earned	1
that	0
though	0

yeah	1
i	0
feel	0
like	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
because	1
well	1
we're	0
to	0
the	0
age	1
now	1
i'm	0
not	0
old	1
but	0
i'm	0
older	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
i	0
got	0
to	0
stay	0
home	0
with	0
my	0
kids	1
which	0
i	0
really	0
wanted	1
to	0
do	0
but	0
now	1
i	0
could	0
not	0
go	0
back	1
and	0
do	0
it	0

yeah	0

i	0
really	0
couldn't	1
i	0
don't	0
think	0
i	0
could	0
stay	0
home	1
all	1
the	0
time	0
and	0
do	0
nothing	1
and	0
i	0
mean	0
i	0
did	1
stuff	0
but	0
to	0
me	1
it	0
[laughter-feels]	0
[laughter-like]	0
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-must]	0
have	0
done	1
nothing	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
just	0
the	0
new	0
way	0
that	0
people	0
are	0
thinking	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	0
so	1

but	1
uh	0

i	0
think	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
neat	1
if	0
if	0
they	0
could	0
incorporate	1
into	0
small	1
and	0
large	1
businesses	0
both	1
a	0
built	1
in	0
day	0
cares	1
where	0
the	0
children	0
were	0
there	1
in	0
the	0
facility	1
but	0
not	1
necessarily	0
right	0
there	0
with	1
you	0

well	0
you	1
know	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
of	0
them	0
are	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it	0
is	1
up	0
there	0
where	0
you	1
are	0
but	0
where	0
i	1
am	0
the	0
just	0
like	0
all	0
the	0
hospitals	1
they're	0
getting	0
day	1
care	0

uh-huh	1

are	1
they	0

but	1
the	0
reason	0
they	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
this	0
was	0
because	0
so	0
many	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
so	0
many	0
women	1
could	0
not	0
afford	1
like	0
you	1
said	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
four	0
kids	1
or	0
even	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
two	1
kids	0
you	0
would	0
be	0
paying	1
all	0
your	0
salary	1
to	0
pay	0
for	0
those	0
two	0
kids	1
to	0
go	1

right	1

so	1
uh	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
of	0
our	0
hospitals	1
especially	0
over	0
here	1
are	0
getting	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
bigger	0
companies	1
but	0
it's	0
mainly	0
the	0
hospitals	1

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
the	0
ti	0
in	0
dallas	1
does	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
nobody	0
around	0
here	1
does	0
it	0
we're	1
it's	0
too	0
small	1
around	0
here	0

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

hello	1

hello	1

hi	1

this	0
is	1
lois	1

hi	1
this	0
is	0
lisa	1

and	1
um	1
i	0
called	1
you	0
know	1
from	0
that	0
the	1
the	1
ti	1
database	0
calling	0
instructions	1

um-hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
got	0
a	1
call	1
yesterday	1
too	1
this	0
is	1
a	1
different	0
subject	1
though	1

yeah	0
this	0
is	0
about	1
changes	1
in	0
women	1
in	0
the	1

um-hum	1

uh	0
there's	1
really	0
a	0
lot	1
isn't	1
[laughter-there]	1
[laughter-i]	1

yeah	1

[laughter-i]	1
[laughter-mean]	0
there	0
really	0
is	1

[i]t's	0
kind	0
of	0
an	0
easy	0
thing	1
to	0
talk	0
about	1

oh	1
i	1
guess	0
the	0
work	0
force	0
would	0
be	1
the	1
main	1
wouldn't	1
it	0

yeah	1
um	0
i	1
think	1
you	0
have	0
to	1
push	0
one	1
and	0

can	1
start	1
recording	1
it	0

okay	1

you	0
ready	0
now	1

okay	1
like	0
i	0
said	0
i	0
guess	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
the	0
work	1
force	1
you	0
know	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
changes	1
in	0
the	0
generations	1

yes	1
i	0
know	1
because_1	1
i	0
know	0
when	0
my	1
mother	1
was	1
a	1
you	1
know	1
going	0
into	0
the	0
work	0
force	1
there	0
wasn't	0
very	1
many	1
opportunities	1
for	0
her	1
i	0
guess	1
she's	0
in	0
her	0
late	1
forties	1
you	1
were	1
expected	0
to	0
stay	0
home	0
and	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
i've	0
never	0
faced	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	0
no	1
i	0
think	1
n[ow]	0
now	1
you	0
go	1
to	0
work	1
when	1
they're	1
six	0
weeks	0
old	1
you	1
know	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
you	0
stay	1
there	0
and	0
i	0
feel	1
like	0
the	0
next	0
generation	1
you'll	0
probably	0
just	0
work	0
right	0
along	0
with	0
your	0
husband	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
um-hum	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
definitely	0
gotten	0
better	1

oh	0
i	0
do	0
too	1
much	1
and	1
it's	0
just	0
gonna	0
get	1
better	1

um-hum	0

it	1
really	0
is	1

because_1	0
women	0
are	0
in	1
every	0
field	0
now	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
can't	0
think	0
of	0
a	0
field	1
that	0
they're	0
not	0
involved	0
in	1

oh	1
i	0
can't	0
either	1
not	0
a	0
one	1

i	0
know	0
at	0
least	0
in	0
the	0
medical	1
field	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
they've	0
come	0
out	0
with	0
a	0
lot	1
further	0
advances	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
female	1
medications	0
and	0
things	1
since	0
women	0
have	0
gotten	0
into	1
the	0
doctor	1
field	0

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
think	0
that	0
men	0
really	0
took	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
that	0
[laughter-sort]	0
[laughter-of]	0
[laughter-thing]	1

yeah	0
even	0
in	0
washington	1
you	0
know	0
there	0
seems	0
to	0
be	1
lot	0
more	0
women	0
involved	1

yeah	0

hopefully	1
the	0
next	0
generation	1
it	0
won't	0
even	0
be	0
an	0
issue	1
i	1
mean	0
people	0
will	0
just	1
look	0
at	0
you	0
as	0
a	0
person	1
and	0
not	0
as	1
a	1
man	0
or	0
a	1
woman	1
i	0

yes	1
yes	1

i	0
think	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
the	0
best	1
goal	1

oh	0
i	0
do	0
too	1
just	0
your	1
qualifications	1
and	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
it	1

uh-huh	0
exactly	1
not	0
what	0
color	0
you	0
are	1
how	0
old	0
you	0
are	1
what	1
if	0
your	0
male	0
or	0
female	1
that	0
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1
i	0
guess	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	1
an	0
ideal	1
world	0
though	0
huh	1

yeah	1
i	0
kind	0
of	0
think	0
maybe	0
in	1
time	1
that	1
you	0
know	1
you'll	0
go	0
by	0
social	0
security	0
numbers	1
you	0
know	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
that	0
way	1
they	0
can't	0
say	1
well	0
they	1
picked	0
the	0
male	0
over	0
a	0
female	1
or	0
female	0
over	0
a	0
male	1
you	0
know	1
you	1

exactly	1
or	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
look	1
or	0
the	0
way	1
you	0
you	1
know	0
your	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

your	0
age	1
or	0
anything	1
i	0
think	0
that'd	0
be	0
a	0
wonderful	0
way	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

i	0
do	0
too	1
just	0
go	0
by	0
your	0
social	0
security	0
number	1
and	0
then	0
look	0
at	0
your	0
qualifications	1
that	1
you	0
know	1
that	0
you	0
have	1

um-hum	0
and	0
then	1

and	0
if	0
you	0
get	0
it	1
you	0
know	1
then	1

um-hum	0
also	1
with	0
uh	0
women	0
in	0
the	0
work	0
force	1
they've	0
gotten	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
options	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
you	0
know	1
what's	0
it	0
called	1
job	0
sharing	1

um-hum	0

like	0
if	0
you	0
and	0
another	0
lady	0
were	0
to	0
share	0
the	0
same	0
full	1
time	0
job	0
or	1

oh	1
yeah	1

as	0
a	0
matter	0
of	0
fact	1
that's	0
what	0
i'm	0
doing	1

is	1
it	0

um-hum	0
it	0
sure	0
is	1

that	0
would	0
be	0
great	1

it	0
sure	0
is	1

or	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
women	0
i	0
know	0
now	1
and	0
my	1
uh	0
one	0
of	0
my	0
supervisors	1
when	0
she	0
went	0
on	1
loa	0
to	0
have	0
her	0
baby	1
we	0
hooked	0
up	1
a	0
a	0
a	0
terminal	1
at	0
her	0
house	1
and	1
sh[e]	0
you	0
know	1
we	0
could	0
send	0
her	0
messages	1
and	0
and	0
she	1
kept	0
in	0
touch	1
like	0
that	1
and	0
basically	1
just	0
worked	0
out	0
of	0
her	0
house	1
i	0

oh	0

i	0
would	0
just	0
take	0
her	0
the	0
actual	0
paperwork	0
once	1
uh	0
every	0
week	0
or	0
two	1
and	0
that	0
worked	0
out	0
great	1
too	1

yeah	1
yes	1
that	0
is	1

i	0
mean	1
that's	0
a	0
real	0
attractive	1
option	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
the	1
the	0
technology	1
for	1
it	0

um-hum	0

all	0
it	0
was	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
mean	1
she	0
just	0
used	0
a	0
phone	1
modem	1
and	1
she	1
was	0
like	1
she	0
was	0
sitting	0
in	0
the	0
office	1
so	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
real	0
nice	1
too	1
to	0
come	0
up	0
with	0
different	0
options	1
do	0
you	0
like	0
the	0
job	0
sharing	1

oh	1
i	0
do	1
i	0

do	0
you	1

i	0
really	0
do	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
great	1

do	0
you	0
work	0
like	0
half	0
days	1
or	0
half	0
weeks	1
or	1

great	1

we	0
just	1
share	0
off	0
like	0
that	1

uh-huh	0
do	0

get	0
the	0
full	0
benefits	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0
we	0
get	1
the	0
full	0
benefits	1

oh	1
that's	0
wonderful	1

but	0
we've	0
just	1
really	0
got	1
a	0
wonderful	1
system	0
that	1
we're	0
working	1
under	1

yeah	1
especially_1	0
with	0
children	1
and	0
so	0
many	0
things	0
going	0
on	1
that	0
would	0
be	0
great	1

yeah	1

it	0
really	0
is	1
and	0
that	0
way	0
we're	0
not	1
really	0
missing	1
anything	1
out	1
you	0
know	1
of	0
those	0
children	1
uh-huh	0

either	0
way	1
yeah	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
you	0
have	0
your	0
career	1
and	0
your	0
home	0
life	1
and	0
that'd	0
be	0
a	0
nice	1
way	0
to	1
especially_1	0
if	0
you	0
have	1
young	1
children	1

oh	0
it	0
is	1
it	0
is	1
well	0
both	0
of	0
ours	1
is	0
school	0
age	1
but	0
we	0
don't	1
want	0
to	0
miss	0
any	0
of	0
those	1
pta's	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
all	0
of	0
that	1
so	0

um-hum	0
oh	0
no	1
i	0
think	1
yeah	1
my	0
son's	0
just	0
in	0
day	0
care	1
but	0
even	0
that	1
they	0
have	1
extracurricular	0
activities	1
and	0
the	0
older	1
they	0
get	0
the	0
more	1
that	0
you're	1
involved	0
in	0
that	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0
yes	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
great	1
i	0
really	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	0
look	0
for	0
more	1
of	0
that	1
in	0
the	0
next	0
generation	1

i	0
do	0
too	1
especially	0
as	0
women	0
get	0
up	1
in	0
management	1
and	1
and	1
can	0
be	0
in	0
on	0
those	0
decision	0
making	1
you	0
know	1
when	0
that	1
subject	0
comes	0
up	1
they	0
can	0
say	0
yes	1
that	0
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1

yes	1
oh	0
i	0
do	0
too	1

plus	0
i	0
bet	0
it	0
cuts	1
cuts	0
down	0
on	0
your	0
absenteeism	1
because_1	0
you've	0
got	1
two	0
days	0
off	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
everything	1
so	0
you	0
don't	0
have	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
unless	0
you're	0
just	0
really	1
sick	1
or	0
the	0
child's	1
sick	0

most	0
time	0
now	1
you	0
know	1
it's	1
just	0
a	0
weekend	1
or	0
just	0
forget	1
it	0

um-hum	0
oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	0
to	0
plan	0
way	0
in	0
advance	1
because	0
or	1
what	0
i've	0
done	0
is	0
found	1
like	0
doctors'	0
and	0
dentists'	0
office	0
with	0
extended	0
hours	1

uh-huh	0

that's	0
been	0
real	0
helpful	0
too	1
like	0
my	0
doctor	0
stays	0
open	0
till	0
nine	0
in	0
the	0
evening	1
so	0
that's	0
real	0
helpful	1
so	0
you	0
don't	1
you	0
know	1
have	0
to	0
do	0
it	1
during	0
office	0
hours	1
run	0
out	0
on	0
your	0
lunch	0
hour	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
many	0
times	0
i've	0
done	0
that	0
to	0
do	0
[laughter-something]	1
post	0
office	1
or	0
the	0
bank	1
or	0
any	0
uh	0
kind	0
of	0
errand	1

to	0
do	1
[laughter-yeah]	0

so	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0
i	0
think	1
we've	0
really	0
come	0
a	0
long	0
ways	1
in	1
that	1
because	1

uh-huh	0
i	0
guess	0
i	0
take	0
it	0
for	0
granted	1
kind	1
of	0
because_1	0
i	0
just	1
it's	0
always	0
been	0
that	0
way	1

um-hum	0

but	0
i	0
know	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	0
can	0
remem[ber]	1
remember	0
back	0
growing	0
up	1
my	0
mother	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
was	1
she	1
always	1
worked	1
but	0
it	0
wasn't	0
that	0
easy	1
for	0
her	0
to	0
just	0
take	0
off	1

oh	0
no	1
i	0
can	0
remember	0
my	0
mother	0
getting	0
in	0
trouble	1
if	0
you	0
know	0
one	0
of	0
us	0
was	0
sick	1
and	0
i	0
know	0
she	0
probably	0
didn't	0
make	0
hardly	0
anything	1
you	0
know	1
compared	0
to	0
the	0
work	0
that	0
she	0
did	1

oh	0
yes	1
um-hum	0
where	1
oh	1
yeah	1

i	0
think	0
there's	0
still	0
some	0
discrimination	1
there	0
where	0
as	0
you	0
know	0
men	0
and	0
wor[k]	1
women	0
work	0
in	0
the	0
same	0
job	1
i	0
think	0
men	0
get	0
paid	0
more	1

oh	1
i	0
do	0
too	1

but	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
improving	1
it's	0
such	0
a	0
slow	0
process	1
it's	0
frustrating	1
but	0
mean	0
you	0
can	0
see	0
that	0
it's	0
wrong	1
and	0

yes	1
yes	0

and	0
you	0
just	0
wanna	0
make	0
it	0
right	1
but	1
at	0
least	0
the	0
wheels	0
are	0
moving	0
forward	1

they	0
really	0
are	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
getting	0
better	0
not	0
worse	1
well	1
i	0
should	0
probably	0
get	0
back	0
to	0
my	0
job	1

[laughter-i-]	0
[laughter-know]	0
[laughter-i]	0
know	0
the	0
feeling	1

call	0
again	1

okay	1
and	0
i	0
sure	0
will	1
and	0
bye-bye	1

okay	0
bye-bye	1

okay	1
um	1
yeah	1
one	0
year	1
public	1
service	1
for	1
everybody	1
is	0
that	0
that	1
was	1
it	0
right	1

right	1
uh	0
who	1
wants	0
to	1
start	0
this	0
one	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
i've	0
been	0
i've	0
been	0
sitting	0
here	1
thinking	1
here	0
because	1
it	0
was	0
you	0
know	1
took	1
a	1
couple	1
tries	0
before	0
i	1
found	1
somebody	1
well	0
you	0
know	0
i'm	0
like	0
i'm	0
not	0
really	1
sure	1
what	1
i	0
think	0
about	0
this	1
um	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	0
the	0
first	1
thing	0
is	0
the	1
oh	0
if	1
it's	1
going	0
to	0
be	1
mandatory	1
it's	0
got	0
to	0
be	0
mandatory	1
i	0
mean	0
everybody	1
not	1
just	0
like	0
you	0
know	0
poor	1
people	0
and	0
all	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
but	0
you	0
know	0
senators'	0
sons	1
and	0
all	1
that	1
stuff	1
too	1
i	0

right	1
right	0

i	0
mean	0
everybody's	0
got	1
to	0
do	1
it	1
um	0
i	0
don't	1
know	1
it'd	1
probably	1
be	1
it'd	1
probably	0
be	1
good	1
i	0
just	0
don't	0
know	1
if	1
you	0
know	0
if	1
i	1
was	0
eighteen	1
or	1
whatever	0
i'd	0
want	1
to	0
be	0
stuck	0
doing	1
it	0
for	0
a	0
year	0
or	0
whatever	0

i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
i	0
want	0
an	0
eighteen	1
year	0
old	0
to	0
make	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
decision	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	1
uh	1
that	0
that	0
doesn't	0
sound	1
right	0
um	1
i	0
guess	0
i	0
see	0
overall	0
beneficial	1
if	0
we're	0
if	0
we're	0
just	0
going	0
from	0
that	1
point	0
of	0
view	0

uh-huh	1

um	0
i	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
old	0
you	1
are	0
but	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
uh	1
in	1
high	0
school	1
was	0
uh	1
beginning	0
of	1
vietnam	1
and	1
so	1
forth	0
and	1
many	0
of	0
my	0
peers	0
were	0
being	0
drafted	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
i	0
could	0
see	1
that	0
many	0
of	0
them	0
had	1
conscientious	0
objections	0
to	0
war	1
or	1
whatever	1
but	1
i	1
i	0
felt	1
strongly	0
then	1
that	1
even	0
if	1
they	0
didn't	0
feel	0
like	1
they	0
could	0
kill	1
someone	1
or	0
go	1
into	1
a	0
military	0
situation	1
that	1
that	1
they	0
could	1
help	0
the	0
country	0
in	0
other	1
ways	1
be	1
it	0
cleaning	0
out	1
uh	0
lots	1
in	0
in	1
their	0
neighborhood	1
or	0
whatever	0
kind	0
of	0
community	1
or	0
public	0
service	1
might	0
be	0
available	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	0
guess	0
i	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
as	0
not	1
so	0
much	1
a	0
a	0
demand	1
but	0
but	0
a	0
privilege	1
it's	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	0
uh	0
it's	0
something	1
i[t's]	0

yeah	1
is	0
um	0

it's	0
since	1
since	0
we	0
live	0
here	0
and	0
we	0
all	0
benefit	1
rich	0
poor	1
or	0
in	0
between	1
uh	0
there	0
are	0
benefits	0
even	0
for	0
those	0
who	0
have	0
it	0
the	0
hardest	1
i	0
just	0
see	0
that	1
as	0
maybe	1
a	0
good	0
idea	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
mind	0
doing	0
it	0
at	0
forty	0
four	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
find	0
ways	1
to	0
to	0
turn	0
some	0
of	0
that	0
back	1
to	0
to	0
others	1
uh	0
and	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	0
can't	0
see	0
that	0
as	0
being	1
something	0
to	0
really	0
object	1
to	1

well	0
i	0
guess	0
it's	1
going	0
to	0
depend	1
on	0
how	1
i	0
mean	0
if	0
if	0
you're	0
talking	1
about	0
any	0
if	0
you're	0
talking	0
about	0
something	0
that's	0
like	0
a	0
full	0
time	1
you	0
know	1
one	0
year	0
full	0
time	1
you	0
know	0
this	0
is	0
what	0
you	0
do	1
you	0
know	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	1
and	0
and	0
fill	0
pot	0
holes	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
all	0
that	1
stuff	0
i	0
mean	0
i	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1

i	0
could	0
see	1
a	0
a	0
full	1
a	0
run	1
a	0
gamut	1
of	0
different	0
kinds	0
of	0
opportunities	1
things	0
that	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
that	0
wou[ld]	0
that	0
could	0
be	1
done	0
in	0
an	0
hour	1
or	0
two	0
uh	0
a	0
day	1
or	0
several	0
hours	0
of	0
the	0
week	0
like	0
a	0
half	0
of	0
a	0
day	0
on	0
saturday	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	0
in	0
addition	0
to	0
what	0
one	0
does	1
uh	0
besides	1
that	0

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
i	0
can't	0
imagine	1
what	0
kind	0
of	0
uh	0
uh	0
bureaucracies	1
we'd	0
get	0
into	0
and	0
expense	1
having	1
it	0
be	0
full	0
time	1
oh	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
this	0
camp	1
and	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
like	1
um	0
back	0
in	0
the	0
depression	1
the	0
ccc	0
the	0
the	0
construction	0
corps	1
that	0
went	0
out	0
and	0
did	1
things	0
that	0
was	0
great	1
it	0

yeah	1

it	0
was	0
needed	1
it	0
gave	1
folks	1
some	0
jobs	1
and	0
we	0
got	0
some	0
great	0
public	0
works	1
out	0
of	0
it	0
but	1
um	1
i	0
don't	0
see	0
that	0
as	0
being	0
necessary	1
now	0
i	0
can	0
see	1
it	0
being	0
done	1
uh	0
on	0
a	0
regular	0
schedule	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
everybody	0
has	0
to	0
put	0
in	0
so	0
many	0
hours	1
of	0
uh	0
public	0
service	1
in	0
a	0
given	0
time	1
perhaps	0

uh-huh	0

uh	0
i	0
i	0
guess	0
i	0
see	0
all	0
of	0
us	0
benefiting	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
don't	1
see	0
it	0
just	0
relegated	0
to	0
the	0
young	1
but	0
i	0
see	1
i	0
i	0
see	0
so	0
much	0
going	0
on	1
that	0
that's	0
bad	1
and	0
this	0
would	0
give	0
them	0
a	0
chance	1
to	0
have	0
some	0
positive	1
self	0
esteem	1
something	0

uh-huh	1

something	0
that	0
they	0
turn	0
back	1

well	0

and	0
also	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
you	0
feel	0
more	1
like	0
you	0
know	0
you're	1
actually	0
part	1
of	0
the	1
community	0
if	0
you've	0
done	1
something	0
in	0
it	0

that's	0
right	1

you	0
take	0
pride	1
in	0
that	0
and	0
and	0
get	1
some	0
some	0
positive	0
feedback	1
from	0
those	0
who	0
benefit	0
besides	1
yourself	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
see	0
it	0
being	0
most	0
beneficial	1
if	0
it's	0
in	0
the	0
neighborhood	1
where	0
or	0
or	0
at	0
least	0
the	0
area	0
where	0
the	0
person	0
lives	1
it	0

uh	0
definitely	1

it	0
may	1
not	0
be	0
the	0
same	0
neighborhood	1
but	0
the	0
same	0
city	0
or	0
county	1
because	0
then	1
you're	0
you're	0
coming	0
in	0
contact	1
with	0
it	0
it's	0
not	0
as	0
meaningful	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
minnesota	1
and	0
do	0
something	0
up	0
there	0
that	0
i'll	0
never	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
see	1
again	0
unless	0
i	0
happen	0
to	0
go	0
on	0
vacation	1
up	1
there	0

right	1

yeah	1

it's	0
so	0
it	0
almost	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
has	0
more	1
impact	1
for	0
the	0
individual	1
on	0
going	1

yeah	1

but	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
putting	0
that	0
into	0
work	1
i	1
don't	0
want	0
to	0
i	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
deal	1
with	0
the	0
with	0
the	0
heartache	1
of	0
first	0
of	0
all	0
getting	0
it	0
started	1
and	0
figuring	0
out	0
how	0
to	0
do	0
the	0
logistics	1
yeah	0

oh	0
uh	0
that	0
would	1
be	0
a	1
nightmare	1

and	0
just	0
i	0
mean	0
just	0
getting	1
getting	0
it	0
going	1

yeah	0

yeah	0

i	0
i	0
see	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
things	0
like	0
uh	0
scouting	1
uh	0
boys	0
clubs	0
girls	1
clubs	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
that	0
kind	1
of	0
get	0
into	0
that	0
citizenship	1
uh	0
the	0
uh	0
looking	0
after	0
the	0
environment	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
don't	0
see	0
uh	0
this	0
being	1
that	0
different	1
but	0
even	0
more	0
beneficial	1
because	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
everybody	1
participated	0
in	0
and	0
would	0
take	0
a	0
turn	1
in	0

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	0
have	0
kids	1

n[o]	0
uh	0
no	1
not	0
yet	0
about_1	0
six	0
months	1
we	0
will	0

oh	1
well	0
good	1
good	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
little	0
time	1
think	0
about	0
that	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	1
have	0
uh	0
when	0
i	0
was	0
teaching	1
school	0
i	0
saw	1
many	0
ki[ds]	0
so	0
many	0
kids	0
that	0
were	0
at	0
loose	0
ends	1
and	1
that	0
didn't	0
really	0
have	0
a	0
purpose	1
and	0
i	0
can	0
see	1
you	1
know	0
some	0
some	0
really	1
significant	0
things	1
coming	0
out	0
of	0
it	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
know	1
you've	0
got	0
to	0
get	0
past	0
that	1
that	0
grudge	0
attitude	0
that	0
many	0
have	1
but	0
that's	1
uh	0
tha[t]	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
part	0
of	0
selling	1
it	0
to	0
the	0
community	1
to	0

uh-huh	1

the	0
adults	1
ahead	1
of	0
them	0
that	0
probably	0
would	0
never	0
serve	1
and	0
and	0
to	0
each	0
succeeding	0
generation	1
there'd	0
definitely	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
major	1
pr	0
campaign	1
in	0
each	0
community	0
each	0
county	1
uh	0
parish	1
or	0
however	1
the	0
state	1
was	0
divided	0
up	0

uh-huh	1

hum	1
i	0
may	0
well	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
around	0
here	1
we	0
have	0
a	0
number	0
of	0
community	0
projects	1
that	0
folks	0
just	0
volunteer	0
for	1
boy	0
scout	0
troops	1
or	0
church	0
groups	1
or	0
civic	0
clubs	1
will	0
uh	0
police	1
a	0
uh	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
miles	0
of	0
the	0
highway	1
and	1
kee[p]	0
and	1
i	0
i've	0
seen	0
it	0
in	0
other	0
states	0
too	1
i	1

yeah	0
they	0
have	0
that	0
here	1
um	0

i	1
don't	0
know	0

um	1

they've	0
got	1
um	0
in	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
states	1
around	0
here	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
you	0
know	0
down	0
in	0
north	0
carolina	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
big	0
controversy	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
because_1	0
the	0
uh	1
the	0
local	0
chapter	0
of	0
the	0
kkk	1
wanted	0
to	0
uh	0
um	0
to	0
participate	1
in	0
it	0
and	0

and	0
uh	0
there	0
was	0
a	0

and	0
there	0
were	0
those	1
that	0
said	0
no	0
you	0
can't	0
do	1
that	0
i'm	0
sure	1

yeah	1
well	1
uh	0
it	0
was	0
it	0
was	0
interesting	1
because	0
that's	0
an	0
interesting	0
question	1
you	0
know	0
should	0

yeah	0

should	0
these	0
people	0
be	0
allowed	0
to	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
think	1
they	0
finally	0
decided	0
not	1
to	0
because	0
they	0
figured	1
that	0
stretch	0
of	0
highway	1
was	0
going	0
to	1
get	0
trashed	1

oh	1
and	0
i	0
hadn't	0
even	0
thought	1
about	0
that	0
uh	0
the	0
oth[er]	1
the	0
other	0
end	1
of	0
that	0
that	1
that's	0
an	0
interesting	1
uh	0
situation	1
i	0
hadn't	0
thought	1
of	0
that	0
we	0
had	0
visited	1
relatives	0
in	0
virginia	1
not	0
too	0
long	1
ago	0
and	0
i	0
thought	0
i	0
had	0
seen	1
when	0
we	0
were	0
traveling	0
around	0
the	0
state	1
some	0
similar	0
signs	1
up	0
that	0
indicated	1
that	0
certain	0
sections	0
were	0
being	0
policed	1
and	0
cleaned	0
up	1
and	0

yeah	0
i	0
think	0
virginia's	1
got	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
know	0
maryland	1
does	0
and	0
we	1
just	0
we	0
went	0
to	0
indianapolis	1
last	0
weekend	0
and	0
back	1
and	0
um	0
i'm	0
pretty	0
sure	0
i	0
saw	1
yeah	0
stuff	0
in	0
ohio	1
and	0
indi[ana]	0
indiana	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
pennsylvania	1
maybe	0
pennsylvania	1
i	0
don't	0
remember	0
for	0
sure	1
now	0

and	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
about	0
your	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1
but	0
uh	1
down	0
here	0
in	0
the	0
last	1
y[ear]	0
oh	0
year	0
plus	1
i	0
it	0
was	0
las[t]	1
beginning	0
with	0
last	0
year's	0
earth	0
day	1
there's	0
just	0
been	0
more	1
of	0
a	0
turn	0
toward	1
uh	0
environmental	0
concerns	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
e[ven]	0
i	0
work	0
for	0
texas	0
instruments	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
they	0
they've	0
started	1
some	0
recycling	0
campaigns	1
that	0
a	0
year	0
before	0
that	1
had	0
been	0
turned	0
down	1
because_1	0
they	0
said	0
well	0
it's	0
not	0
feasible	1
it's	0

uh-huh	1

it's	0
not	1
a	0
good	0
idea	0
and	1
i	0
see	0
that	1
as	0
being	0
i	1
i	0
see	0
that	1
as	0
being	0
a	0
a	0
a	0
change	1
um	0
it	0
for	0
the	0
positive	1
kind	0
of	0
along	0
the	0
same	1
line	0
as	0
as	0
as	0
the	0
mandatory	1
thing	0
it's	0

yeah	0
and	0
but	0
then	0
they	0
lost	0
too	0
much	0
business	1

it's	0
just	0
thing	1
a	0
part	0
of	0
everyone's	0
consciousness	1

uh-huh	1
well	1
the	0
thing	0
about	0
that	1
is	0
though	0
it's	0
got	1
a	0
i	0
mean	1
because	0
it	0
was	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
was	0
big	1
you	0
remember	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
early	0
seventies	1
and	0
all	0
that	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
just	0
went	0
out	0
of	0
vogue	1
and	1
i	0
i'm	0
worried	1
that	0
it	0
it	1
might	0
you	0
know	0
it'll	0
it	1
the	0
same	0
thing	0
will	0
happen	1
it's	0
like	0
you	0
know	0
environmentalism	0
was	0
really	0
big	1
for	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	0
and	0
then	0
people	0
like	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
i'd	0
rather	0
rather	0
spend	1
you	0
know	0
fifty	0
cents	0
less	1
on	0
uh	0
on	0
on	0
such	0
and	0
such	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
even	0
if	0
it's	0
not	0
environmentally	0
safe	0
who	0
cares	1
you	0
know	0

i'm	0
sure	0
the	0
pendulum	1
will	0
swing	0
the	0
other	0
way	1
uh	0
there	0
have	0
been	0
too	0
many	0
other	1
things	0
that	0
it's	0
done	1
that	0
for	0
just	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
look	0
at	0
history	1
at	0
all	0
you	0
see	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
we	1
go	0
from	0
one	0
side	0
to	0
the	0
other	1
on	0
just	0
about	0
any	0
subject	1
that	0
you	0
one	0
might	0
care	1
to	0
bring	0
up	1

yeah	0

but	1
it	0
is	0
comforting	1
to	0
me	0
to	0
see	1
uh	0
more	0
concern	1
about	0
some	0
of	0
these	0
things	0
that	0
that	0
cost	0
us	0
money	1
especially	0
when	0
we	0
have	0
dwindling	1
uh	0
resources	1
such	0
as	0
oil	1
that's	0
burning	1
out	0
of	0
control	1
in	0
[laughter-in]	0
the	0
persian	0
gulf	1
and	0
and	0
so	1
forth	0
just	0
just	0
every	0
little	0
bit	1
does	1
it	0
makes	0
me	0
feel	1
better	0
it	0
it	0
makes	0
me	0
feel	1
like	0
well	1
there	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
left	1
for	0
my	1
children	0
my	0
nieces	0
and	0
nephews	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0

well	0
yeah	1
uh	0
uh	1
well	0
wouldn't	0
it's	0
just	0
probably	0
a	0
good	0
thing	0
that	0
the	0
oil's	0
burning	1
and	0
may	0
may	1
make	0
some	0
people	0
realize	0
that	0
hey	1
you	0
know	0
this	0
stuff	0
runs	0
out	1

that's	0
that's	0
right	1
because	1

of	0
course	1
that's	0
probably	0
blasphemy	1
for	0
you	0
to	0
say	0
uh	0
coming	1
from	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
texas	1

uh	0
no	1
no	1
because	1
if	0
we	1
what	1
was	0
it	0
in	0
seventy	0
four	1
when	0
we	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
last	0
last	0
oil	0
crisis	1
an[d]	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
started	0
getting	0
smart	1
and	0
and	0
we	0
were	0
looking	0
all	0
these	0
alternative	0
sources	1
of	0
energy	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
as	0
soon	1
as	0
the	0
oil	0
prices	0
came	0
back	0
down	1
we	0
the	0
pendulum	0
swung	1
the	0
other	0
way	1

right	1

and	1
we	1
need	1
those	0

you	0
know	0

that	0
i	0
just	0
can't	1

the	0
i	0

see	0
on	0
the	1
tv's	1
from	1
you	1
know	0
in	1
washington	1
and	1
new	1
york	1
so	0
what	0
i	1
believe	1
the	0
people	1
want	0
the	0
subject	1
is	1
is	1
big	0
city	0
crime	1
which	1
is	0
something	1
that	0
i	0
don't	0
have	0
any	0
first	0
hand	0
experiences	1
about	0
but	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
concerns	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
few	1
ideas	0
of	0
um	0
how	0
to	0
combat	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
uh	0
ideally	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
need	0
money	1
to	0
do	0
everything	1
so	0
that's	0
one	0
thing	1
that	0

um-hum	0

that	0
that's	1
one	0
thing	1
that	0
that's	0
that's	1
crime	1
that	0
you	0
can't	0
fight	1
it	0
if	0
you	0
need	0
that	0
money	1
so	0

right	0
yeah	0
well	1
when	1
uh	0
we	1
lived	0
in	0
san	1
antonio	1
i	1
grew	1
up	0
around	1
san	0
antonio	0
and	1
it's	1
always	1
been	0
a	1
very	0
large	1
uh	0
city	1
and	0
increasingly	0
growing	1
it's	0
has	1
kind	0
of	1
the	0
split	0
population	1
um	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
retired	0
military	1
uh	0
individuals	1
that	0
live	0
there	0
and	0
then	0
there's	0
a	0
very	0
large	0
hispanic	1
population	0
there	0
and	0
the	0
one	0
thing	0
that	0
we	1
noticed	0
that	1
over	0
the	0
years	1
has	0
gotten	0
worse	0
and	0
worse	1
is	0
hispanic	1
uh	0
gang	0
crime	1
in	0
the	0
city	1

oh	0

and	0
that	1
is	0
uh	0
been	0
the	0
worse	1
thing	0
that	0
we've	0
seen	0
happening	0
uh	0

does	0
it	1
spread	0
out	1
of	1
the	0
neighborhoods	1
into	0
the	1
more	1
the	0
uh	0
retired	1
people's	1
community	0
or	1
does	1
it	0
stay	1
in	1
the	0
bad	0
neighborhood	1

um	0
the	0
majority	1
of	0
the	0
actual	0
gang	1
crimes	1
like	0
the	0
the	0
drive	0
by	0
shootings	1
and	0
stuff	0
stays	0
in	0
the	0
neighborhoods	1
but	0
the	0
crime	1
spreads	0
out	0
into	0
the	0
more	0
affluent	1
uh	0
divisions	1
through	0
robberies	1
rape	1
and	0
uh	0
car	1
crime	0
there's	0
a	0
very	0
large	1
uh	0
or	0
very	0
high	1
percentage	0
of	0
car	1
theft	1
and	1
san	1
an[tonio]	0
san	0
antonio's	0
not	0
far	1
from	0
the	0
border	0
to	0
mexico	1
so	1
a	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
uh	0
cars	1
go	0
to	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
hack	1
shops	0
and	0
they	0
take	0
them_1	0
apart	1
and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
them_1	0
go	0
over	0
the	0
border	1
especially	0
like	0
mercedes	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
those	0
those	1
in	0
the	0
the	0
z	1
uh	0
the	0
z	1
cars	0
the	0
datsun	1
cars	0
end	0
up	0
over	0
the	0
border	1
and	0
uh	0

so	0
that's	0
a	0
big	0
concern	1
if	0
you	0
live	0
there	1
is	0
to	0
really	0
lock	0
your	0
car	0
up	0

very	0
much	0
so	0

very	0
much	0
so	0
in	0
fact	1
um	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
there	1
uh	0
they	0
had	1
downtown	1
if	0
you	1
were	0
to	1
co[me]	0
come	0
to	0
a	0
stop	1
light	0
they	0
had	1
a	0
a	0
rash	1
of	0
where	0
people	0
were	0
uh	0
when	0
people	0
were	0
stopped	0
at	0
stop	1
signs	0
that	0
people	1
would	0
get	0
in	0
their	0
car	1
and	0
hold	0
a	0
knife	1
and	0
hold	0
them	0
up	1
so	0
now	1
uh	0
ever	0
since	1
then	0
when	0
you	0
drive	0
into	0
the	0
city	1
most	0
people	0
keep	0
their	0
doors	0
locked	1
while	0
they're	0
in	1
the	0
car	0
until	0
they	0
get	0
down	1
there	0
and	0
uh	0
once	0
you've	0
reached	1
the	0
the	0
river	1
walk	0
area	0
which	0
is	0
the	0
tourist	1
area	0
it's	0
usually	1
pretty	0
safe	1
during	0
th[e]	0
during	0
the	0
day	1
if	0
you're	0
just	0
kind	0
of	0
cautious	1
and	0
don't	0
go	0
down	0
the	0
back	1
streets	0
or	0
alleys	1
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
or	0
or	0

the	0
people	0
which	0
i	0
mean	0
i	0
guess	0
we	0
everybody's	0
responsible	0
for	0
the	0
society	0
but	0
if	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
child	1
that	1
that	0
that	0
did	0

or	0
with	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
these	0
kids	1

take	0
them	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
environment	1
enough	0

where	0
they	0
don't	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
i'm	0
thirty	0
years	0
old	0
and	0
i'm	0
kind	0

have	0
the	0
morals	1
that	0
keep	0
me	1
from	0
you	0
know	1
if	0
i	0
was	0
going	0

just	0
sitting	0
there	0
in	0
the	0

i	0
rea[lly]	0
i	0
