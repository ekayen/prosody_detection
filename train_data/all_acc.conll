the	0
the	0
different	1
designated	0
areas	1
for	0
smokers	1
and	0
stuff	1
i	1

the	0
no	0

right	1

i	1
think	0
that's	0
great	1

yeah	0
and	0
if	0
you	0
happen	1
to	0
go	1

that	0
is	1
a	0
smoke	0
smoke	1
area	1
and	0
you	0
don't	1

you	0
almost	0

don't	1
smoke	0
and	0
you	0
go	0
in	1
there	0
tha[t]	0
everybody	1
that	0
goes	0
in	0
there	0

in	0
there	1
i	0

really	1
outrageous	1
but	0

and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
she	0
always	1
told	0
me	0
it	0
was	0
because	1
i	0
was	0
still	0
growing	1
and	0
she	0
wasn't	0
going	0
to	0
buy	1
me	0
something	0
i	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
grow	1
out	0
of	0
next	0
week	1

right	1
especially	1
t[o]	0
to	0

kind	0
of	0
money	1
for	0
it	0

yeah	1

i	0

like	1
every	1
time	0
she	0
turned	0
around	1
he	0
was	0
outgrowing	1
stuff	1
and	0

always	0
thought	0
my	0
mom	0

mean	0
i'm	1
going	0
to	0
raise	0
mine	1
the	0
same	0
way	1

right	1

um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0
just	0
ah	0

just	0
so	0
outrageously	0
priced	1
it's	0
just	0
incredible	1

yes	1
and	0
your[self]	0

i	0
try	1
to	0
uh	0
always	1
catch	0
the	0
sales	1

right	1

always	1

and	0
yeah	0
and	0
you	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
keep	1
buying	1
them	0
you	0
know	1
if	0
you	0
if	0
you	0
if	0
you're	0
not	0
buying	1
the	0
most	1
expensive	1
clothes	1
out	0
there	0
the	0
the	0
quality	1
is	0
really	0
not	0
that	0
great	1
you	0
know	0
for	0
the	0
price	1
that	0
you	0
pay	1

yeah	1
it	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
um	1
yeah	0
there's	1
there's	0
always	1
a	0
reason	0
why	1
they're	0
on	0
sale	0

right	1

so	0
that	0
that	1
has	0
a	0
lot	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
it	0

middle	1
of	0
the	0
back	1
of	0

there	1

it's	0
like	1
there	0
it	1
had	0
been	0
slit	1
and	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
just	0
sewed	1
it	0
back	1
together	1
right	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
[laughter-the]	0
the	0
back	1
you	0
know	0
wasn't	0

oh	1
no	1

wasn't	0
a	0
seam	1
or	0
anything	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
that's	1
why	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1
although	1
it's	0
not	1
it's	0
not	1
really	1
noticeable	1
um	0
from	1
the	0
outside	1
but	0
but	0
still	1
it's	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
really	0
not	1
not	0
not	1
a	0
good	0
quality	1

and	0
then	1
i	0
was	0
told	1
by	0
somebody	1
that	0
works	1
for	0
jc	0
penney's	1
that	0
um	0
ross	1
ross	1
is	0
just	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
places	1
that	0
sell[s]	0
sells	0
seconds	1

the	0
defect	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
um	0
they	0
don't	1
really	0
buy	1
the	0
first	0
quality	1
they	0
buy	0
the	0
[laughter-second]	1
and	1
uh	0
places	1
like	0
jc	0
penney's	1
that	0
they'll	0
reject	1
the	0
seconds	0
they'll	0
send	0
them	0
back	1
every	0
time	1
but	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
places	1
like	0
ross	1
dress	1
for	0
less	1
and	0
uh	0
tj	1
max	1

tj	1
max	1
does	0
that	0
yeah	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
we	1
have	0
a	0
tj	0
max	0
over	0
here	1
and	0
um	0

okay	1
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0
about	1
it	0

well	1
uh	1
the	0
roles	1
have	0
definitely	1
changed	1
in	0
the	0
last	1
generation	1
or	0
so	0

oh	1
yeah	1

um	1
i	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
has	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
women	1
working	1

uh-huh	1
yeah	1
i	1
do	0
too	1
i	1
think	0
it's	0
going	0
to	0
in	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
future	1
i	0
think	0
all	1
women	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
work	1

yeah	0

i	1
mean	0
they	0
may	1
let	0
you	0
off	1
for	0
a	0
day	1
or	1
two	0
to	0
have	1
your	0
baby	1
but	0
that	0
will	0
be	0
it	1

yeah	0

or	0
either	0
they'll	0
have	1
a	0
computer	1
at	0
home	1
and	1
in	0
the	0
hospital	1
where	1
you	0
can	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
just	0
continue	1
right	1
on	1
with	0
your	1
work	1

ye[ah]	0
yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
i[t]	1
it	0
really	1
is	1
coming	1
to	0
that	1
because	0
most	1
women	1
now	1
days	0
cannot	1
afford	1
the	1
time	1
that	0
they	1
could	0
take	1
off	1
unless	1
the	0
company	1
pays	1
them	0

right	1
right	0

they	1
can't	0
even	0
afford	1
to	0
take	1
off	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
have	0
children	1
it	0
seems	1
like	0

and	1
it	0
and	0
it	0
seems	1
if	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
have	0
kids	1
uh	1
that	0
you	0
are	1
you	0
know	0
society	1
has	0
decided	1
for	1
you	0
how	0
many	0
you	0
can	0
really	1
have	0
and	0
make	1
it	0

yeah	1

and	0
uh	0
because	1
if	0
you	0
have	1
you	1
know	0
two	1
well	0
if	0
you	0
go	1
to	0
work	1
you're	0
just	0
working	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
day	1
care	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
you	0
know	0
um	0

right	0

now	0
i	1
was	0
real	0
lucky	1
because	0
my	0
husband	1
had	0
a	0
good	0
enough	0
job	1
where	0
when	0
my	1
kids	1
were	0
you	0
know	0
when	0
i	0
had	1
them	1
and	0
when	0
they	0
were	0
small	1
until	0
they	1
got	0
in	0
junior	0
high	1
school	0
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
got	0
in	0
junior	0
high	1
i	0
didn't	1
have	0
to	0
work	1

uh-huh	1

oh	1
that	0
is	1
good	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
didn't	1
work	0
i	0
i	0
needed	1
to	0
but	0
i	0
didn't	1

yeah	0
steve's	1
steve	1
has	0
a	0
sister	1
who	0
has	0
four	1
she	0
just	0
had	1
her	0
fourth	1
one	0
in	0
uh	0
march	1
and	1
she	1
doesn't	0
have	0
to	0
work	0
either	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
they	0
do	1
it	0
i	1
don['t]	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	0
people	0
do	0
it	0
with	0
one	1
you	0
know	1
um	1
obviously	0

let	0
me	0
tell	1
you	0
you	0
go	1
without	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
things	1
that	0
you	0
wou[ld]	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	0
obviously	1
we	1
don't	0
have	1
any	0
and	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
i	1
think	0
that's	0
part	1
of	0
the	0
role	0
reversal	1
is	0
it's	0
okay	1
to	0
get	0
married	1
and	0
not	1
have	0
kids	1

oh	1
yeah	1

and	0
i	0
think	1
for	0
society	1
for	0
such	1
a	0
long	1
time	1
said	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
you're	1
married	1
now	1
you	0
need	0
to	0
se[t]	0
have	0
have	1
your	0
family	1
and	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
it's	0
been	0
until	0
recently	1
that	0
that	0
they	0
had	0
decided	1
that	0
two	1
people	0
was	1
a	0
family	0

right	1
right	0

you	0
know	0
and	0

well	1
it's	0
getting	1
where	0
you	1
can't	0
hardly	0
afford	1
if	0
you're	1
going	0
to	0
give	0
your	0
kids	1
any	0
kind	1
of	0
education	1
and	0
stuff	0
you	1
can't	0
hardly	0
afford	1
to	0
have	1
over	1
two	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
mean	0
it's	0
hard	1
with	0
two	1
now	0
we	1
uh	0
my	1
youngest	1
one	0
i	0
have	0
two	1
i	0
have	0
a	0
son	1
and	0
a	0
daughter	1
and	1
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
graduating	1
from	0
college	1
soon	1

oh	1

but	0
if	0
i	1
had	0
a	0
third	1
one	0
i	1
just	0
don't	0
know	0
where	1
it	0
would	0
come	1
from	0

[laughter-yeah]	0

yeah	0

because	1
i	1
work	0
now	1
i	0
work	1
full	0
time	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
it	0
when	0
you	1
put	0
them	0
through	0
college	1
it	0
just	0
takes	1
just	0
about	0
everything	1
you	0
got	1

yeah	1

they	0
get	0
loans	1
and	0
grants	1
and	0
scholarships	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
that	0
helps	0
out	1
but	0
still	1
it	0
cost	1
a	0
lot	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
mean	0
just	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
cost	1
of	0
living	1
and	0
loans	1
don't	0
pay	1
for	0
groceries	1
and	0
stuff	1

right	1
and	0
cars	1
and	0
all	1
their	0
books	1
and	0
the	0
books	1
are	0
outrageous	1
i	0
mean	1
absolutely	1
outrageous	1
and	0

oh	0
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0

and	0
they're	0
getting	0
worse	1
uh	0
my	0
daughter	1
brought	1
home	0
a	0
book	1
the	0
other	0
day	1
that	0
she	1
was	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
for	0
her	0
one	1
of	0
her	0
next	0
classes	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
like	1
ninety	1
six	0
dollars	1
and	0

jeez	0

and	0
this	1
book	1
is	0
a	0
little	1
bitty	0
skinny	1
book	1

yeah	0

i	1
said	0
my	0
goodness	1
what	0
is	1
it	0
lined	1
in	0
gold	1
you	1
know	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
it	0
is	1
it's	0
getting	0
worse	1
and	0
if	0
i'd	1
of	0
probably	0
had	1
three	1
or	0
four	0
children	1
i	0
don't	0
see	1
how	0
we	0
could	0
have	0
made	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
without	1
me	0
working	0

but	0
that's	1
that's	1
probably	1
because	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
had	1
three	1
you	0
you	0
know	0
would	0
say	0
if	0
i'd	1
of	0
had	0
four	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
always	1
not	1
not	1
being	0
able	0
to	0
picture	1
one	1
more	1
but	0
in	0
essence	1
you	0
probably	1
would	0
have	0
worked	1
out	0
fine	1

right	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	0
to	0
work	1

yeah	1

if	0
i'd	1
of	0
had	0
that	1
many	0
i'd	0
of	0
had	1
to	0
work	1
in	0
order	1
for	0
my	0
kids	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
even	1
though	0
he	0
brings	1
in	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
living	1
and	0
everything	0
in	0
order	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
keep	0
up	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	1
to	0
work	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
getting	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
like	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
one	1
child	1
now	0
that's	0
it	1
you	0
know	0
then	1

then	1
you	0
go	0
to	0
work	1
and	0
you	0
work	1

yeah	0

because	1
if	0
you	1
have	0
two	1
or	0
three	0
kids	1
by	0
the	0
way	1
the	0
inflation's	1
going	0
i	1
think	0
a	0
woman's	1
always	1
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
and	0
it's	0
just	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
an	0
accepted	1
thing	1
there	0
isn't	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
any	0
of	0
this	0
you	0
know	0
very	1
few	0
people	1
will	0
ever	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
that's	1
all	0
right	1
with	0
me	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
want	1
to	0
stay	0
home	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
i	1
think	0
i'm	0
just	0
part	1
of	0
tha[t]	0
the	0
new	1
stuff	1
that	0
is	0
just	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
would	0
just	1
go	0
nuts	1
sitting	0
at	0
home	1
all	1
day	0
long	1

well	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
how	0
i	1
did	0
because	0
now	1
i	0
work	1
all	0
the	0
time	1

yeah	1

and	1
um	0
well	0
i	0
work	1
all	0
week	1
and	1
um	0
i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
how	1
i	0
stayed	0
home	1

yeah	0

you	1
know	0
i	0
think	1
to	0
myself	1
what	1
did	0
i	0
do	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
just	1
it	0
revolutionized	1
an	0
where	0
a	0
woman	1
thinks	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
you	0
know	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
my	1
daughter	1
there's	1
no	0
way	1
that	0
she	1
can	0
imagine	1
herself	0
married	1
at	0
the	0
age	1
that	0
she's	0
at	0
now	1
to	0
her	1
everything	1
is	0
you've	0
got	0
to	0
go	1
through	0
college	1
you've	0
got	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
then	1
when	0
everything's	1
set	0
up	0
then	1
you	0
look	0
for	0
somebody	1
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
spend	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
your	0
life	1
with	0
but	0
i	1
mean	0
it	0
is	0
so	1
far	0
down	0
the	0
road	1
where	0

right	1

where	0
now	1
when	0
i	1
graduated	0
high	1
school	0
the	0
thing	1

that's	1
you	0
did	1
that's	1
what	0
you	0
did	1
uh	1

and	0
then	1
you	0
got	0
married	1
and	0
then	0
you	1
had	0
a	0
family	1

i	1
mean	0
that's	0
just	0
the	0
way	1
it	0
was	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
that's	1
like	0
when	0
my	0
mo[m]	0
i	0

when	0
my	0
mother's	1
age	0
it	1
was	0
always	1

the	0
family	1
and	0
everything	1

stayed	0
home	1
and	0
took	0
care	1
of	0
them	0
an	0

i	1
uh	0

uh	0
being	1
see	0

it's	0
your	1
turn	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
that	1
now	1
even	1
whenever	0
i	1
was	0
coming	0
up	1
and	0
everything	0
and	0
we	1
got	0
married	0
right	1
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0
well	0
a	0
year	1
after	0
i	0
got	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
i	1
didn't	0
have	0
kids	1
for	0
four	1
and	0
a	0
half	0
years	1
but	0
that	1
was	0
because	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
work	1
and	1
i	0
wasn't	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
that's	1
what	0
it	0
is	0
i'm	1
not	0
either	1

and	0
everybody	1
thought	1
oh	1
my	0
gosh	1
what	1
is	0
the	0
matter	1
with	0
her	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

they're	0
probably	1
going	0
oh	1
i	0
bet	1
she	0
can't	1
get	0
pregnant	1

right	1
i	1
mean	0
they	1
thought	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
terrible	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
i'd	0
tell	1
them	0
you	0
know	0
well	0
i'm	1
just	0
not	0
ready	1
for	0
children	1
yet	0
oh	1
but	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
you	1
better	1
you	0
better	1
just	0
get	0
ready	1
now	1

yeah	0

well	0
you	1
don't	0
just	1
get	0
ready	1
but	0
i	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
odd	1
because	0
as	0
a	0
general	0
rule	1
the	0
people	1
that	0
married	1
during	0
my	1
time	1
they	1
had	0
kids	1
within	0
a	0
year	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	1
just	0
was	1
not	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	1
i	1
wanted	0
to	0
get	1
out	0
and	0
work	1
a	0
little	0
bit	1
and	0
i	1
wanted	0
to	0
travel	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
which	0
we	0
did	1
and	1
uh	0
kids	1
didn't	0
fit	0
in	1
right	0
then	1
but	0
it's	0
getting	1
more	0
and	0
more	1
like	0
that	1
where	0
there's	0
more	1
and	0
more	0
couples	1
and	1
really	1
if	0
you	1
don't	0
want	1
the	0
kids	0
then	1
it's	0
not	1
the	0
time	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
i	1
don't	0
care	0
what	0
anybody	1
tells	0
you	0

right	1

and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
the	0
attitude's	1
getting	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
because	1
that's	1
like	0
my	0
daughter	1
now	0
she	1
says	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
maybe	1
when	0
she's	0
thirty	1
she	0
might	1
want	0
a	0
child	0
then	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
even	1
though	0
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
have	0
grandchildren	1
i	1
can	0
see	0
her	0
point	1

yeah	1
steve's	1
mom	1
finally	0
uh	0
finally	1
s[aid]	0
you	0
know	1
said	1
that	0
that	0
god	1
will	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
us	0
when	1
it's	0
our	0
time	1

right	1

she	0
finally	1
admitted	1
you	0
know	0
she	0
finally	1
told	1
me	0
it's	0
okay	1
if	0
you	0
don't	1
but	0
it	1
took	0
every	1
nerve	0
in	0
her	0
body	1
to	0
say	1
that	0
because	0
she's	1
from	0
a	0
very	1
very	0
old	0
fashioned	1
family	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
she	1
stayed	0
home	0
and	0
raised	1
her	0
kids	0
and	0
and	0
she	0
expected	1
all	0
of	0
her	0
kids	1
to	0
do	0
that	0
too	1
and	0
their	1
wives	1
and	0
to	0
be	1
the	0
the	0
housewife	1
and	0
have	0
dinner	1
ready	0
by	0
five	1
and	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
be	1
there	0
at	0
every	0
beck	1
and	0
call	1
and	0
i	1
was	0
raised	0
totally	0
opposite	1
[laughter-how]	1
we	0
got	0
together	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
but	0
because	0
my	1
mother	0
had	0
six	0
girls	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
she	1
worked	0
too	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	0
and	0
i	0
saw	1
how	1
life	1
was	0
when	0
she	0
stayed	0
home	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
rough	1
it	1
was	0
hard	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
and	1
it	0
really	0
is	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
you	0
know	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	1
much	0
more	1
now	0
all	1
my	0
income	1
goes	1
for	0
things	1
like	0
luxuries	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
really	1
does	1
except	1
for	0
what	0
we	1
give	0
to	0
my	0
daughter	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
put	0
her	0
through	0
college	1
and	0
stuff	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
the	0
rest	1
of	0
it	0
we	1
just	0
buy	1
things	1
like	0
boats	1
or	1
we	0
go	0
on	0
trips	1
or	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
the	0
more	1
or	0
less	1
like	0
entertainment	1
stuff	0

right	1

but	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you've	1
earned	1
that	0
though	0

yeah	1
i	1
feel	0
like	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
because	1
well	1
we're	1
to	0
the	0
age	1
now	1
i'm	1
not	0
old	1
but	0
i'm	0
older	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
got	0
to	0
stay	0
home	1
with	0
my	0
kids	1
which	0
i	0
really	1
wanted	1
to	0
do	1
but	0
now	1
i	0
could	0
not	1
go	0
back	1
and	0
do	1
it	0

yeah	0

i	0
really	1
couldn't	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
could	0
stay	1
home	1
all	1
the	0
time	0
and	0
do	0
nothing	1
and	0
i	1
mean	0
i	0
did	1
stuff	0
but	0
to	0
me	1
it	0
[laughter-feels]	1
[laughter-like]	0
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-must]	0
have	0
done	1
nothing	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
just	0
the	0
new	1
way	0
that	0
people	1
are	0
thinking	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
so	1

but	1
uh	0

i	0
think	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
neat	1
if	0
if	0
they	1
could	0
incorporate	1
into	0
small	1
and	0
large	1
businesses	0
both	1
a	0
built	1
in	0
day	1
cares	1
where	0
the	0
children	1
were	0
there	1
in	1
the	0
facility	1
but	0
not	1
necessarily	1
right	1
there	0
with	1
you	0

well	0
you	1
know	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	0
them	0
are	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it	0
is	1
up	0
there	0
where	0
you	1
are	0
but	0
where	0
i	1
am	0
the	0
just	1
like	0
all	1
the	0
hospitals	1
they're	1
getting	0
day	1
care	0

uh-huh	1

are	1
they	0

but	1
the	0
reason	1
they	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
this	0
was	0
because	0
so	1
many	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
so	1
many	0
women	1
could	0
not	1
afford	1
like	0
you	1
said	0
if	0
you	1
had	0
four	1
kids	1
or	0
even	1
if	0
you	1
had	0
two	1
kids	0
you	1
would	0
be	0
paying	1
all	1
your	0
salary	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
those	0
two	0
kids	1
to	0
go	1

right	1

so	1
uh	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	0
our	0
hospitals	1
especially	1
over	0
here	1
are	0
getting	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
bigger	0
companies	1
but	0
it's	0
mainly	1
the	0
hospitals	1

yeah	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
if	0
the	0
ti	1
in	0
dallas	1
does	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	1
nobody	0
around	0
here	1
does	0
it	0
we're	1
it's	0
too	1
small	1
around	0
here	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

well	1
what	1
would	0
you	1
have	0
at	1
a	0
dinner	1
party	1

well	1
uh	1
lately	1
since	1
i	0
have	1
children	1
i've	1
cut	0
down	1
on	1
having	1
dinner	0
parties	1
but	1

uh-huh	1

but	1
when	1
i	0
do	1
i	0
try	1
to	0
keep	1
it	0
pretty	1
simple	1
on	0
things	1
that	0
i	0
can	0
prepare	1
ahead	1
of	0
time	1
uh	0
i	1
have	0
one	1
recipe	0
for	0
uh	0
a	0
really	1
good	1
um	0
type	1
of	0
a	0
meatball	1
it's	0
called	0
burgundy	1
meatballs	1
and	0
it's	0
made	1
with	0
r[ed]	0
red	1
wine	1
and	0
um	0

oh	1
gosh	1
that	1
sounds	1
great	1

um	0

it's	0
it's	0
really	1
good	0
and	0
you	0
can	0
make	1
it	0
ahead	1
of	0
time	1
and	0
then	1
um	0
make	0
the	0
sauce	1
when	1
you're	0
ready	1
to	1
um	0
to	0
serve	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

that's	1
one	0
of	0
my	1
favorite	0
things	1
to	0
to	0
serve	1

well	1
um	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
would	0
probably	1
depend	1
on	0
whether	0
this	0
was	0
a	0
formal	1
or	0
informal	1
dinner	1
party	1

sure	1

but	1
if	1
it	0
was	0
informal	1
my	1
first	0
choice	0
would	0
be	0
crawfish	1

oh	0
really	1
well	1
i	0
guess	1
being	0
from	1
that	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1

because	1
i	1
mean	0
crawfish	1
everybody	1
over	0
here	0
likes	0
crawfish	1
but	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
have	0
to	0
worry	1
about	0
satisfying	1
my	1
guest	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
if	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
formal	1
uh	0
dinner	0
party	1
i	0
would	0
probably	1
think	0
of	0
something	1
else	1
like	0
um	0
shrimp	1
shrimp	1
fettucini	1
is	0
real	0
easy	1
to	0
um	0
make	1
and	0
everything	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
it's	1
usually	0
well	0
liked	1
by	0
people	1
i	0
guess	0
i'm	1
just	0
a	0
seafood	1
fan	1
so	0
i	0
think	1
on	0
the	0
lines	1
oh	1

well	1
how	0
do	1
you	0
make	1
how	1
do	1
you	0
you	0
cook	1
crawfish	1
i	0

i	0
in	1
fact	1
i	1
just	0
came	1
back	0
from	0
the	0
grocery	1
store	1
and	1
being	1
in	0
texas	1
we	0
don't	1
have	0
too	1
many	0
you	1
know	0
people	1
that	1
that	1
eat	1
crawfish	1
but	1
they	1
had	0
live	1
crawfish	1
on	0
sale	1

oh	1
yeah	1
um	0

um	0
you're	0
not	1
supposed	1
to	0
i	0
mean	1
you're	0
not	1
supposed	0
to	0
eat	1
them_1	0
dead	1
i	0
mean	1
well	0
you	0
eat	1
them_1	0
dead	1
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0

don't	1
buy	1
them_1	0
that	0
way	1

right	1
because_1	1
if	0
if	0
they're	0
dead	1
for	0
too	0
long	1
you	0
can	0
always	1
tell	1
whenever	0
they're	0
cooked	1
if	0
they've	0
been	0
dead	1
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
because_1	0
their	0
tail	1
straightens	0
out	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
you're	0
not	1
supposed	0
to	0
eat	1
those	0
because_1	0
they're	0
the	0
bad	1
for	0
you	0

okay	1
well	1
i'll	0
remember	1
that	0

yeah	1
so	0
if	0
you	0
ever	0
go	0
in	0
a	0
restaurant	1
and	0
order	1
crawfish	1
i	0
mean	1
every	0
once	1
in	0
a	0
while	1
you'll	0
see	1
o[ne]	0
i	0
mean	1
it	0
doesn't	1
happen	0
very	0
often	1
because	0
it's	0
just	0
an	0
accident	1
but	0
if	0
the	0
tail	1
is	0
straight	1
on	0
it	0
then	0
yeah	1
don't	0
eat	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
um	0
you	0
just	1
put	1
some	0
cajun	1
well	0
lots	1
of	0
pepper	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
you	0
just	0
boil	1
them	0
and	0
they're	0
absolutely	1
wonderful	1
but	0
there's	1
uh	0
they're	0
a	0
pain	1
to	0
peel	1
for	0
some	1
people	0
once	1
you	0
get	0
used	1
to	0
it	0
they're	0
real	0
easy	1
but	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	1
have	0
nails	1
or	0
anything	0
you	0
can	1
plan	1
on	0
those	0
being	0
shot	1

when	0
you	0
were	1
um	0
whe[n]	1
when	0
you	1
serve	1
it	0
do	0
you	1
shell	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
serve	1
them	0
to	1

i	0
think	1
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	1
i	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
it	0
depends	1

um-hum	1

like	1
if	0
like	1
my	1
age	0
if	0
there	1
was	0
a	0
bunch	0
of	0
college	1
kids	1
coming	1
over	0
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	0
no	0
i	1
they	0
would	0
shell	1
their	0
own	1
you	1

sure	1

you	1
know	0
we'd	1
just	0
have	0
crawfish	1
and	0
beer	1
or	0
something	1
but	1
um	0
if	1
it	0
was	0
more	0
formal	1
like	1
if	0
i	0
was	0
you	0
know	1
working	1
environment	1
then	0
i	0
would	0
probably	1
um	0
sh[ell]	0
shell	1
them_1	0
or	0
at	0
least	1
disconnect	1
them	0
from	0
the	0
head	1
but	0
there's	1
a	0
there's	0
a	0
big	0
thing	1
over	0
here	1
that	0
everybody	1
sucks	0
the	0
head	1

so	0
they	1
don't	0
have	0
see	1
that	0
ooh	1

so	1
um	0
it	0
it	0
would	1
just	0
depend	1
that's	1

that's	1
the	0
best	0
part	1
of	0
the	0
crawfish	1

sucking	1
the	0
head	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
i[t]	0
it	0
just	0
depended	1
on	0
what	0
type	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
guess	1
but	0
you	1
can	0
buy	1
uh	0
the	0
crawfish	1
tails	1
already	0
peeled	1
an[d]	0
everything	1
and	0
usually	1
you	0
use	0
those	1
like	1
for	0
frying	1
or	1
to	0
put	1
in	0
salads	1
or	1
to	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
make	0
a	0
sauce	1
with	0
or	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0
you	1
can	0
go	0
ahead	0
and	0
buy	1
them_1	0
cooked	1
and	0
shelled	1
and	0
they're	1
more	0
expensive	1
of	0
course	1
but	1

does	1
it	0
taste	1
a	0
lot	1
like	0
shrimp	1

um	0
yeah	1
it	0
really	0
does	1
i	0
like	1
shrimp	0
better	1

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

just	1
um	0
but	0
crawfish	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
just	0
has	0
a	0
taste	1
of	0
its	0
own	1
it	0
also	1
depends	1
on	0
who's	1
cooking	1
it	0
and	0
how	0
much	0
seasoning	1
they	0
use	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	1
that	0
but	0

sure	1

but	0
um	0
i	1
think	0
that	1
and	0
also	1
to	0
get	1
totally	1
off	0
c[rawfish]	0
the	0
subject	1
of	0
crawfish	1
lots	1
of	0
vegetables	1
and	0
hors	0
d'oeuvres	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
for	0

um	0
whether	1
it	0
would	0
be	1
ethnic	1

it	0
would	0
be	1
um	0

an	0
outdoor	1
theme	1

recipe	1
for	0
you	0
if	0
you	0

other	0
room	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
we	0
have	0
enough	1
time	1
for	0
it	0
it's	0

oh	1

it's	0
real	1
easy	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
unique	1
things	1
in	0
this	0
like	0
a	0
pound	1
of	0
ground	0
beef	1
some	0
bread	0
crumbs	1
um	0
an	0
egg	1
um	0
um	0
what	1
ever	0
seasoning	1
usually	0
just	0
light	1
seasonings	1

yeah	1

seasonings	1
like	0
salt	1
and	0
pepper	1
um	0
and	0
chopped	1
up	0
water	1
chestnuts	1
which	0
is	0
something	1
different	1
um	0

oh	1

that	0
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1

makes	1
them	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
crunchy	1
you	0
need	1
to	0
chop	0
them_1	0
up	0
real	0
fine	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
it	0
makes	1
them	0
crunchy	1
and	0
that	0
adds	0
something	1
new	0
to	0
it	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
sauce	1
is	0
just	0
made	1
with	0
um	0
bouillon	1
cubes	1
water	1
burgundy	1
wine	1
and	1
um	0
cornstarch	1
instead	0
of	0
flour	1

um-hum	1

oh	1

so	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
thick	1
rich	1
type	0
of	0
a	0
sauce	1
it's	0
more	1
of	0
a	1
when	0
you	0
use	0
corn	1
starch	1
in	0
in	0
gravy	1
like	0
you	1
know	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
um	0
chinese	1
food	0
the	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
gravy	1
or	0
a	0
sauce	1
that	0
comes	0
with	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
they	0
use	0
corn	1
starch	0
instead	1
of	0
flour	1
in	0
all	1
of	0
their	0
sauces	1
and	0
gravies	1

um-hum	1

and	0
it	0
gives	1
it	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
different	1
consistency	1

well	0
um	0
how	0
long	1
do	0
you	1
cook	1
the	0
meatballs	1

the	0
meatballs	1
you	0
just	1
um	0
after	0
you	1
form	1
them	0
fry	1
them	0
in	0
a	0
pan	1
until	1
they're	1
uh	0
browned	1
on	0
all	1
all	0
sides	1
and	0

uh	0
huh	1

and	0
then	0
drain	1
off	0
all	0
the	0
grease	1
uh	0
then	1
what	0
i	0
usually	1
do	0
is	0
i	0
freeze	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you're	0
ready	1
to	0
serve	1
them	0
then	0
you	0
cook	1
the	0
sauce	1
and	0
then	0
put	0
the	1
meatballs	1
into	1
the	0
sauce	0
and	1
heat	1
it	0
probably	1

oh	1

you	0
have	0
to	0
heat	1
it	0
up	0
for	0
a	0
good	1
oh	1
if	0
they're	0
frozen	1
you	0
know	0
it	0
may	0

half	0
hour	1
for	0
them	0

heat	1
them	0
thoroughly	1

probably	1
we	0

extent	1

anniversary	1

no	1
i	0
know	1
this	0
is	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
time	1
to	0

having	0
so	0
many	0
activities	1
and	0

with	0
a	1

the	0
meaning	1
behind	1

yes	1

be	0
excited	1
about	0
all	0
of	0
it	0

uh	0
i[f]	0
so	0
uh	0
well	1
if	1
you're	1
working	1
then	0
you're	0
probably	1
on	0
a	0
limited	1
amount	0
of	0
time	1
per	0
year	1
that	1
you	0
can	1
go	0

well	1
not	0
really	1
uh	0
we're	1
doing	0
the	0
same	0
thing	1
tying	1
it	0
in	0
with	0

and	1
uh	0
just	0
travel	1
whenever	0
we	0
can	1

oh	1
that's	1

well	1
i	1
really	0
i	0
think	1
travel	1
when	0
i	0
heard	0
my	0
topic	1
today	0
i	1
thought	0
okay	1
that's	1
my	0
favo[rite]	0
[laughter-that's]	0
[laughter-my]	0
[laughter-favorite]	0
becau[se]	0

how	1
easy	1

becau[se]	0

right	1

and	0
really	1
at	0
our	0
point	0
of	0
life	1
our	0
children	1
are	1
grown	1
and	1
um	0
it	0
has	1
just	1
worked	0
out	0
really	1
well	1
with	0
this	0
um	0
position	1
he's	0
in	1
because	1
i	1
can	0
go	0
at	0
a	0
spur	1
of	0
the	0
moment	1
or	1
what	0
have	1
you	0
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
it	0
depends	1
where	0
he's	0
going	1
whether	1
or	0
not	0
i	1
decide	0
to	0
go	0
along	1
but	0

sure	1

but	0
i	0
do	1
do	1
like	0
to	0
travel	1
and	0
it's	0
um	0
i	1
don't	1
mind	0
the	0
pool	1
life	1
at	0
all	1
during	0
the	0
day	1

um-hum	0

and	1
i	0
like	0
to	0
sightseeing	1
and	0
i	0
love	1
to	0
shop	1

um-hum	1

[laughter-so]	0
[laughter-it's]	0

so	0
that's	1
perfect	1
what	0
more	1
could	0
you	0
ask	1
for	0

that's	1
right	1
but	0
if	0
thi[s]	0

and	0
then	0
get	0
to	0
pick	1
and	0
choose	1
the	0
places	1

well	1
and	1
one	1
of	0
my	1
very	1
favorite	0
is	0
las	1
vegas	0

ah	0

um	1
that	1
i	1
would	0
have	0
to	1
say	0
we	0
both	1
end	1
up	0
going	0
to	1
las	0
vegas	1
um	1
probably	1
once	1
every	1
maybe	1
year	0
and	1
a	0
half	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
presently	1
we	0
have	1
quite	1
a	0
few	0
frequent	1
flyer	0
miles	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	0
i've	1
just	0
requested	1
that	0
they	1
send	1
us	0
two	1
of	0
our	1
coach	1
tickets	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
flying	0
with	0
continental	1

um-hum	1

and	1
they're	0
recommending	1
that	0
you	0
use	1
those	0
because	1
they	0
don't	1
know	1
the	0
future	1
of	1
continental	0

right	1
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
shaky	1

and	1
i	1
said	1
well	0
now	1
that	1
we	1
have	0
all	1
the	0
miles	1
we	1
better	0
[laughter-start]	1
[laughter-using]	1
[laughter-them]	0

that's	0
true	1
it	0

uh	0
so	0

it	0
really	1
is	1

so	0
we	1
are	0
thinking	1
that	0
we	0
might	0
go	1
to	1
las	0
vegas	1
during	0
the	0
winter	1
this	0
year	0
sometime	1
for	0
just	1
kind	1
of	0
a	0
quick	0
trip	1
um	0
when	0
we	0
normally	1
go	1
that	0
way	0
we	0
like	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
california	1
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	1
because	1
we	0
really	1
don't	1
get	0
out	1
there	0
as	0
often	1
as	0
you	1
could	0
probably	1
from	0
texas	1

um-hum	0
our	1

our	1
last	1
big	0
trip	0
we	0
drove	1
through	0
new	0
mexico	1
and	0
colorado	1
and	0
went	0
to	0
the	0
grand	0
canyon	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
back	1
through	0
silverton	1
and	0
durango	1
and	0
oh	1
it	0
was	0
fun	1
it	0
was	0
so	1
relaxing	1
and	0
a	0
really	1
neat	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1
and	0
the	0
kids	1
were	0
old	1
enough	0
to	0
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
our	0

i	1
think	1
that's	1
a	1
good	1
trip	0

um-hum	0

and	1
really	1
for	0
the	0
children	1
to	0
learn	1
as	1
well	1
for	0
a	0
family	1
vacation	1
that	1
would	0
be	0
excellent	1

right	1

now	1
we	0
did	1
what	1
we	0
sometimes	1
do	1
since	0
we	0
are	1
in	0
ohio	1
and	0
it	0
takes	1
a	0
while	1
just	0
to	0
even	1
get	1
to	0
the	0
what	0
i	1
would	1
call	0
the	0
more	0
picturesque	1
part	1
of	0
the	1
country	1
we	1
will	0
fly	1
to	0
something	1
like	0
once	1
we	0
flew	1
to	0
colorado	1
to	0
denver	1
and	1
then	0
we	0
rented	1
a	0
car	1
for	0
two	1
weeks	0
and	0
we	0
went	0
through	1
the	0
northern	1
route	1
and	0
through	0
utah	1
and	1
as	0
far	1
west	1
as	0
las	0
vegas	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
then	1
we	0
returned	1
through	1
uh	1
new	0
mexico	1
that	1
you	1
just	0
mentioned	1

um-hum	0

and	1
it	0
was	1
oh	1
it	0
was	1
just	1
great	1

oh	1
there's	0
s[o]	0
too	1
much	0
to	0
see	0
really	1

oh	0
i	1
i	1
think	0
that's	0
that's	1
the	1
way	1
to	1

okay	1
so	1
wh[at]	1
now	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
opinions	1
on	0
recycling	1

well	1
i	0
definitely	1
think	0
we	0
need	1
to	0
start	1
recycling	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
has	0
got	1
to	0
be	0
an	0
individual	1
responsibility	1
until	1
i	0
think	1
if	1
we	1
wait	1
uh	0
which	1
is	0
happening	1
until	1
somebody	1
says	0
we	0
have	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
it's	0
gonna	1
be	0
too	0
late	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
i've	1
heard	0
reports	1
around	0
here	1
that	0
the	0
landfills	1
will	0
be	0
full	1
by	0
the	0
year	1
two	0
thousand	1

yeah	1
i've	1
heard	1
that	0
too	1

and	0
that's	0
not	1
too	0
far	0
away	1
but	1
i	1
don't	1
know	0
how	1
it	0
is	0
there	1
it's	0
very	1
difficult	1
here	1
even	1
if	0
you	0
care	1
like	0
i	1
do	0
to	0
do	1
much	1
i	0
take	1
my	0
pap[er]	1
i	0
can	1
take	0
plastic	1
and	0
paper	1
bags	1
back	1
to	0
the	0
grocery	0
store	1
and	0

um-hum	1

and	0
i	1
can	0
take	1
plastic	1
like	0
milk	1
cartons	1
or	0
if	0
they	0
have	0
water	1
in	0
them_1	0
and	1
there's	0
some	0
fire	1
stations	1
i	0
can	1
take	0
newspapers	1
to	0
and	0
that	0
is	0
very	1
inconvenient	1
cause	0
i	0
have	1
to	0
wait	1
[un]til	0
i	0
have	0
enough	1
of	0
them	1
to	0
make	0
the	0
trip	1
worthwhile	1

well	0
see	1
i	1
had	1
started	0
saving	1
newspapers	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
save	1
a	0
ton	1
of	0
them_1	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	0
th[at's]	1
i	1
can't	1
remember	1
where	0
i	1
went	1
to	0
take	1
them_1	0
but	0
they	1
wou[ldn't]	1
they	0
wouldn't	1
take	1
them_1	0

yeah	1
it's	0
very	1
hard	0
to	0
find	1
a	0
spot	1
and	0
then	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
you	0
notice	1
even	1
doing	0
that	1
the	0
amount	1
of	0
trash	1
we	0
throw	0
away	1
is	0
incredible	1
bottles	1
that	1

oh	0
i	1
know	1

glass	1
that	0
cannot	1
be	1
it	0
could	1
be	0
recycled	1
but	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
place	1
to	0

there's	0
no	1
really	0
recycling	1
facilities	1

no	1
we	0
have	1
a	0
pilot	1
program	1
in	0
arlington	1
going	1
on	1
i	0
think	1
in	0
the	0
north	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
city	1
where	1
they're	0
having	1
people	1
separate	1
the	0
garbage	1
as	0
the	0
trash	1
as	0
they	0
put	1
it	0
out	1

i	0
think	1
that's	0
a	0
good	1
idea	1

and	0
i	1
think	0
that's	1
what	0
it	0
is	0
gonna	1
have	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
where	0
we're	0
just	0
forced	1
to	0

besides	1
well	0
like	1
a	0
law	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
that's	1
how	1
it	0
is	0
in	0
new	0
york	1
or	0
isn't	1
it	1

yeah	1

i	1
think	1
so	1
it's	1
just	0
because	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
you	1
know	0

um-hum	1

you	0
get	1
ticketed	1
if	0
you	0
don't	1
do	1
it	0
right	1

right	1
uh-huh	1
and	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
going	0
to	1
come	1
to	1
that	1
because	0
some	1
people	1
will	0
just	1
not	1
go	1
to	0
the	0
it's	0
a	1
it's	0
trouble	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
do	1
what	0
i	0
do	1
i	0

yeah	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
am	0
willing	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
but	1

plus	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
place	1
to	0
store	1
all	1
of	0
it	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
see	0
i	1
live	1
in	0
an	0
apartment	1

yeah	0
it's	0
very	0
difficult	1
like	0
our	0
garage	1
is	0
always	1
full	0
of	0
stacks	1
of	0
newspapers	1
and	0
so	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
think	1
there	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
more	0
places	1
i	0
also	1
have	0
a	0
real	1
strong	0
opinion	1
in	0
iowa	1
the	0
state	1
i'm	0
from	1
uh	1
i	1
believe	0
it's	0
gone	1
up	0
to	1
a	1
dollar	1
now	0
everytime	1

um-hum	1

everytime	1
you	0
buy	1
a	0
container	1
no	0
matter	1
what	1
it	0
is	1
whether	1
it	0
is	0
glass	1
whether	0
it's	0
a	0
beer	1
can	1
or	0
a	0
fifth	1
of	1
whiskey	1
or	0
a	0
pop	1
or	0
whatever	1
you	0
pay	1
ten	1
cents	1
for	0
it	0

yeah	1

and	0
then	0
you	0
take	0
it	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
store	1
and	0
you	0
get	1
it	0
back	1

uh	0
so	0
that	1
way	1
that	1
kind	1
of	0
forces	0
you	0
to	0
recycle	1

you're	0
forced	1
to	0
and	1
uh	0
you	0
also	1
don't	1
see	0
the	0
litter	1
there	0
people	1
just	0

yeah	1
that's	1
true	0

it	0
makes	1
it	0
worthwhile	1
to	0
take	1
it	0
back	1
and	0
i've	0
just	0
started	1
drinking	1
a	0
new	1
water	1
called	1
clearly	1
canadian	1
i	0
don't	1
know	1
if	0
you've	1
tried	1
it	1

yeah	1
i've	1
seen	1
them_1	0

and	0
they	1
have	1
on	1
the	0
ba[ck]	0
it's	0
five	1
cents	0
okay	1
it's	1
still	1
five	1
cents	0

um-hum	1

and	1
it	0
even	0
shows	1
the	0
states	1
that	0

that	0
take	1
them_1	0
back	1

yeah	1
well	0
wh[at]	1
some	0
of	0
them	0
are	0
five	1
some	1
are	0
ten	1
cents	1
i	0
am	0
looking	1
at	0
it	1
right	0
now	1

is	0
texas	1
one	1
of	0
them_1	0

texas	1
is	0
not	0
one	1
of	0
them	1
see	1
so	1
i	0
have	1
to	1
throw	1
them_1	0
away	1
cause	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
to	1
take	0
glass	1

yeah	1
no	1
i	0
don't	1
think	0
that	0
there's	1
enough	1
being	0
done	1
now	1
i	0
work	1
at	0
jc	1
penney	1
at	0
their	0
corporate	1
headquarters	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
we	1
have	1
a	0
paper	1
recycling	1
program	1
that's	0
um	1
company	1
wide	1
and	0
i	0
do	1
the	0
recycling	1
for	0
that	1

do	1
they	1
save	1
like	0
the	0
paper	1
the[y]	1
they	0
use	1
like	1
the	1
office	1
paper	1

yeah	1

good	1
because_1	0
there	1
is	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
waste	1
there	0
isn't	1
there	0

yeah	1
i	0
know	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
computer	1
paper	1
though	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
use	1

right	1

right	1

but	0
um	0
we	1
use	0
to	0
have	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
i	0
don't	0
even	1
remember	0
how	1
much	0
money	1
that	0
they've	1
um	1
m[ean]	1
i	0
mean	1
the	0
money	1
that	0
they've	0
made	1
from	0
the	0
recycling	1
program	1
they've	0
donated	1
it	0
to	0
charities	1

right	1

i	0
mean	1
they've	1
made	1
a	0
substantial	1
amount	0
of	0
money	1
from	0
it	0

yeah	1

something	1
else	1
i	0
think	1
we	0
can	0
do	1
is	0
support	1
companies	1
that	0
encourage	1
like	1
i've	1
decided	1
downy	1
fabric	1
softener	1
now	0
has	1
where	0
you	0
can	1
buy	1
a	0
little	1
carton	1

yeah	1

you	0
add	0
water	1
i'll	1
i	0
image	1
everybody	1
else	1
will	0
start	0
doing	1
that	0
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
but	0
i	1
am	0
going	0
to	0
stick	1
with	0
downy	1
because	0
they	1
were	0
first	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
i	0
want	0
them	0
to	0
have	1
my	0
business	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
packaging	1
could	0
be	0
done	1
much	0
better	1
there	0
is	0
so	0
much	1
plastic	1
that	1

well	0
now	1
you	0
see	1
some	1
of	0
this	0
stuff	1
and	0
you're	1
and	0
then	0
when	0
they	0
come	1
out	0
with	0
the	0
new	1
things	1
you	0
are	0
like	1
uh	0
well	0
why	1
didn't	0
you	0
think	1
of	0
that	0
before	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
just	0
people	0
have	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
aware	1
unfortunately	1
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	1
that	0
just	0
don't	1
care	1
and	0
they	0
don't	1
wanna	0
think	1
about	1
it	0

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
just	0
look	1
at	0
it	0
as	0
i	0
don't	0
want	0
my	1
grandchildren	1
looking	1
at	0
me	0
and	0
saying	1
why	1
didn't	0
you	0
do	1
something	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
want	0
to	0
feel	1
like	0
i	0
at	0
least	1
tried	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
it	0
just	0
may	1
overwhelm	1
us	0
here	1
when	0
we	0
run	1
out	0
of	0
places	1
to	0
put	1
it	0
then	1
we'll	0
be	0
forced	1
to	0
it	0
may	1
be	0
too	0
late	1

do	0
they	1
not	1
ever	0
i	0
mean	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
that	0
much	1
do	0
they	1
not	0
ever	1
burn	1
trash	1
or	0
anything	1
like	1

very	1
little	1
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
and	0
if	0
you've	0
ever	1
know	1
like	0

then	0
that's	1
pollution	1

i	1
know	0
amway	1
i	0
only	0
use	1
a	0
couple	1
things	0
form	0
amway	1
that	0
it	1
says	1
this	1
is	1
burnable	1
material	1
well	1
that	0
doesn't	1
do	1
me	0
any	0
good	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
any	0
place	1
to	0
burn	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
i	0
guess	1
you	0
run	1
into	0
the	0
pollution	1
factor	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	1
just	1
like	0
the	0
glass	1
bottles	1
th[at]	0
that	0
says	1
on	0
the	0
bottle	1
i	0
can	0
get	0
ten	1
cents	1
but	0
not	1
in	0
texas	1

yeah	1

and	0
there's	0
no	1
place	1
i	0
can	0
take	1
glass	1
to	0

so	1
i	0
still	1
throw	0
away	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
glass	1

truly	0
sad	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	1
the	0
packaging	1
really	1
grips	1
me	0
you	0
buy	1
something	1
it's	0
got	0
a	0
great	1
big	0
piece	1
of	0
cardboard	1
and	0
a	0
great	1
big	0
piece	1
of	0
plas[tic]	1

all	0
right	1

have	1
you	1
ever	1
been	1
drug	1
tested	1

um	1
that's	1
a	0
good	0
question	1
um	0
uh	0
i	1
had	1
a	1
job	1
i	1
had	1
to	0
go	0
get	0
a	0
blood	1
test	0
for	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
and	0

and	0
they	0
and	1
they	0
did	0
a	0
full	1
blood	1
screen	0
on	1
me	0
but	0
they	1
didn't	0
call	1
that	0
a	0
drug	1
test	0
so	0
tha[t]	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
checked	1
for	0
drugs	0
they	0
just	0
don't	0
tell	1
you	0
they	1
did	0

yeah	1

i	0
had	1
i've	1
had	1
uh	0
two	1
or	1
three	1
drug	1
tests	0
that	1
i	1
had	1
to	0
get	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
start	1
working	1
at	0
a	1
job	1
uh	1
different	0
jobs	1
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
had	0
one	1
at	0
ti	1
and	0
then	0
one	0
at	1
another	0
engineering	1
company	0
and	0
really	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
don't	0
mind	1
them	1
i	1
don't	0
do	0
drugs	1
anyway	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
i	0
did	1
maybe	0
i	0
would	1
[laughter-but]	0
um	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	1
know	0
a	0
girl	1
that	0
she's	1
a	0
nurse	1
and	0
they	1
get	0
drug	0
tested	0
randomly	1
i've	1
never	0
been	0
randomly	1
drug	0
tested	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
that	1
would	0
probably	0
bother	1
me	0
to	1
wake	1
up	0
one	1
day	1
and	1
find	1
out	0
halfway	1
through	0
the	1
day	0
that	0
you're	0
going	1
to	1
be	1
drug	1
tested	1
and	1
you	1
didn't	0
know	1
about	1
it	1

yeah	0
well	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
depends	1
on	0
if	0
you	0
got	1
something	0
to	0
worry	1
about	0

yeah	1
i	1
guess	1
so	0
i	0
guess	1
so	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
it's	0
right	1

well	1
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
i	0
come	1
from	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
biased	1
opinion	1
because	0
i'm	1
a	0
a	0
therapist	1
and	0
a	0
drug	1
and	0
alcohol	1
counselor	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
i've	1
done	0
employee	0
assistant	1
work	0
and	0
i	0
i	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
kind	1
of	0
cost	1
businesses	1
go	0
through	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
accidents	1
on	0
the	0
job	1
that	0
are	0
specifically	1
drug	0
and	0
alcohol	0
related	1

right	0

right	1

and	0
it's	0
like	0
in	0
the	0
billions	1
of	0
dollars	1
every	0
year	1
um	0
and	0
th[e]	0
the	0
only	0
way	1
that	0
they	1
can	0
prevent	1
that	0
is	0
is	0
you	1
know	0
making	0
sure	1
that	0
the	0
employees	1
are	0
drug	1
and	0
alcohol	0
free	1

that's	0
true	1

and	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
the	0
problem	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
is	0
that	0
that	0
people	1
are	0
like	1
if	0
your	0
boss	1
is	0
your	0
drinking	1
buddy	0
or	0
whatever	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
can	0
come	0
to	0
come	0
to	0
work	1
drunk	1
and	0
get	1
in	0
an	0
accident	1
and	0
he'll	0
cover	0
up	1
for	0
you	0
and	0
nobody	0
knows	1
about	0
it	0
but	0

right	0

but	0
c[ould]	0
you	0
know	1
ends	1
up	0
costing	1
the	0
company	1
lots	1
and	0
lots	1
of	0
money	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

i	1
believe	0
it's	0
right	1
especially	1
for	0
certain	1
jobs	1

you	1
know	0
there	1

i	0
think	0
anyone	1
in	0
a	0
in	0
a	0
public	1
job	0
like	0
bus	1
drivers	0
and	0
cab	1
drivers	0
and	0
police	1
officers	0
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
i	1

uh-huh	0

i	1
think	0
they	1
should	0
be	0
randomly	1
drug	1
tested	0
i	1

yeah	0

i	1
believe	0
full	1
force	1
in	0
that	1

yeah	0

i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
i	1
believe	0
every	0
secretary	1
in	0
every	0
company	1
needs	0
to	0
be	1

true	1

you	1
know	0
secretaries	1
aren't	0
aren't	1
really	0
going	0
to	0
cost	0
the	0
company	0
that	1
much	0
money	1
if	0
they	0
fall	1
face	0
forward	0
in	0
their	0
typewriter	1
or	0
something	1
[laughter-so]	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i'm	1
kind	0
of	0
biased	1
too	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
do	1
drugs	0
and	0
so	1
i	1
really	0
don't	0
care	1
one	0
way	0
or	0
another	1
if	0
anybody	1
wants	0
to	0
pull	0
me	0
up	0
tomorrow	1
and	0
test	1
me	0
because	0
i	0
have	1
nothing	0
to	0
worry	1
about	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

so	0
i	1
guess	0
that's	1
kind	0
of	0
biased	1

yeah	0
well	1
and	0
it's	0
i	0
i	0
think	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
problems	1
with	0
it	0
is	0
it	0
affects	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
other	1
folks	0
on	0
the	0
job	1
if	0
somebody	0
else	1
is	0
impaired	1

yeah	1
it	0
does	1

because	1
generally	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
um	0
you	0
find	0
out	1
one	1
way	0
or	0
another	1
if	0
somebody's	1
got	0
a	0
problem	1
on	0
the	0
job	1

yeah	1
that's	1
true	0

and	1
if	0
e[ven]	0
even	1
if	0
like	1
you	0
say	1
even	1
if	0
it's	0
just	1
the	0
secretary	1
if	0
her	0
work	1
or	0
abilities	1
start	0
affecting	1
her	0
coworkers	1
then	1
it	0
it's	0
still	1
a	0
problem	1

yeah	0

that's	1
true	1

so	0

but	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
do	0
about	0
the	0
occasional	1
user	0
that	0
may	1
have	0
gone	1
to	0
a	0
party	1
three	1
days	0
before	1

and	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
it's	0
been	1
the	0
whole	0
weekend	1
since	0
they've	0
done	1
anything	0
and	0
they	0
happen	1
to	0
be	0
tested	1
monday	0
morning	1
and	0
they	1
could	0
be	0
fired	1
for	0
that	0
you	0
know	1
that	1
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
unfair	0
also	1

well	0
yeah	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
comes	1
with	0
the	0
turf	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
so	1
i	0
guess	0
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
suffer	1
the	0
[laughter-consequences]	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
you're	0
i[n]	0
i[n]	0
in	0
terms	1
of	0
drugs	1
they're	0
illegal	1
so	0
you're	0
you're	0
breaking	1
the	0
law	0
anyway	1

that's	1
true	0

that's	0
true	1

probably	1
the	0
the	0
biggest	1
problem	0
with	0
those	1
is	0
they	0
don't	1
do	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
job	1
of	0
of	0
assessing	1
for	0
alcohol	1

that's	0
true	1

and	0
that's	1
probably	0
the	0
biggest	1
problem	0
there	0
is	1

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
so	1
more	1
than	0
drugs	1
and	0
i	1
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
companies	0
that	0
will	1
put	1
you	0
in	0
an	0
alcohol	1
rehabilitation	0
before	1
they	0
would	0
put	0
you	0
in	0
a	0
drug	1
rehab	0

yeah	0

they	0
would	0
pay	1
for	0
an	0
alcohol	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
they	1
don't	0
always	0
pay	1
for	0
drug	1
rehabilitation	0

well	0
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
positive	1
things	0
that	1
ha[s]	0
has	1
come	0
out	1
of	0
it	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
employee	0
assistance	1
program	0
if	0
you	0
do	1
test	0
positive	1
for	0
something	0
they	0
will	1
give	0
you	0
an	0
opp[ortunity]	0
o[pportunity]	0
opportunity	1
to	0
go	1
get	0
your	0
life	1
straight	0
rather	1
than	0
to	0
lose	1
your	0
job	1

yeah	0

that's	1
true	0

and	0
i	1
th[ink]	0

i	1
think	0
that's	0
fair	1

th[ink]	0

yeah	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
benef[its]	1
the	0
company	1
benefits	0
in	0
the	0
long	1
run	0

yeah	0
that's	1
true	0
that's	1
about	0
all	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
say	0
on	1
it	0

what	1
what	1
kind	0
of	0
testing	1
do	0
they	0
do	1
when	0
you	0
went	1

uh	0
it's	0
a	0
urine	1
test	0

urine	0
screen	1
yeah	1

and	1
they	0
uh	0

yeah	1

it	0
was	0
really	1
very	1
official	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
in	1
a	0
room	1
solely	1
by	0
yourself	1
sign	0
papers	1
that	1
say	1
you	0
were	0
totally	1
alone	1
sign	1
papers	1
that	0
say	1
this	0
is	1
yours	1
and	1

and	1
and	0
you	1
have	0
to	0
fill	1
the	0
bottle	1
yourself	1
and	0
label	1
it	0
yourself	1
and	0
all	1
of	0
that	1
so	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
that	0
they're	1
sure	1
that	1
you	0
haven't	1
borrowed	1
anybody's	1
i	0
guess	1
or	0
something	1

well	0
that	1
happens	1

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
i	0

i	0
ca[n't]	1
it's	0
hard	1
to	0
believe	1
but	0

[laughter-it]	0
happens	0
a	0
lot	1

but	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
does	1

there	0
there	0
are	0
people	1
that	0
kn[ow]	0
pay	1
other	0
people	0
for	0
that	0
to	0
help	1
them	0
out	0

i	0
know	1
i'm	0
amazed	1
at	0
the	0
things	0
people	1
will	0
do	1

yeah	1

it	0
is	1
amazing	1
i	0
guess	1
there	0
are	1
people	1
that	0
do	1
that	0
and	1
they	1
are	1
those	1
are	0
expensive	0
tests	1
i'm	0
glad	1
i	0
never	0
had	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
one	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
it	0
depends	1
r[eally]	0
r[eally]	0
really	1
on	0
how	1
how	0
strong	1
a	0
test	0
it	0
is	1
they've	0
got	0
different	0
degrees	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
as	0
how	1
far	0
back	1
they	0
can	0
check	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	0
so	1

they	0
got	1
some	0
unusual	1
things	0
besides	1
blood	0
and	0
urine	1
tests	0
they've	0
they've	1
got	0
some	1
companies	0
that	0
are	0
doing	1
um	0
hair	1
tests	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1
well	0
that	1
they'll	0
pull	1
out	0
one	0
of	0
your	0
hairs	1
and	0
they	0
can	0
apparently	1
test	1
um	0
back	1
a	0
certain	0
period	0
of	0
time	1
um	0
because	1
um	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
residue	1
ends	0
up	0
in	0
your	0
hair	1
follicles	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0

how	1
weird	1
i	0
didn't	1
know	0
that	1

it's	0
kind	1
of	0

oh	0
that's	0
weird	1

hair	1
follicles	0
i	0
guess	1
are	0
just	0
dead	0
protein	1
and	0
they	0

yeah	1

and	0
it	0
it's	0
apparently	1
al[most]	0
almost	0
like	1
a	0
a	0
calendar	1
they	0
they've	0
got	1
it	0
pretty	1
precise	1
now	1
that	0
they	0
can	0
go	0
back	1
and	0
look	1
at	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
growth	1
in	0
a	0
hair	1
when	1
you	0
used	1
and	1
and	0
that	1
type	0
of	0
thing	0

that's	1
wild	1

so	0

it's	1
amazing	1
the	0
things	1
they	0
can	0
find	0
out	1
from	1
different	0
things	1
on	0
your	1
body	1

yeah	0
so	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
they	0
perfect	1
that	1
and	0
then	0
it's	0
not	1
quite	1
as	0
cumbersome	1
as	0
having	0
to	0
go	0
fill	1
a	0
bottle	1
or	0
give	0
blood	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
[laughter-that's]	1
[laughter-true]	1

that's	1
true	0
i'm	1
glad	1
i	0
never	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
by	0
giving	0
blood	1
i	0
can't	1
stand	1
the	0
thought	0
of	0
giving	0
blood	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
can't	1
even	0
do	1
it	0
for	0
wadley	1
even	0
though	0
it's	0
a	0
good	0
cause	1

yeah	0

well	0
i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	1
to	0
you	0

well	1
i	1
did	0
too	1

thank	1
you	0

uh-huh	0
bye	1

bye	1
bye	0

bye	1
bye	0

okay	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
puppy	1
you	1
got	1

well	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
she's	0
mostly	1
german	0
shepherd	1
uh	1
she	0
was	1
uh	0
uh	0
a	1
person	1
lives	1
across	0
the	0
street	1
from	1
me	0
uh	0
brought	0
her	0

nice	1
talking	0
to	0
you	0
we	0
seem	1
to	0
be	0
degenerating	1
here	0
so	1

okay	1

the	1
topic	1
is	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
uh	1
sources	1
where	1
i	1
receive	1
news	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
for	0
me	1
that's	0
uh	1
mostly	0
newspaper	1
and	0
radio	1
i	1
almost	0
never	1
watch	1
television	1
as	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0
course	1
so	0
i	1
don't	0
get	0
news	0
from	0
television	1
except	0
during	1
the	0
war	0
i	0
watched	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
cnn	1
because	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
good	1

uh-huh	0

well	0
why	1
was	0
cnn	1
the	0
on[ly]	0
of	0
course	0
i	0
think	1
saddam	1
hussein	1
only	1
allowed	1
cnn	0
to	1
broadcast	1
it	0
is	1
that	0
not	0
true	1

um	0

it	1
was	0
unusual	1
not	0
to	1
have	0
the	1
different	1
sources	1
you	1
know	1
of	0
news	0
coverage	1

yeah	1
um	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	0
guess	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
even	0
know	0
why	1
i	0
watch	0
cnn	1
i	0
guess	0
i	1
just	0
wanted	1
more	0
news	1
it's	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
few	0
times	1
i	0
wanted	0
more	0
news	0
than	0

yeah	1
well	0
i	1
know	0
even	1
if	0
you	0
watched	0
abc	1
nbc	0
or	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
y[ou]	0
i	1
mean	0
what's	1
the	0
other	0
one	0
uh	0
cbs	1

cbs	1

they	0
all	1
were	0
were	0
tapped	1
into	0
cnn	1

were	1
they	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

that's	1
the	0
only	0
thing	0
they	0
broadcast	1
an[d]	0
like	1
you	0
i	1
listen	0
to	0
the	0
radio	0
on	0
my	0
job	1
at	0
work	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
all	1
this	0
week	0
they've	1
been	0
having	0
this	0
uh	1
a	0
discussion	1
about	0
that	0
is	0
why	1
uh	0
why	1
cnn	0
was	0
well	0
i	1
listen	0
to	0
a	0
christian	1
radio	0
station	0

um-hum	0

and	1
they	1
were	0
saying	1
that	1
cnn	1
is	0
definitely	1
a	1
world	1
uh	1
news	0
service	1
and	1
uh	0
that	1
was	0
you	1
can't	1
really	0
be	1
sure	1
of	1
the	0
quality	1
of	1
what	0
you	0
got	1
you	1
know	1

hm	0

uh	0
we	0
had	1
some	0
uh	0
some	0
people	1
from	0
our	0
church	1
went	0
to	0
israel	1
uh	0
just	0
for	1
a	0
uh	0
tour	1
sort	1
of	0
thing	0

um-hum	0

and	1
i	0
was	0
watching	1
on	0
tv	1
they	0
they	0
broadcast	0
this	0
terrible	1
riot	1
supposedly	0
that	0
was	0
going	1
on	0
in	0
jerusalem	1
so	0
we	0
got	0
all	1
fearful	1
for	0
our	1
people	0
come	0
to	0
find	0
out	1
they	0
came	0
back	1
and	0
said	0
they	0
weren't	0
even	0
aware	1
of	0
it	0

right	1

and	0
so	1
it	0
really	1
made	0
me	0
question	1
as	0
to	1
what	1
how	1
do	0
we	0
know	1
ab[out]	0
you	0
know	1
uh	0
if	1
the	1
news	1
we're	0
getting	1
is	0
any	0
good	1
so	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	0
the	0
news	0
just	0
focuses	0
on	0
major	0
events	1
that	0
probably	0
don't	0
affect	0
ninety	0
nine	0
percent	0
of	1
the	0
people	1
who	0
are	0
right	0
there	1
when	0
the	0
news	0
is	0
being	0
made	1

yeah	1

right	1
right	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
c[an]	0
i'm	1
from	0
california	1
and	0
i	1
can	0
remember	0
being	0
in	0
uh	0
in	0
these	0
earthquakes	1
and	0
i	0
mean	0
they	1
were	0
they	0
were	0
very	0
minor	1
kinds	0
of	0
things	1
from	0
my	1
point	0
of	0
view	0
and	0
it	0
seemed	1
you	0
know	0
from	0
anyone	0
else's	1
point	0
of	0
view	0
but	0

yeah	0

but	0
they'd	0
get	0
all	1
blown	0
up	0
in	0
the	0
news	0
uh	0

uh-huh	0
well	0
i	1
it	0
i	1
find	0
it	0
depressing	1
to	0
watch	1
or	0
especially	1
tv	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0
uh	0
local	1
news	0
concentrates	1
on	0
murders	1
and	0
things	0
like	0

i'm	1
from	0
dallas	1
and	0
uh	0
we	0
have	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
bad	1
stuff	1
it	0
just	0
really	1
gets	0
me	0
depressed	1
even	0
to	0
watch	1
it	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0
yeah	1

so	0
then	1
you	0
wake	1
up	0
one	0
morning	0
and	0
you're	0
in	0
war	1
with	0
somebody	0

it's	0
just	0
something	1
i've	0
never	0

interest	1
in	0

huh	0

and	0
i	1
live	0
in	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
bad	1
area	0
where	0
if	0

it's	0
stolen	1
before	1
i	0
[laughter-can]	0
[laughter-get]	0
[laughter-out]	1
and	0
get	1
it	0

go[d]	1
that's	1
uh	0
that	0
sounds	1
pretty	0
bad	1
to	0
me	0
i	0
mean	0
who	0
would	0
steal	1
a	0
newspaper	1

you'd	0
be	0
surprised	1

hm	0

they	0
just	0
come	0
by	1
and	0
pick	1
them_1	0
up	0
even	0
if	0
it's	0

the	0
tv	1
you	0

uh	0
selections	1
of	0
the	0

know	0
it	0
just	0
wouldn't	0
be	1
there	0
whenever	0
i've	0
tried	1
it	0

yeah	1

so	0
you're	0
right	1
who	0
would	0
steal	1
a	0
newspaper	1
but	1
they	0
do	1

yeah	1

what	0

for	0
ti	0

no	1
i	0
don't	0
i	0
work	0
for	0
north	0
carolina	1
state	0
university	0

huh	0

but	0
uh	0
i	1
know	0
some	0
people	0
at	0
ti	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
students	1
who	0
have	0
graduated	1
and	0
gone	1
to	0

them	0

yeah	1

so	0
i'm	1
in	0
the	0
computer	1
business	0

well	1
i	1
boy	1
current	0
events	0
is	0
not	1
a	0
good	0
subject	1
for	0
me	0

well	1

i	1
don't	1
keep	0
up	1
with	0
it	0
that	0
often	1

let's	0
see	1
i've	0
i've	0
i've	1
never	0
done	1
this	0
before	0
i	0
mean	0
i've	1
never	0

this	1
is	0
your	0
first	0
call	1

this	0
is	0
my	0
first	0
call	1
because_1	0
i	0
just	0
got	1
my	0
password	1

oh	0
really	1
yeah	1
well	1

so	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
are	0
we	0
suppose	1
to	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
me	0
it	0
says	0
you're	0
supposed	0
to	0
talk	1
for	0
three	0
minutes	1
but	0
i	0
think	0
we've	0
been	0
talking	1
for	0
three	0
minutes	0
and	0
nobody	0
has	0
interrupted	1

well	1
i'd	0
i	0
got	1
into	0
a	0
conversation	0
last	1
night	0
with	0
a	0
lady	1
and	0
they	0
interrupt	1
at	0
ten	1
minutes	1

i	1
see	0

so	1
if	0
we've	0
done	1
our	0
three	0
minutes	0
let's	0
just	0
let	1
the	0
conversation	0
end	1
and	0
say	0
bye	1

uh-huh	0

well	0
all	0
right	1
nice	0
talking	1
to	0
you	0

[laughter-nice]	1
[laughter-talking]	0
to	0
you	0
too	0
bye-bye	1

all	1
right	0
bye	1

bye-bye	1

okay	0
do	1
you	0
vote	0
regular	1

yeah	1
i	0
do	0
i	0
try	0
and	0
vote	1
in	0
every	1
single	0
election	1

every	1
one	0

but	1
uh	0
that's	0
just	0
since	1
in	0
the	0
past	0
say	0
about	1
six	0
years	1
before	1
that	0
i	0
really	0
didn't	0
pay	0
any	0
attention	1
at	0
all	1

well	0
see	0
that's	0
me	1
i've	0
never	0
paid	1
any	0
attention	1
to	0
voting	1

oh	0
you	0
haven't	0

hum-um	0

yeah	0
i	0
didn't	0
use	0
to	0
but	0
now	0
i	0
really	0
because_1	0
i	0
get	0
so	0
angry	0
about	0
what	0
goes	0
on	0
and	0
then	0
i	1
feel	1
like	0
i	0
can't	1
really	0
complain	1
too	0
much	0
unless	1

unless	1
you	1
have	1
something	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
it	0

yeah	0

right	0

but	0
the	1
problem	1
is	0
that	1
i	0
am	1
very	1
liberal	1
politically	1
and	0
so	1
i	0
hardly	1
ever	1
have	0
anybody	1
that	1
wins	1
that	0
i	0
[laughter-vote]	1
[laughter-for]	1

oh	0
liberal	1
by	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
liberal	1
um	0

liberal	0
politically	1
i'm	1
you	0
know	1
like	0
pretty	0
left	1
wing	0
demo[crat]	0
democrat	0
so	0

well	0
see	1
i	0
don't	1
know	1
anything	0
about	0
politics	1

oh	1
you	1
don't	1

uh	0
what's	1
the	0
main	0
what's	0
the	0
main	1
difference	0
between	1
republicans	0
and	1
democrats	0

okay	0
well	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them_1	1
um	0
[de]pends	1
on	0
what	0
issue	1
you're	1
talking	0
about	1
but	0
democrats	1
are	0
on	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
issues	0
are	1
more	0
liberal	0
than	0
republicans	1
and	0
well	0
it	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1
to	0
say	1
now	1
especially	0
after	0
desert	1
storm	1
but	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
back	1
in	0
the	0
eigh[ties]	1
times	1
when	0
uh	0
my	1
political	0
opinions	1
were	0
being	1
formed	1
like	0
in	0
viet[nam]	1
during	1
the	0
vietnam	1
war	1
and	0
stuff	1
the	0
republicans	1
were	1
more	1
you	0
know	1
what	1
they	0
called	0
hawks	1
which	0
is	0
more	1
like	0
aggressive	1
in	0
war	1
and	0
more	0
pro-war	1
and	0
pro-aggression	1
and	1

uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
um	0
the	0
democrats	1
were	0
the	0
doves	1
they	0
were	1
more	0
for	0
peace	1
and	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	1
how	0
much	0
that	0
holds	1
true	0
anymore	1
i	0
think	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
issues	0
are	0

okay	0
and	0
you	0
vote	1
for	0
the	0
democrats	1
or	0

yeah	0

usually	0

yeah	0
and	0
democrats	0
usually	0
are	0
su[pportive]	0
more	0
supportive	0
of	0
public	0
assistance	0
programs	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
and	0
programs	0
to	0
um	0
th[e]	0
the	0
big	1
republican	1
thing	0
is	0
that	0
they	0
don't	1
they	0
vote	1
for	0
less	0
government	1
they	0
want	0
less	1
government	0
involvement	1
in	0
society	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
they're	1
more	0
less	1
apt	0
to	0
vote	1
in	1
you	0
know	0
more	1
aid	1
to	0
people	1
or	0
more	1
m[ore]	1
uh	0
they're	0
less	1
apt	0
to	0
vote	0
in	1
programs	1
that	0
involve	1
the	0
government	1
running	0
things	1

huh	0
okay	0

so	0
so	0
have	0
you	0
ever	0
voted	1
at	0
all	1

no	0
i	0
never	0
have	0

you	0
haven't	0

hum-um	0

how	0
old	0
are	0
you	0

i'm	0
twenty	0
six	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
mu[ch]	1
that	0
much	0
about	1

don't	0
keep	1
up	0

yeah	0

[laughter-okay]	0

yeah	0
that's	1
okay	0

well	1
well	1
that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
like	0
i	0
didn't	1
know	1
what	0
the	0
difference	1
between	0
dukakis	1
and	0
bush	0
was	1

um-hum	0

you	0
know	1
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
anything	1
about	0
bush	1
or	0
dukakis	1

so	1
what	0
do	1
you	0
think	1
about	1
uh	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
about	1
what	0
you	0
see	1
on	0
tv	1
about	0
them_1	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
news	1
or	0
on	0
the	0
ads	1
do	1
you	1
kind	1
of	0
just	1

okay	0
i	0
don't	0
remember	1
anything	0
about	0
dukakis	1

you	0
don't	0

but	1
well	0
they're	0
all	1
saying	0
that	0
they're	0
going	1
to	0
do	1
you	0
know	1
whatever	0
is	0
best	1
for	0
their	0
campaign	1
anyway	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
if	0
they	0
had	1
some	0
kind	0
of	0
public	0
programs	1
where	0
you	0
can	0
just	0
go	0
out	1
and	0

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
like	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
school	0
they	1
didn't	0
teach	1
you	0
about	1
demo[crats]	1
uh	0
the	0
government	1
not	0
really	1

right	0

you	0
didn't	1
get	0
any	0
government	0
classes	1

hum-um	0

yeah	0
it's	0
really	1
hard	1
too	0
because	0
before	1
they	0
used	0
to	0
have	1
um	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
the	0
stuff	1
that	0
they	0
put	0
out	0
now	1
it	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
doesn't	1
just	0
seem	1
like	1
it	0
i	0
know	0
for	0
a	0
fact	1
that	0
the	1
any	1
kind	0
of	0
stuff	1
that	0
if	0
you	1
wrote	1
and	0
asked	1
for	0
material	1
well	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
believe	1
in	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
believe	1
in	1
they	0
don't	0
take	1
any	0
stands	0
on	0
anything	1
they	0
kind	0
of	0
say	1
well	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
want	1
me	0
to	0
believe	1

yeah	0

or	0
they	0
word	1
it	0
so	0
that	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	1
to	0
tell	1
where	0
they're	0
standing	1
on	0
certain	0
issues	1

well	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
they're	0
yeah	0
i	0
know	0
how	1
they	0
do	0
it	1
it	0

um-hum	0

it	0
like	0
i[t]	0
with	0
the	0
abortion	0
issues	0
and	0
stuff	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
kind	0
of	0
take	0
a	0
stand	1
on	0
some	1
things	0
like	0
abortion	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
so	0
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
how	1
i	1
judge	1
there's	0
a	0
few	1
things	1
where	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
say	0
yes	1
or	0
no	1
like	0
abortion	1
or	0
gun	1
control	1
or	0
let	0
me	0
see	0
i	0
try	0
to	0
look	1
at	0
what	1
if	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
newspaper	1
articles	1
or	0
the	1
i	0
don't	0
trust	1
tv	1
as	0
much	1
but	0
newspaper	1
articles	1
can	1
show	1
wheth[er]	0
how	0
they	0
voted	1
in	0
the	0
past	1
and	0
but	0
you	0
get	0
you	0
know	0
it	0

right	0

it	0
all	0
depends	1
again	1
on	0
whose	0
writing	1
it	0
and	0
who	1
they're	0
for	1
because	0
they	0
can	0
slant	1
that	0
too	1

right	0
and	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
poli[ticians]	0
the	0
politicians	0
i'm	0
the	0
also	1
the	0
politicians	1
put	0
out	1
what	0
makes	1
them_1	0
look	0
good	0
anyway	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
everybody's	1
got	1
you	0
know	1
stuff	1
they	0
don't	1
want	0
known	1

right	0
everybody's	1
got	1
a	1
secret	1
so	0

well	0
anyway	1
i'm	0
sorry	1
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	1
have	1
much	1
knowledge	1

well	0
that's	0
okay	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
um	0

i	0
don't	0
even	0
remember	0
this	1
being	0
on	0
there	1

i	0
mean	1
what	0
would	1
it	0
take	1
like	1
that	1
this	1
is	0
really	0
good	1
actually	1
tha[t]	0
for	1
to	0
talk	1
to	0
somebody	1
who	0
hasn't	0
voted	1
i	0
mean	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0

incentive	0

how	0
would	0
it	1
how	1
what	0
kind	1
of	0
stuff	1
would	0
they	1
would	0
you	1
like	0
them	0
to	0
do	1
so	0
that	1
that	1
you	0
would	1
know	0
more	1
about	0
it	1
like	0
send	0
stuff	0
in	0
the	0
mail	0
or	0
have	0
it	0
at	0
the	0
library	0
or	0

i	0
guess	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
good	0
now	0
i'm	0
sure	1
they've	0
got	0
it	0
at	0
the	0
library	1
you	1
know	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0
if	0
i	0
get	0

the	0
library	1
i've	0
got	1
two	0
babies	1
so	0
i	0

tie	1
you	0
down	0

little	0
bit	1

but	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0

or	1
do	0
you	1
just	0
not	1
do	0
you	0
feel	1
like	0
it's	1
not	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
make	1
that	0
much	0
difference	1
if	0
you	0
don't	0
vote	1
or	0

oh	0
i	0
know	1
if	0
enough	0
people	1
think	0
like	0
that	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
would	0
make	1
a	0
difference	0
if	0
people	1
stopped	0
thinking	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

yeah	0

um	0
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
they'll	0
vote	1
the	0
way	1
their	0
family	1
votes	0
you	0
know	1
if	0

uh-huh	0

if	0
since	0
you're	1
what	0
democrat	1
th[en]	1
then	1
like	0
your	0
kids	1
or	0
whatever	0
will	0
follow	0
you	1
and	0
just	0
vote	0
democrat	1
right	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

right	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0

well	0
not	0
in	0
my	0
[laughter-family]	0

no	0

we're	0
kind	1
of	0
really	1
independent	1

all	0
split	0

but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
families	0
do	0
that	1
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
wives	1
feel	1
like	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
vote	1
the	0
way	0
that	0
their	0
husbands	0
vote	1

right	0

and	0
that	0
kind	1
of	0
keeps	1
from	0
getting	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
issues	1
resolved	1
golly	0

i	0
lie	0
hm	0

but	0
well	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	1
did	1
understand	0
politics	1
i	0
probably	1
would	0
vote	0
more	1

um-hum	0

but	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
if	0
i	0
voted	0
for	0
bush	0
or	0
like	1
when	0
uh	0
gary	1
hart	1
was	0
running	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	0
would	0
have	0
voted	1
for	0
him	1
just	0
because	1
he	0
was	0
nicer	0
looking	1
not	0

hart	0

uh-huh	0

not	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
was	0
good	0
looking	0
but	0
he	0
was	0
young	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

and	0
then	1
i	0
didn't	1
think	0
that	1
was	0
right	1
because	0
he	0
may	1
have	0
been	0
a	0
good	0
president	1
or	0
whatever	1

um-hum	0

but	0
because	0
it	0
was	0
he	0
had	0
an	0
affair	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
it	0
just	1
threw	0
him	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
whole	1
running	0

yeah	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
go	1
by	0
their	1
uh	0
personal	1
life	0
when	0
they	0
vote	1
and	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

which	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
got	0
turmoil	1
in	0
your	1
personal	1
life	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
let	1
it	0
come	1
into	0
work	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
that	0
have	1
had	0

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
everybody	0
does	0
it	0
just	0
depends	1
on	0
how	0
well	1
you	0
can	0
hide	1
it	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i	0
that's	0
very	0
true	0
i	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
doesn't	1
really	0
have	1
that	0
much	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
um	0
unless	1
they've	0
done	1
something	0
really	0
horrible	1
you	0
know	1
or	0
something	1
real	0
abnormal	1

well	0

criminal	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that's	0
different	0
but	0

yeah	0
right	0

but	0
if	0
him	1
and	0
his	0
wife	1
weren't	0
getting	0
along	1
i	0

but	0
otherwise	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	1
what	0
is	1
what	1
effect	0
does	0
that	0
have	1
on	0
him	0
running	1
for	0
president	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1

yeah	0
yeah	0

it's	0
all	0
so	0
secretive	0
see	0
we	0
really	1
don't	0
see	1
the	0
true	1
person	1
anyway	0

that's	0
right	0

i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	0
having	1
a	0
big	1
effect	0
on	0
how	1
poorly	1
that	0
the	0
country's	1
being	0
run	1
is	0
that	1
um	0
the	1
the	0
election	1
the	0
people	1
that	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
elected	1
are	0
turning	1
it	0
into	0
a	0
popularity	1
contest	1
by	0
advertising	1
the	0
things	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
that	0
really	1
don't	0
have	0
anything	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
how	0
well	1
they	0
do	0
the	0
job	1

right	0

but	0
see	0
they're	0
trying	1
to	0
find	0
an	0
excuse	1
not	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
what	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
issues	1
that	0
people	1
really	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
about	1
because	1
on	0
those	0
issues	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
say	0
yes	1
or	0
no	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
don't	1
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	1
then	1
maybe	0
somebody'll	1
vote	1
for	0
them_1	0
that	0
wouldn't	1
have	1
if	0
they	0
had	0
come	1
down	0
on	0
the	0
wrong	0
side	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
so	0

right	0

so	0
they	0
just	0
try	0
and	0
make	0
it	0
a	0
personal	0
thing	0
i	0
mean	0
if	0
you	1
remember	1
any	1
of	0
the	0
tv	0
commercials	1
from	0
the	0
last	1
presidential	0
campaign	1
they	0
all	0
had	1
uh	0
pictures	1
of	0
bush	1
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
walking	1
around	0
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
and	1
even	0
from	0
reagan	1
it	0
was	0
all	1
just	0
like	1
looks	1
like	0
a	0
mcdonald's	1
commercial	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	0

that's	1
[laughter-about]	0
what	0
it	0
looked	1
like	0

well	1
what	0
did	1
you	0
think	1
of	0
reagan	0
as	0
a	0
president	1

i	0
just	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
really	0
inept	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
he	0
did	0
anything	1
at	0
all	1
he	1
they	0
just	1
kind	0
of	0
sat	1
him	0
up	0
there	1
like	0
a	0
puppet	1
and	0
the	0
people	0
that	0
were	0

do	0
you	0
think	1
he	0
won	1
from	0
carter	1
because	1
of	0
the	1
um	0
the	1
hostages	1
that	0
were	0
held	1
at	0
that	0
time	1

well	0
i	1
think	0
that	0
was	1
part	1
of	0
it	1
i	0
think	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
the	0
the	0
economic	0
problems	0
that	0
the	0
country	1
was	0
having	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
the	0
the	0
recession	0
and	0
stuff	0
people	1

um-hum	0

people	1
just	0
had	0
a	0
picture	0
of	0
carter	1
as	0
not	0
being	0
real	0
capable	1
but	0
he	0
actually	0
all	0
right	0
[laughter-this]	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	0

i	0
thought	1
carter	0
was	0
good	0
too	1
and	0
that	0
was	0
yeah	0

did	0
you	0
i	0
always	0
liked	0
him	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
couldn't	1
get	0
over	1
the	0
fact	0
that	0
reagan	1
beat	0
him	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
i	0
just	1
couldn't	0
believe	1
that	0
he	1
got	0
voted	0
out	1

but	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
wasn't	0
well	0
let's	0
see	0
that's	0
been	0
about	1
ten	0
years	0
ago	0
right	1

um-hum	0

so	0
i	0
was	0
only	0

in	1
the	0
hospital	1
for	1
about	1
fifteen	1
years	1
and	0
i've	1
taken	1
care	1
of	0
a	1
few	1
aids	1
patients	0

uh-huh	0

um	1
when	0
they	1
asked	1
us	1
did	1
did	1
we	1
want	1
to	0
um	0
keep	1
it	1
the	0
same	1
or	0
uh	0
spend	1
more	0
or	0
spend	1
less	1
i	1
think	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
right	0
now	1
w[hat]	0
what	0
they're	0
spending	1
is	0
adequate	1
uh	0
my	0
for	0
my	0
personal	1
opinion	1
um	0
because_1	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
something	1
that's	0
gonna	0
take	1
them_1	0
a	0
while	1
to	0
come	0
up	1
with	0
a	0
uh	0
vaccine	1
for	1
i	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
don't	0
think	1
it's	0
gonna	0
be	0
that	0
easy	0
to	0
come	0
up	1
with	0
or	0

yeah	0

or	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
already	0
would	1
have	0
by	0
now	1
you	0
know	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
um	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
if	0
spending	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
money	1
would	0
really	1
make	0
any	0
difference	1
right	0
now	0
i	0
think	1
they're	0
doing	1
the	0
is	0
as	0
much	1
research	1
as	0
they	0
can	0
possibly	1
do	1
you	0
know	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
what	0
about	0
you	1

well	1
i	0
guess	1
i'm	0
not	1
too	1
aware	1
of	0
how	1
much	0
they're	0
spending	1
right	0
[laughter-now]	0
you	0
know	1

i'm	1
not	0
either	1
i'm	0

i'm	0
definitely	1
not	0
aware	1
of	0
how	0
much	1

yeah	1

uh	0
it's	0
something	0
i've	0
never	1
really	0
kept	0
up	1
with	0
at	0
all	1

uh-huh	0
yeah	0

um	0
i	0
don't	0
kn[ow]	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
uh	0
i	0

i	1
mean	0
i	0
go	0
ahead	1
um-hum	0

i	0
know	1
uh	0
i've	1
always	0
thought	1
more	0
about	0
the	0
disease	1
rather	0
than	0
the	0
research	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
i	0
mean	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

and	0
uh	0
that	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	1
um	0
if	0
if	0
we	0
were	0
talking	1
about	0
the	0
money	1
um	0
i'd	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
say	1
what	1
they're	0
spending	1
is	0
probably	0
enough	1
simply	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
much	0
about	1
it	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	0
can	0
see	1
that	0
research	1
is	0
needed	1
and	0
you	1
know	0

oh	0
yeah	1

definitely	1

i	0
think	0
so	1
i	0
think	0
so	1

i	0
mean	0
it's	0
becoming	1
a	0
major	0
problem	1

yeah	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
guess	0
the	0
area	0
that	0
i	1
think	0
more	0
about	1
is	0
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	1
them	0
focus	1
on	0
uh	0
preventing	1
it	0
uh	0
in	0
more	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

well	0
that's	0
true	1
that's	0
true	1
because	0
um	0
it's	0
a	0
such	1
an	0
easily	0
preventable	1
disease	0

right	1
and	0
i	0
i	1
feel	0
like	0
just	0
saying	1
uh	0
safe	1
sex	0
is	0
not	1
the	0
answer	1
it's	0

um	0

it's	0
it's	0
uh	0
abstinence	1
in	0
certain	0
cases	1
and	0

no	1
it's	0

it's	0
definitely	1
not	1

and	0

that's	1
true	1
that's	1
true	1

yeah	1

um	1

and	0
knowing	1
you	0
know	1

myself	1
um	0
um	0
i'm	0
just	0
recently	1
or	0
about	1
to	0
get	0
a	0
divorce	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
course	0
i'm	1
not	0
all	1
ready	1
to	0
just	0
run	0
out	1
there	0
and	0
start	0
dating	1
everybody	0
i	0
can	1
or	0
anything	1

yeah	1

but	1
it's	0
sort	0
of	0
scary	1
to	0
find	0
yourself	0
single	1
again	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
because	0
you	0
never	1
know	0
what's	0
gonna	0
happen	1
you	1
don't	0
know	0
who	1
you're	0
gonna	0
come	0
across	1
you	0
know	1
course	0

yeah	1

course	0
it's	0
it's	0
not	1
that	0
i'm	1
wanting	1
to	0
i'm	1
not	0
gonna	0
wanting	0
to	0
go	1
and	0
have	0
sex	1
with	0
[laughter-everybody]	0
i	0
see	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
it's	0
something	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
think	1
about	0
these	0
days	1

yeah	1

a	0
single	0
person	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
certainly	1
changed	0
my	1
attitude	1
about	0
that	1
in	0
a	0
hurry	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

and	0
um	0

i	1
think	0
for	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
it	0
has	1

certainly	1

so	1

yeah	1

so	0

but	0
um	0
uh	0
i	0
know	1
that	0
uh	0
in	0
some	0
of	1
these	0
larger	1
cities	1
they're	0
passing	1
out	0
free	1
syringes	1
and	0
all	0
of	0
that	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	0
to	0
prevent	1
you	1
know	0
so	0
that	0
uh	0
the	0
drug	1
addicts	0
won't	0
be	0
getting	0
dirty	0
needles	1
and	0
everything	1

uh-huh	0

drug	1
addicts	0

um-hum	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
that's	1
a	0
bad	0
idea	1

uh-huh	0

i	0
know	1
it	0
uh	0
sort	0
of	0
doesn't	1
address	0
the	0
problem	1
of	0
drug	1
addiction	0

yeah	1

it	0
just	0
sort	0
of	0
keeps	0
that	1
going	0

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
at	0
least	1
drug	1
addiction	0
can	0
be	0
treated	1
whereas	0
aids	1
so	0
far	1
cannot	1
be	0
you	0
know	0
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
that's	1
i'm	1
not	0
t[oo]	0
too	0
much	0
against	1
the	0
the	0
passing	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
free	1
syringes	1
myself	1

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0
about	0
that	1

well	1
yeah	1
boy	1
th[at's]	0
that's	1
a	0
hard	1
issue	1

it's	0
it	0
really	1
is	1
it	0

it	0
really	1
is	0

it	0
really	1
is	0
they	0
gave	1
us	0
a	0
hard	0
topic	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	1
i	0
i	0
definitely	1
think	1
that	0
it's	0
the	0
drug	1
problem	0
that	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
addressed	1
but	0
as	1
you	0
say	1
um	0
people	1
i	1
mean	0
in	0
the	0
meantime	1
well	1
someone	1
who's	0
not	1
ready	0
to	0
give	0
up	0
drugs	1
um	0
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

that's	0
true	1

that's	0
true	1

if	0
they're	0
per[petrating]	1
perpetrating	1
the	0
aids	1
problem	1
passing	1
that	1
on	0
to	0
each	0
other	1
then	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
consider	1
the	0
two	1
problems	1
drug	1
addiction	0
an	0
aids	1
aids	1
would	0
have	0
to	0
have	0
come	0
first	1
i	0
guess	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
something	1
to	0
uh	0
to	0
do	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	0

so	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
um	0
course	0
there's	1
so	1
many	0
things	1
in	0
the	0
world	1
where	0
if	0
you	0
solve	1
one	1
problem	0
you	0
may	1
be	0
creating	0
another	1
you	0
know	1

[laughter-yeah]	0

and	0
uh	0
so	0
i	0
guess	1
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
two	0
problems	1
and	0
see	0
which	0
is	0
worse	1
and	0
which	0
is	0
the	0
most	1
important	0
to	0
solve	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
don't	0
know	1

yeah	1

but	0
um	0
but	0
i've	0
never	1
looked	0
into	0
how	0
much	0
money	1
they're	0
spending	0
i	0
have	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
our	0
tax	1
money	0
goes	1
to	0
that	0

yeah	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
really	0
have	0
never	1
looked	0
into	0
it	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1

yeah	0
i	0
haven't	1
either	1
i've	0
heard	1
you	1
know	0
uh	0
different	1
voices	1
speaking	0
up	1
and	0
saying	1
we're	1
not	0
spending	0
enough	1
and	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

and	0
mostly	1
that's	0
what	0
i've	0
heard	1
so	0

right	1
sure	1

so	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0

yeah	1

and	0
yet	0
i	0
know	1
it's	0
um	0
it	0
sounds	1
like	0
big	0
money	0
to	0
me	1

yeah	1
i	0

but	1
it	0
probably	1
takes	1
a	0
lot	0

i	0
think	0
it	0
is	1
i	0

i	0
think	0
it	0
is	1

yeah	1
it	0
does	1
every	0
it	0

so	0

it	0
seems	1
to	0
take	0
more	0
than	0
uh	0
for	0
any	1
little	0
thing	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
seems	0
to	0
take	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
money	1
that	0
you	0
would	0
think	0
it	0
would	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

but	0
uh	0

did	0
you	1
have	0
any	0
fear	1
working	0
in	0
the	0
hospital	1
with	0
that	0

that's	0
one	1
thing	0
i've	0
never	1
really	0
feared	1

uh-huh	0

um	0
uh	0
i	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
my	0
family	1
you	0
know	1
they	1
fear	1
me	0
working	1
like	0
that	1
and	0
under	0
some	1
some	0
of	0
those	0
conditions	1
but	0
um	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
fear	0
it	0
at	0
all	1

um-hum	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
i	0
work	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
operating	1
room	0
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

and	1
um	0
and	0
of	0
course	1
when	0
we	0

are	1
you	1
there	1

um-hum	1

okay	1
now	0
tell	1
me	0
your	1
favorite	1
team	1

uh	0
baseball	1

yes	1

well	1
i've	0
been	1
kind	0
of	0
been	0
intrigued	1
with	0
the	0
rangers	1
uh	1
more	1
so	1
with	1
uh	0
uh	0
their	0
management	1
than	0
anything	0
else	1
i'd	0
i	0
don't	1
follow	0
baseball	1
that	0
that	1
closely	1
but	1
uh	0
si[nce]	1
you	1
know	1
since	1
i	0
live	1
here	1
so	0
close	1
to	0
arlington	1
uh	1
that's	1
the	0
team	1
that	1
i've	0
been	1
kind	0
of	1
following	1

okay	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
a	0
little	1
bit	0
late	1
in	1
the	0
season	1
for	0
them	1
to	0
assign	1
us	1
where	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
they're	1
headed	1
so	1
we'll	1
have	0
to	0
talk	1
about	0
the	0
future	1
with	0
the	0
rangers	1

um-hum	0

right	1

what	0
are	1
your	1
thinkings	1
on	0
what	1
they	0
can	0
do	1
what	1
they'll	0
be	1
able	1
to	0
do	0

well	1
i	1
think	0
that	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
with	0
uh	0
so	0
much	1
controversy	1
over	1
ruben	1
sierra	1
not	0
signing	1
and	1
asking	1
us	0
for	0
so	0
much	1
money	1
it's	1
um	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
i'm	1
not	0
real	1
sure	1
about	0
th[at]	1
do	0
you	0
know	1
anything	0
about	1
ruben	0
sierra's	1
uh	0

well	0
i	1
heard	1
tonight	1
on	1
the	0
news	1
that	1
he	1
is	0
willing	1
to	1
come	0
down	1
on	1
his	1

yeah	1
that	0
he	0
was	0
willing	1
to	0
come	0
down	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	0
uh	0
if	0
the	0
rangers	1
will	0
go	0
up	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
yeah	1

yes	1

and	0
the	0
rangers	1
go	0
up	1
a	0
[laughter-little]	0
bit	1
um-hum	0

but	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
from	0
three	1
you	0
know	1
from	0
thirty	1
million	1
dollars	1
or	0
thirty	0
five	1
mill[ion]	0
that's	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
money	1

i	1
think	1
the	1
entire	1
baseball	1
yeah	1
they're	1
the	0
ones	1
that	0
probably	1
are	0
paying	1
the	0
highest	1

yeah	1
they	1
are	0

and	1
i	1
think	1
this	0
is	0
absolutely	1
ridiculous	1

um-hum	0

no	1

and	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
that	0
uh	0
that	0
they	1
ought	1
to	1
i'm	1
not	0
real	0
sure	1
that	0
they	1
should	0
pay	1
him	0
that	0
much	0
money	1
i	1
think	1
they	0
should	1
uh	1
uh	0
pay	1
him	1
what	1
his	0
salary's	1
going	0
to	0
be	1
uh	0
and	1
let	1
him	0
because	0
he's	0
got	0
one	1
more	0
year	1
before	0
he	0
turns	0
into	1
a	0
a	0
free	0
agent	1

that's	0
right	1

and	0
then	1
uh	0
who	0
knows	1
if	0
he	0
produces	1
next	0
year	1
they	1
may	0
have	0
to	0
end	0
up	0
paying	0
him	0
anyway	1
but	0
if	0
he	0
doesn't	1
then	0
his	0
market	1
value	0
will	0
go	0
down	1
and	0
they	0
can	0
pick	0
him	0
up	0
for	0
for	0
a	0
lot	0
less	1
than	0
than	0
they	0
would	1
uh	0
if	0
they	0
paid	1
him	0
the	0
si[x]	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
six	0
million	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
this	1
year	0

what	0
i	1
saw	0
on	0
the	0
news	1
today	1
that	0
bue[chele]	0
buechele	1
was	0
back	1
just	0
to	0
visit	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	1
awful	1
sorry	1
he's	1
not	0
still	1

oh	0
yeah	1
but	0
you	1
know	0
what	1
he	1
that	1
was	0
a	0
great	1
deal	1
for	0
him	1

oh	0
i'm	0
sure	1
it	0
was	0

yeah	1
it	1
was	0
a	0
great	1
deal	0
for	0
him	1
and	0
and	0
uh	1
he	1
just	0
signed	0
on	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
was	0
like	1
a	0
five	1
year	0
deal	1
with	0
uh	0
pittsburgh	1
so	0

pittsburgh	1

yeah	1

so	0
you	1
know	0
he's	1
real	0
happy	0
there	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
the	0
rangers	1
are	0
concerned	0
i	1
think	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
need	1
some	0
definitely	1
need	0
some	0
pitching	1

yes	1
sir	0

uh	0
and	0
so	1
i	0
you	1
know	0
i	0

well	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
of	0
howse	1
who	1
is	0
the	0
coach	1
for	0
the	0
pitchers	1

the	0
pitching	1

a	0
a	0
black	1
guy	0

helping	0
out	1
uh	0

uh	0
he	0
has	1
been	0
really	1
aggressive	1
at	0
especially	1
towards	0
my	0
little	0
girl	1
for	0
some	1
reason	0

huh	0

he's	0
uh	0
been	0
so	1

to	0
her	0

mean	1
to	0
her	1
um	0
right	0
after	1
we	0
first	0
got	1
him	0
so	0
we	0
had	1
him	0
neutered	1
and	0
and	0
declawed	1
and	0
now	1
he	0
bites	1
her	0
[laughter-he]	0
[laughter-can't]	1
scratch	1
her	0
[laughter-anymore]	0
he	0

huh	0

he	0

he	0
has	1
a	0
couple	0
of	0
times	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

a	0
very	1
possessive	1
cat	1
he	0
he	1
loves	1
my	0
son	1
it's	0
his	1
cat	1
and	1
he's	0
the	0
only	1
one	1
that	0
allows	1
him	0
to	0
touch	1
him	0
or	0
pet	1
him	0
or	0
love	1
him	0

guess	1
well	0
as	0
long	1
as	0

i	0
guess	1
with	0
the	0
daughter	1
he's	0
all	1
right	0
you	0

yeah	1

you	0
wouldn't	0
want	1
him	0

her	0
off	1
or	0
something	0

yeah	1
well	0
we	1
we	0
did	1
uh	1
actually	0
take	0
him	0
to	0
the	0
pound	1
a	0
couple	0
of	0
times	1
you	0
know	1
because_1	0
we	1
just	0
couldn't	0
have	1
him	0
being	0
so	1
so	0
aggressive	1
towards	0
the	0
girl	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

sure	1

but	0
uh	0
he	0
seems	1
to	0
have	0
mellowed	0
out	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	0
we	0
do	1
keep	1
our	0
daughter	1
away	1
from	0
him	0
so	0

yeah	1
yeah	0

were	1
it	0
not	1
for	0
my	0
son	1
the	0
cat	1
would	0
not	0
be	1
in	0
this	0
house	1

is	0
that	1
the	0
only	1
pet	0
that	0
you	0
have	1

it	1
is	1
uh-huh	0
we've	0
we	0
tried	1
a	0
dog	1
um	0
about_1	1
four	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
we	0
ended	0
up	1
with	0
a	0
oh	1
malamute	1
and	0
some	1
other	1
kind	0
of	0
mix	1
anyway	1
it	0
was	0
it	1
ended	1
up	1
being	0
just	1
a	0
huge	1
huge	0
dog	1
that	0
ate	1
us	0
out	0
of	0
house	1
and	0
home	1
so	0
we	0
gave	0
him	1
up	0
and	0
tried	0

well	0
do	0
you	0
live	1
you	0
you	1
in	0
a	1
house	1
or	0
a	1
place	1
where	0
you	1
uh	1

yes	1
uh-huh	0
we're	1
in	0
a	0
house	1
but	0
we're	0
in	0
a	0
subdivision	1
where	0
we	0
really	1
can't	0
allow	0
the	0
dog	1
we	0

i	1
see	0

we	0
couldn't	0
allow	1
him	0
to	0
run	0
free	1
so	0
he	1
was	0
just	0
chained	0
up	1
all	0
the	0
time	0
and	0
it	1
was	0
it	0
was	0
unfortunate	1

sure	1

so	0
have	0
you	0
tried	1
any	0
other	0
pets	1

no	1
no	0
i	0
i	1
live	0
alone	1
in	0
an	0
apartment	1
and	0
uh	0
it's	0
it's	0
not	1
that	0
big	1
that	0
uh	0

oh	1

although	1
i've	0
heard	1
rabbits	1
are	0
pretty	1
good	0

oh	1

you	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
saw	1
something	0
on	0
cnn	1
or	0
on	0
cable	1
here	0
uh	0
a	0
while	1
ago	1
that	0
showed	0
some	0
people	1
that	0
had	0
rabbits	1
in	0
apartments	0
and	0
in	0
houses	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

oh	1
my	0

oh	1
my	0
word	1

uh	0

they	0
they	0
just	0
paper	1
train	0
it	0
or	0
something	1

i	0
[laughter-guess]	1

i	0
guess	1
yeah	0
and	0
i	1
would	1
imagine	1
that	0
they	0
don't	0
have	0
many	0
more	0
than	0
one	1
to	0
start	1
with	1
either	0
because_1	0

yeah	1
well	0

darling	1
that	0
would	0
be	0
fun	1
if	0

they're	0
pretty	0
smelly	1

getting	0
so	1
many	0
calls	1
to	0
texas	1

this	1
is	0
the	0
very	1
first	1
one	1
i've	0
i've	0
talked	1
to	0
you	0

uh-huh	0

okay	1
eric	1
um	1
are	1
you	0
married	1
and	0
do	1
you	1
have	1
a	0
family	1

uh	1
yes	1
i	1
am	1
to	0
uh	0
both	1
questions	1

okay	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
and	0
your	0
wife	1
have	1
a	0
budget	1
plan	1
for	1
your	1
finances	1

uh	0
yeah	1
we	0
do	1
we	1
um	1
uh	0
basically	1
there's	0
the	0
you	1
know	0
expenses	1
that	1
are	0
fixed	1
during	0
the	0
month	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
ones	1
that	0
come	0
every	1
every	0
month	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
we	1
uh	0
enter	1
those	0
into	0
uh	0
into	1
a	0
spread	1
sheet	0
and	0
uh	0
what's	0
ever	1
left	1
uh	0
after	0
that	1
we	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
we	0
sit	0
down	1
and	0
agree	1
on	0
kind	1
of	0
what	0
you	1
know	1
what	1
sort	1
of	0
range	1
we're	1
gonna	1
generally	1
gonna	1
shoot	1
for	0

uh-huh	1

okay	1
um	0
well	0

so	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
do	1

well	0
that's	1
basically	0
what	0
we	0
do	1
um	0
about	1
every	1
every	0
three	0
months	1
or	0
so	1
we	0
reevaluate	1
our	0
budget	1
and	0
we	0
sit	0
down	1
and	0
just	0
write	1
from	0
the	0
largest	1
bills	0
down	0
to	0
the	0
smallest	1

um-hum	0

and	1
then	1
we	0
divvy	1
them	0
up	1
between	1
our	0
four	0
pay	1
checks	0
i	0
work	0
part	1
time	0
at	0
night	1

[laughter-wow]	0

and	0
he	1
works	0
and	0
my	0
husband	1
works	0
full	0
time	0
days	1
and	0
so	0
we	1
have	0
the	0
four	1
pay	0
checks	0
with	1
that	0
works	1
out	0
nice	1
because	0
we	1
get	0
paid	1
every	0
week	1
and	1
so	0
that	1
does	0
help	1

yeah	1

that	1
helps	1
a	0
lot	1
and	0
then	1
um	0
we	1
don't	0
have	0
a	0
lot	1
ex[tra]	0
extra	1
for	1
extra	1
spending	1
so	0

so	0
it's	1
pretty	0
well	1
earmarked	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
all	0
allocated	1
out	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

yeah	1
ev[ery]	0
every	1
penny	1
is	0
earmarked	1
but	1
um	0
it	1
we	1
have	0
found	1
that	0
that	1
works	1
the	0
best	1
and	1
and	0
so	1
if	0
we	1
can	0
just	0
divide	1
them	0
up	0
all	1
the	0
major	1
bills	0
up	1
in	0
fact	1
we	1
found	0
it	0
easier	1
to	0
divide	0
the	0
major	1
bills	0
up	0
you	1
know	0
cut	1
the	0
house	1
payment	0
in	0
half	1
and	0
cut	1
the	1
loan	1
payment	1
in	0
half	1
and	0
and	1
divide	1
those	1
up	0
between	1
all	1
um-hum	0

all	1
the	0
checks	1
yeah	1

and	0
so	1
we	1
are	0
not	1
taking	1
a	0
huge	1
sum	1
out	0
out	0
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
next	1
pay	0
check	0
we're	0
real	1
short	1
or	1

right	1
yeah	1
we	1
found	0
that	0
um	0
it's	0
definitely	1
helped	0
uh	0
get	1
a	0
handle	1
on	0
kind	1
of	0
the	0
unnecessary	1
expenses	1

that's	1
true	1

we	1
were	1
before	1
we	1
started	1
doing	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
a	1
thing	1
we	0
were	0
um	0
spending	1
uh	0
money	1
for	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
know	1
we	0
probably	1
tended	0
to	0
eat	1
out	1
a	0
bit	0
more	1
than	0
the	0
than	1
we	0
should	1
have	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
easy	1
to	0
uh	0
let	1
things	0
get	0
out	0
of	0
hand	1
we	1
thought	0
it	0
uh	0
thought	1
it	0
to	0
be	0
really	0
helpful	1
we've	0
gotten	1
some	0
of	0
our	0
loans	1
paid	0
off	0
early	1
because	1
of	0
this	0
and	0
and	0
stuff	1
like	0
that	1
so	0

yeah	0

so	0

well	1
it	0
helps	1
you	0
to	0
focus	1
where	1
your	0
money	0
goes	1

yeah	0

and	1
and	0
i'm	0
sure	1
you	1
felt	0
the	0
s[ame]	0
the	0
same	1
frustration	1
before	1
you	0
got	0
on	0
a	0
budget	1
but	0
you're	0
wondering	1
my	0
when	0
you	0
put	1
down	0
all	1
the	0
money	0
that	0
you	0
do	1
bring	0
in	0
and	1
then	0
you're	0
saying	1
my	0
word	1
where	0
did	0
all	1
that	1
money	1
go	1

that's	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
money	1
but	0

where	1
does	0
it	0
go	1

yeah	0

huh	0

and	0
also	1
we	1
have	0
found	1
that	0
if	1
we	0
write	1
down	1
a[nd]	0
and	0
we	1
did	1
this	0
we're	1
not	0
real	1
consistent	1
with	0
this	0
but	0
we	0
did	1
it	0
for	0
about	0
a	0
month	1
and	0
we	1
wrote	0
down	0
everything	1
that	0
we	0
bought	1
with	0
you	1
know	0
every	0
paycheck	1

um-hum	0

and	0
so	0
we	1
could	0
see	1
where	0
every	1
penny	0
went	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
really	0
interesting	1
to	0
see	1
just	1
what	0
you	0
do	1
spend	0
and	0
and	1
like	0
i	0
say	1
we	0
haven't	1
been	0
real	0
consistent	1
with	0
it	0
it's	0
we	0
should	1
because_1	1
it	0
does	1
help	1

yeah	1
the	0
other	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
that	0
that	0
we've	1
found	0
that	0
that	0
helps	1
if	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
tend	0
to	0
fudge	1
on	0
the	0
budget	1
a	0
little	1
bit	0
it's	0

uh-huh	1

it's	0
just	0
to	1
[laughter-uh]	0
uh	0
get	0
out	1
the	0
money	1
in	0
advance	1
and	0
put	0
it	0
in	1
uh	0
um	0
so	0
long	1
as	0
it	0
wasn't	1
you	1
know	0
unreasonably	1
high	0
but	0
for	0
things	1
like	0
food	1
expenses	0
or	0
or	0
whatever	1
just	0
put	1
it	0
in	0
a	0
in	0
an	0
envelope	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
that	1
way	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
forced	1
us	0
to	0
uh	0
stick	1
to	0
that	0
amount	1
and	0
then	0
once	1
that	0
was	0
gone	1
well	1
if	0
the	0
entertainment	1
amount	0
was	0
gone	1
for	0
the	0
month	1
oh	0
it's	0
gone	1

just	1
stick	0
to	0
that	1
uh-huh	0
that	0
is	1

yeah	0
that	0
that	1
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
really	1
good	0
idea	0

so	0

and	0
it	0
really	1
helpful	1
um	1
have	1
you	0
developed	1
a	0
savings	1
plan	1
or	0
iras	1
or	0
anything	1
like	0
that	1
yet	1

we	1
we	1
haven't	0
we	1
our	0
our	0
initial	1
goal	0
was	0
just	1
to	0
retire	1
our	0
debt	1
uh	0
completely	1
retire	0
our	1
debt	1
for	0
car	1
payments	1
and	0
credit	1
card	1
uh	0
credit	1
card	1
debt	1
and	1
and	0
all	1
of	1
that	1
and	1

oh	0
uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
we're	1
just	0
at	1
a	0
point	1
where	0
where	0
we	1
could	0
start	0
thinking	1
about	0
it	0
so	0

oh	0
that's	1
good	1
that's	1
a	0
good	0
feeling	1

yeah	1
i	0

my	0
husband	1
just	0
graduated	1
from	0
the	0
university	1
uh	0
a	0
year	1
ago	1

um-hum	0

so	0
finally	1
finally	1
we	1
are	1
getting	1
to	1
that	0
point	0
too	1

a	0
study	1

so	1
are	0
you	1
still	0
going	0
to	0
school	0
or	1

yeah	0
yeah	1
i'm	0
actually	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
mas[ter]	1

the	1
aids	1
issue	1
is	0
is	0
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
problem	1
i	0
guess	1
the	0
first	1
thing	0
that	0
comes	0
to	1
my	1
mind	0
not	1
having	0
any	0
immediate	1
friends	1
with	0
that	1
problem	0
is	0
is	1
the	0
financial	1
end	0
i	0
mean	1
how	1
can	0
a	0
country	1
stand	1
to	0
uh	0
spend	0
as	0
much	1
or	0
much	0
more	1
than	0
they	0
already	0
are	1
on	0
such	0
a	0
problem	1
uh	0
but	0
then	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thinking	1
is	0
also	0
tempered	1
with	0
the	1
the	0
knowledge	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
the	0
the	0
rumor	1
i'm	0
not	0
really	0
sure	1
if	0
it's	0
true	1
or	0
not	1
that	0
uh	0
we're	0
not	0
spending	1
as	0
much	1
per	1
let's	0
say	1
afflicted	1
person	1
on	0
cancer	1
uh	0
there's	0
some	1
uh	0
take	0
breast	1
cancer	0
for	0
instance	1
it	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
doing	0
much	1
more	0
damage	1
and	0
affecting	0
much	1
more	0
peo[ple]	1
mean	0
more	0
people	1
than	0
aids	1
and	0
yet	1
uh	0
more	1
people	0
die	1
of	0
it	0
and	0
yet	0
the	0
funding	1
is	0
already	1
uh	0
exceeded	1
aids	1
has	0
more	0
money	1
than	0
uh	0
breast	1
cancer	0

and	1
well	1
that's	1
interesting	1
isn't	1
it	0
yeah	1

so	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	0
if	1
it's	0
true	1
i	0
i've	1
i've	0
always	1
heard	1
these	0
things	0
i've	0
never	0
bothered	1
to	0
dig	1
it	0
out	0
and	0
make	0
sure	1
but	0
uh	0
i've	0
heard	1
it	0
on	0
more	1
than	0
one	0
documentary	1
that	1
uh	0
they	0
were	0
complaining	1
that	1
whoever's	1
sitting	0
up	0
there	0
making	1
these	0
decisions	1
uh	0
or	0
whatever	0
institutions	1
raise	0
the	0
money	1
and	0
uh	1
it's	0
just	0
one	0
big	1
pr	1
campaign	1
that	0
yeah	0
we	0
think	0
that's	0
the	0
world's	1
worst	0
thing	1
so	0
let's	0
give	0
money	0
to	0
aids	1
and	0
yet	1
we've	0
had	0
breast	1
cancer	0
problems	0
for	0
years	1

right	1

and	1
it's	0
just	0
one	1
of	0
those	0
well	0
of	0
course	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
shows	1
i	0
saw	1
was	0
taking	1
it	0
from	0
the	0
angle	1
that	0
since	0
it	0
doesn't	0
effect	0
men	1
it's	0
not	0
gonna	0
get	0
funded	1
and	1
uh	0
having	0
thought	1
about	0
that	1
for	0
a	0
while	1

what	1
did	0
you	0
think	0
about	0
that	1
idea	0

well	1
i	1
i	0
kind	1
of	0
i	0
thought	1
well	1
that	0
that	1
might	0
be	0
possible	1
since	0
there	0
are	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
men	1
in	0
control	1
of	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
but	0
then	1
i	0
go[t]	1
i	1
got	0
to	0
thinking	1
the	0
the	0
number	0
one	0
killer	1
of	0
men	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
prostate	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
one	1
test	1
that	0
just	1
recently	1
got	0
developed	1
uh	0
a	0
blood	0
an[tigen]	1
antigen	1
uh	0
antibody	1
test	1
for	0
the	0
antigen	1
in	0
the	0
blood	1
and	0
that's	1
fairly	0
recent	1
and	0
yet	0
men	1
have	0
been	0
dying	0
from	0
prostate	1
cancer	0
for	0
years	1

they've	0
not	1
really	0
given	0
it	1
attention	0
either	1
yeah	1

so	1
it's	1
not	0
really	0
cure	1
f[or]	0
yeah	1
it's	1
not	0
uh	0
not	1
that	0
heavily	0
funded	1
either	1
and	0
that	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
major	1
uh	0
problems	1
that	0
men	1
have	0
in	0
the	0
realm	0
of	0
cancer	1
so	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	0
just	1
some	0
strange	1
public	1
opinion	1
as	0
to	0
who	0
they	1
want	0
to	0
give	1
to	0
um	0
be	1
it	0
through	1
different	1
organizations	1
march	0
of	0
dimes	1
type	1
uh	0
telethons	1
or	0
or	0
bicycle	1
rides	0
or	0
whatever	1
how	1
they	0
fund	1
whatever	1
um	0
illness	1
they	0
wish	1

right	1

it's	0
kind	1
of	0
hard	1
to	0
to	0
get	1
an	0
even	1
keel	1
on	0
that	1
i	0
mean	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	1
to	0
say	1
well	1
there's	1
you	0
know	0
a	0
hundred	0
thousand	1
per	0
year	1
affected	0
by	0
this	1
one	0
so	0
let's	0
give	0
it	0
this	1
amount	1
and	0
then	0
this	0
other	1
one's	0
only	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	0
so	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	1
and	1
and	0
just	0
keep	1
doling	1
it	0
out	0
that	1
way	0
or	0

well	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
glad	1
i'm	0
not	1
the	0
one	1
that's	1
that's	0
in	0
charge	1
of	1
of	0
making	1
those	1
decisions	1
they	1
uh	1
you	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
could	0
just	0
be	1
money	1
for	1
all	1
these	0
problems	1
because_1	1
they're	1
all	1
so	1
serious	1
you	1
know	1
i	0
mean	1
it's	0
not	1
so	0
serious	1
i	0
guess	1
until	1
it	0
affects	1
your	0
family	1
and	1
then	0
all	0
the	0
sudden	1
it's	1
the	0
most	1
important	1
thing	1

right	1

so	1
i	1
i	0
would	1
hate	1
to	1
have	0
that	0
responsibility	1
just	0
personally	1
but	1
but	0
then	0
again	1
we	0
really	1
we	0
really	0
do	1
have	0
it	0
as	1
a	1
society	1
just	1
decides	1
which	1
things	0
we	0
need	1
to	0
address	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
it	1
it	1
frightens	1
me	0
to	1
think	1
of	0
so	1
many	0
people	0
with	1
with	1
aids	0
and	0
with	1
cancer	1
and	1
many	1
of	0
those	0
things	0
um	0
if	1
they're	0
not	0
able	1
to	0
to	0
be	0
insured	1
then	0
the	0
country's	1
gonna	0
pay	1
for	1
it	0
one	1
way	1
or	0
the	0
other	1
whether	1
it's	0
through	0
prevention	1
or	0
or	1
treatment	1
or	1
you	1
know	0
just	1
uh	0
just	0
helping	1
the	0
people	0
when	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	0
to	0
take	1
care	0
of	0
themselves	1

right	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
one	0
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
we're	0
gonna	0
end	0
up	0
paying	1
for	0
it	0

that's	0
true	1

just	1

you	0
know	1
the	1
the	0
other	1
thought	1
that	0
i	0
had	1
um	0
i've	0
had	1
several	1
minutes	1
to	0
think	1
about	0
this	0
after	1
i	0
uh	0
while	1
i	0
was	0
finding	1
people	0
i	1
uh	0
i	0
could	0
think	1
about	0
the	0
topic	1
longer	1
than	0
the	0
person	0
that	0
receives	1
it	0
so	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
a	0
unfair	1
advantage	1
as	0
they	0
were	1
but	0

but	0
the	0
other	1
thing	0
that	0
i've	0
thought	1
of	0
on	0
this	1
is	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
there	0
isn't	1
enough	0
money	1
uh	0
in	0
our	0
economy	1
or	0
in	0
our	0
system	1
uh	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
there's	0
so	1
much	1
that	0
goes	1
to	0
things	0
that	0
don't	1
really	1
do	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	0
of	0
good	0
i	0
mean	1
yeah	1
they're	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
but	1
we	0
have	0
such	1
an	0
affluent	1
[s]ociety	1
society	1
that	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
if	0
we	1
took	0
a	0
little	1
from	0
here	1
and	0
there	0
and	0
the	0
other	1
if	0
we	0
might	1
wind	1
up	0
with	0
a	0
uh	0
cure	1
for	0
just	0
about	0
everything	1
of	0

just	1
change	1
our	0
p[riorities]	0

of	0
course	0
then	0
we	0
wouldn't	0
have	0
any	0
room	1
to	0
put	0
people	1
but	1
[laughter-that's]	0

right	1
just	1
change	1
our	0
priorities	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
ridiculous	1
figures	0
for	0
pizza	1
or	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
these	0
phenomenal	1
amount	0
of	0
dollars	1
spent	0
for	0
this	1
that	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
all	1
the	0
arts	1
that	0
that	0
are	0
nice	1
and	0
aesthetic	1
but	0
are	0
they	1
that	1
enhancing	1
for	0
the	1
m[asses]	0
for	0
the	1
masses	1
you	0
know	1
they	0

right	1

they	0
certainly	1
do	0
well	1
for	0
those	0
who	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
symphony	1
orchestra	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
but	0
uh	0
had	0
all	1
that	0
donation	1
and	0
time	1
and	0
labor	1
and	0
effort	1
gone	1
toward	0
something	0
else	1

do	0
you	0
have	1
any	0

sure	1
i	1
have	1
a	0
springer	1
spaniel	1
and	0
her	1
name	1
is	0
thumper	1
she's	1
about	0
seven	1
or	0
eight	1
years	0
old	1
i	1
got	1
her	1
for	0
christmas	1
from	1
my	1
family	1

we	0
lived	1
in	0
nebraska	1
i	1
like	1
to	0
hunt	1
and	0
uh	0
so	0
i	0
thought	1
that	0
if	1
i	0

a	1
good	1
hunting	1
dog	1
like	1
thumper	1
that	0
boy	1

the	0
greatest	1
greatest	0
um	1

through	0
two	1
generations	0
of	0
children	1
in	0
my	0
family	1
and	0
was	0
always	1
very	0
gentle	1

got	1
him	0
he	0
was	0
um	0
he	0
was	0
born	1
in	0
the	0
wild	1
like	0
in	0
a	0
in	1
a	0
shed	1
and	0
had	0
never	1
been	0
in	0
a	0
building	1
when	0
i	0
got	1
him	0
so	0

uh-huh	1

so	0
he	0
and	0
he's	0
he	0
he	0
must	1
be	0
part	1
cross	1
part	1
with	0
some	0
kind	0
of	0
desert	1
animal	0
because_1	0
he's	0
very	0
long	1
and	0
lanky	1
but	0
he's	0
a	0
very	1
tame	1
spoiled	1
house	1
cat	0
you	1
know	0
now	0
that	0
i've	1
had	0
him	0
for	0
seven	0
years	1

being	1
born	1
outside	1
you	0
didn't	1
have	0
any	1
problems	1
house	1
training	0
them	1

no	1
no	1

that's	1
good	1

he's	0
yeah	1
he's	0
great	1
and	0
uh	0
he's	0
uh	0
he's	0
really	0
spoiled	1
though	1
so	1
but	0
he's	1
really	1
big	1
so	1
lots	1
of	0
times	0
he	0
it	0
he	0
he	1
seems	0
to	0
get	0
in	0
fights	1
and	1
when	0
he	0
was	0
younger	1
i	0
think	0
he	0
started	1
them	0
and	0
now	1
i	0
think	1
he	0
barely	1
makes	1
it	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
gets	0
beat	1
up	0
even	0
though	0
he's	0
big	1
because_1	0
he's	0
pretty	1
much	0
overweight	1
and	0
comes	1
home	0
with	0
a	1
few	0
scratches	1
now	1
and	0
then	0

sure	1

and	0
older	1

yeah	1

well	0
we	1
went	0
to	0
a	0
uh	0
cat	1
show	0
at	0
the	0
plano	1
center	1
here	0
in	0
town	1
and	0
uh	1
we	1
thought	0
that	1
we	1
have	0
a	0
cat	1
now	1
but	0
we	1
thought	0
well	1
if	0
we	0
ever	1
get	0
another	1
cat	1
you	0
know	1
we'd	1
want	0
something	1
kind	1
of	0
unique	1
so	0
we	0
kind	1
of	0
looked	0
around	1
and	0
they	1
had	0
everything	1
from	0
hairless	1
cats	1
to	0
siamese	1
cats	1
and	0
persian	1
cats	1
and	1
we	1
sort	1
of	1
fell	1
in	0
love	1
with	1
the	0
uh	1
maine	1
coon	1
cats	1

oh	1
i've	0
seen	1
them	0
i	0

they're	1
huge	1

yeah	1
i	0
have	1
seen	0
them	1
they	1
um	0
weren't	1
they	0
they	1
were	0
actually	1
i	0
can't	0
remember	1
they	0
were	0
used	1
to	0
be	0
used	1
on	0
ships	1
and	1
in	0
for	0
for	0
mousers	1
you	0
know	1
so	0

oh	0

so	0
they're	0
very	0
nautical	1
too	1

i'll	0
be	1
darned	1
i	0
didn't	1
know	0
that	1

yeah	1
i	0
just	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
i'm	0
i	0
think	1
i'm	0
being	0
accurate	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
area	1
of	0
folklore	1
but	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	1

we[ll]	0
that's	1
interesting	1

yeah	1

we	0
kind	1
of	0
like	0
well	1
my	0
family	1
didn't	0
necessarily	0
like	0
like	1
them	0
as	0
much	0
as	0
i	1
did	0
but	0
the	0
manx	1
is	0
that	1
the	0
one	0
that	0
doesn't	0
have	0
a	0
tail	1
it	0

yeah	1

it	0
sort	0
of	0
has	0
a	1
bob	1
tail	0
i	1
kind	0
of	1
like	1
that	0
too	1
but	0

yeah	1
i'd	0

i'm	0
real	1
li[ke]	0
a	0
real	1
cat	0
lover	1
i'd	0
i'd	0
have	1
a	0
lot	0
more	0
cats	1
if	0
my	0
boyfriend	0
would	0
let	1
u[s]	0
let	1
me	0

he	1
doesn't	0
really	0
like	1
mine	1
let	0
alone	0
another	1
one	0

well	1
i'll	0
tell	1
you	0

interesting	0
story	1
about	0
how	1
i	0
got	0
my	0

and	0
then	0
i	0
suppose	1
our	0
five	1
minutes	0

i	0
uh	1
work	1
for	0
a	0
university	1
and	0
i	0
went	1
to	0
uh	0
omaha	1
nebraska	1
to	1
recruit	0
students	1
and	0
i	0
had	1
some	1
time	1
off	1
in	1
the	0
afternoon	1
so	0
i	1
went	1
to	0
a	0
a	0
pet	1
shop	0
and	0
i	0
saw	1
these	0
little	1
springer	0
spaniels	1

hm	0

and	1
so	0
i	0
decided	1
well	1
you	0
know	1
this	1
would	0
really	0
be	0
a	0
nice	1
dog	0
to	0
have	1
so	1
when	0
i	0
got	1
back	0
home	1
to	1
carney	1
nebraska	1
i	0
told	1
my	0
wife	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
said	1
you	0
know	1
this	1
is	0
just	0
a	0
i	0
i	0
can	0
just	0
hear	1
the	0
dog	0
crying	1
for	0
me	0
now	1

i	0
know	1
what	0
you	0
mean	1

and	0
and	0
christmas	1
is	0
coming	1
up	0
you	0
know	1
hint	1
hint	1
and	0
so	0
i	1
had	0
to	0
go	0
back	1
the	0
next	1
week	0
as	0
well	1
as	0
a	0
bunch	0
of	0
other	1
people	0
from	0
the	0
university	1
and	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
people	1
uh	0
that	0
we	0
went	1
with	0
uh	1
they	0
were	0
friends	1
of	0
ours	0
and	0
so	0
we	1
uh	0
got	1
to	0
omaha	1
and	0
i	0
decided	1
i'd	0
take	0
my	0
friend	1
over	0
and	0
show	1
him	0
the	0
dog	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
got	0
over	1
there	0
and	0
she	0
said	0
oh	1
that's	0
too	0
bad	1
the	0
dog	1
has	0
already	1
been	0
sold	1
and	0
i	0
didn't	0
realize	1
it	0
but	0
this	0
guy	1
had	0
somehow	1
worked	0
it	0
out	1
so	0
that	0
he	1
got	0
there	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
earlier	1
bought	1
the	0
dog	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
in	0
the	0
back	0
room	1
and	0
uh	0
so	0
that	0
night	1
we	0
had	0
a	0
reception	1
for	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
uh	0
potential	1
high	1
school	0
students	0
or	0
college	1
students	0
and	0
and	1
uh	0
he	1
had	0
the	0
dog	1
the	0
whole	0
time	1
in	0
his	0
room	1
and	0
and	0
i	1
had	0
no	0
idea	1
and	0
so	1
we	0
headed	1
back	0
to	0
carney	1
that	0
night	0
and	0
the	0
dog	0
rode	1
in	0
the	0
car	1
and	0
we	0
stopped	1
along	0
the	0
way	1
and	0
had	1
a	1
bite	0
to	1
eat	1
and	0
they	1
left	1
the	1
dog	1
in	0
the	1
car	1
and	1
i	1
guess	1
while	1
we	1
were	0
inside	1
eating	1
thumper	1
just	0
tore	0
the	0
heck	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
inside	1
of	1
the	0
car	1
and	1
uh	1
finally	1
we	0
made	1
it	0
back	1
to	1
uh	1
to	0
carney	1
and	0

okay	1
well	1
why	1
don't	1
you	0
start	1
because_1	1
it	1
said	1
i	1
was	0
suppose	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
do	0
you	1

do	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
elderly	1
relatives	1
currently	1
in	1
uh	1
in	0
a	1
nursing	1
home	0
now	1

yes	1
i	1
do	1

do	1
you	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
grandmother	1
she's	1
a	0
hundred	1
and	1
two	1

oh	1
my	0
gosh	1

she'll	0
be	0
a	0
hundred	0
and	0
three	1
in	0
august	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
we	0
decided	0
not	1
to	0
put	0
her	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
she	1
lives	0
with	1
my	1
mother	1
and	0
my	0
father	1
who	0
also	1
live	0
here	0
in	0
town	1
and	0
then	0
my	0
sister	1
takes	0
care	1
of	1
her	0

uh-huh	1

she	1
even	0
though	1
she	0
is	1
a	1
hundred	0
and	0
two	1
she	0
still	1
has	1
all	0
of	0
her	0
faculties	1

right	1

she	0
still	1
has	0
her	0
snap	1
she	0
takes	1
care	0
of	0
her	0
own	1
business	0
this	1
is	0
the	0
first	1
year	1
that	0
she	0
has	0
gotten	0
weak	1
and	0
actually	1
has	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
little	0
walker	1
but	0
with	0
somebody	1
that	0
needs	0
around	1
the	0
clock	0
care	1
i	1
have	0
seen	1
my	0
family	1
age	1

right	1

i've	0
seen	1
them	0
in	1
the	0
she's	0
been	0
there	0
ten	0
years	1
now	0
and	0
i	0
have	0
seen	0
them	0
age	1
twenty	1
in	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
and	0
with	0
the	0
expense	1
and	0
everything	1

yeah	1

i	0
th[ink]	0
i	0
still	1
think	0
it	0
is	0
worth	1
it	0
if	0
you	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
a	0
good	1
nursing	1
home	1
and	1
they	0
needed	1
some	0
quality	1
care	1
i	1
would	1
put	1
someone	1
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0

right	1

my	0
mother-in-law	1
finally	1
they	0
had	1
to	0
make	0
a	0
family	1
decision	1
there's	0
seven	1
children	1
in	0
my	0
husband's	0
family	1
and	0
fortunately	1
four	1
of	0
them_1	0
live	0
in	0
the	0
same	1
home	0
town	1
and	1
she	0
has	0
alzheimer's	1
it	0
was	0
getting	1
where	0
she	1
was	0
getting	1
th[ings]	0
dangerous	1
i	0
mean	1
letting	0
strangers	1
in	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
this	1
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0
they	1
were	0
very	0
fortunate	1
it's	0
a	0
small	1
town	1
and	0
she	0
happens	1
to	0
room	1
with	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
doctor's	1
mother's	1
and	0
then	1
she's	0
got	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
family	1
there	1
and	0
that	1
go	1
and	0
see	1
her	0
all	0
of	0
the	1
time	1
but	0

oh	0
well	0
that's	1
good	1

but	0
she	1
really	1
doesn't	0
nobody	1
thought	0
she	1
would	1
adjust	1
but	1
she's	0
adjusted	1
beautifully	1

oh	0
that	1
is	0
great	1

but	0
then	1
i	1
am	1
also	1
facing	1
my	1
father	1
who	1
is	0
very	1
sick	1
and	1
my	0
mother	1
and	1
father	1
reside	0
in	1
colorado	1
she's	1
been	1
taking	0
care	1
of	1
him	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	0
much	0
longer	1
this	0
can	0
last	1
and	1
at	0
that	1
point	1
because_1	0
he	1
requires	0
round	1
the	0
clock	0
he	0
can't	1
do	0
anything	0
without	1
her	0
he	0
doesn't	0
know	1
when	1
to	0
take	0
his	0
medicine	1
and	0
it's	0
really	1
sad	1
and	0
i	1
have	1
thought	1
if	0
something	1
would	0
happen	0
to	0
my	0
mother	1
for	1
uh	0
my	0
brother's	1
are	0
not	1
interested	0
in	0
helping	1
me	0
so	1
i	1
would	1
have	0
to	1
move	1
him	1
down	1
here	1
that	1
way	0
i	1
want	0
to	0
see	1
the	0
nursing	0
home	0
if	0
i	0
have	1
to	0
put	0
him	0
into	1
one	0
you	1
know	0
where	0
i	1
can	0
go	0
see	1
it	0
i	0
i'd	0
be	0
very	1
uncomfortable	1
with	0
him	0
being	1
in	0
colorado	1
and	0

why	0
yeah	1
i'm	0
sure	1
you	1
have	1
got	0
some	0
really	1
good	1
nursing	1
homes	0
around	0
dallas	1

yes	1
and	0
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
limited	1
care	1
too	0
where	0
people	1
can	0
do	1
uh	1
like	1
they	0
have	0
apartment	1
styles	1
but	0
that	1
wouldn't	0
work	1
for	0
him	1
i	0
think	1
he's	0
beyond	1
that	0
where	1
if	0
you	0
need	1
help	1
you	0
can	0
get	1
it	0
but	0
basically	1
people	1
kind	0
of	0
have	0
a	0
small	0
apartment	1
and	0
doctor's	1
are	0
available	1
if	0
they	0
need	1
them	0

um-hum	0
i	0
i	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lady	1
that	0
lives	1
in	0
a	0
place	1
similar	1
to	0
that	1
in	0
austin	1

and	0
allows	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
well	0
the	0
only	0
problem	1
with	0
these	0
are	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
very	1
expensive	1
of	0
course	0
i	0
guess	0
all	1
nursing	0
homes	1
there	0
is	1
but	1

and	0
the	0
bad	1
thing	0
about	1
it	0
before	1
you	0
can	0
get	0
any	1
kind	0
of	0
government	1
help	1
you	0
just	0
practically	1
have	0
we	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
pauper	1

right	1

it	0
it	1
takes	0
every	1
penny	1
they	0
want	1
you	0
to	0
spend	1
every	0
dime	1
you	0
have	1
before	1
the	0
government	1
will	0
pay	1
for	0
your	0
your	0
care	1

yeah	1

right	1

and	0
that's	1
the	0
sad	1
part	0
about	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	1
s[ee]	0
uh	0
yeah	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
who	0
do	0
it	0
now	1
in	0
colorado	1
it's	0
interesting	1
i	0
talked	1
to	0
my	0
mother	1
they	0
allow	1
you	0
sixty	1
five	0
thousand	1
dollars	1
and	0
your	0
car	1
and	0
your	0
home	1
and	0
my	1
mother	1
could	0
make	1
it	0
on	0
that	1
what	0
she	0
probably	1
would	0
do	1
is	0
disburse	1
the	0
money	1
to	0
me	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
would	0
send	0
it	0
back	1
to	0
her	0
so	0
that's	0
[laughter-probably]	1
what	0
would	1
happen	0

um-hum	0
i	1
think	0
that's	0
what	0
most	0
people	0
do	1
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
give	1
it	0
everything	0
away	1

yeah	1
it's	0
unfortunate	1

i	0
i	0
i	1
work	0
at	0
a	0
brokerage	1
firm	1
and	0
i	1
have	0
seen	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
that	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
gift	1
you	0
know	1
their	0
belongings	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
they	0
can	1
each	0
year	1
in	0
anticipation	1
of	0
having	0
to	0
move	0
to	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0

right	1

yeah	1
it's	0
frightening	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	0
old	1
you	0
are	0
i'm	0
forty	0
six	1
you	0
know	1
we're	1
the	0
generation	1
moving	0
into	1
this	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
our	0
kids	1
are	0
gonna	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
us	0
you	0
know	1

i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
i'm	1

i'm	1
twenty	0
nine	1

yeah	1

and	1
everybody	1
in	0
my	0
family's	1
always	1
had	0
we	0
don't	0
have	1
any	0
children	1
everybody	0
that	0
has	1
has	0
them_1	0
later	1
in	0
life	1
so	1

yeah	1

so	1
my	0
my	0

far	1
away	1

right	1

i	0
also	1
fill	0
in	0
my	1
generation	1
a	0
squeeze	1
between	0
looking	1
to	0
having	1
to	0
help	1
my	0
parents	1
and	0
still	1
having	0
to	0
help	0
my	0
son	1
because	0
things	0
are	0
so	0
rough	1
out	0
there	0
job	1
wise	0
and	0
he's	0
still	1
living	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	0
he's	0
ever	0
going	0
to	0
[laughter-get]	1
on	0
his	0
own	1
the	0
way	0
things	0
are	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1

and	0
so	0
it's	1
kind	1
of	0
sq[ueezed]	0
you	0
feel	0
squeezed	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
having	0
both	1
generations	1
but	0
it	0
something	1
will	0
have	0
to	0
change	1
as	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	0
us	0
get	0
older	1
uh	0
luckily	1
if	0
we	0
could	0
be	0
like	1
your	0
grandmother	1
i	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
would	0
love	1
to	0
live	0

a	0
hundred	0
and	0
two	1
if	0
i	0
were	0
okay	1
but	0

these	0
people	1
in	0
their	0
seventies	1
yeah	1

it	0
but	0
yeah	1
most	0

most	0
people	0
aren't	1

yeah	1
most	1
aren't	1
that's	0
the	0
problem	1

and	0
that's	0
the	0
bad	0
thing	1
i	0
would	0
hate	1
to	0
have	0
lived	1
so	0
long	1
she	1
lived	0
by	0
herself	1
my	0
grandfather	1
passed	0
away	0
before	0
i	1
was	0
born	0
so	0
she	1
lived	0
by	0
herself	1
up	0
until	0
she	0
was	0
ninety	1
ninety	0
one	1
and	0
just	0
did	0
everything	1
and	0

that's	1
incredible	1

okay	1

okay	1

first	1

well	1
i	1
have	1
um	0
two	1
kids	1
i	1
have	1
one	0
seven	1
and	0
one	0
five	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
they're	1
in	1
a	1
public	0
school	1
here	0
in	0
tyler	1
and	0
um	0
i'm	1
happy	1
with	1
it	1

um-hum	0

i'm	1
happy	1
with	0
their	1
school	1
it's	1
great	1
good	0
teachers	1
good	0
curriculum	1
um	1
they	0
learn	1
a	1
lot	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
problems	1
um	0
but	1
i	1
do	1
live	1
in	1
the	0
better	1
and	0
well	1
in	1
the	0
best	1
part	0
of	0
the	1
city	1
though	1
i	1
live	1
in	1
you	1
know	0
the	1
real	1
richy	1
part	1
i	1
guess	1
i'm	1
not	1
but	1

but	1
everybody	0
around	1
me	1
is	1
and	1
um	1
but	1
the	1
i	0
have	1
friends	1
that	1
live	1
in	1
the	0
other	1
the	1
less	1
fortunate	1
or	0
whatever	0
you	0
wanna	0
call	1
it	0
part	0
of	1
town	1
and	1
their	1
schools	1
are	0
kind	0
of	0
rundown	1
and	0
um	0
older	1
and	0
they	1
don't	1
really	1
offer	1
as	0
much	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
as	0
uh	0
the	0
school	0
that	0
my	1
girls	0
are	0
in	1
i	0
don't	1
really	0
think	0
that's	1
fair	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	1

um	0
but	1
you	0
know	1
i'm	0
happy	1
with	0
what	1
they're	0
in	1
so	0
go	0
ahead	1

well	1
yeah	1
it	0
it's	0
it's	0
pretty	1
much	0
what	0
i	1
was	0
going	0
to	0
say	0
is	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	1
disparity	1
between	0
different	1
neighborhoods	1
and	1
what	0
sort	1
of	1
schools	1
go	0
in	1

um-hum	0

um	0
i	1
grew	0
up	0
in	0
new	0
york	1
and	1
um	1
the	0
place	1
or	0

wow	1

or	0
not	1
new	1
york	1
city	1
upstate	1
new	0
york	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	1
went	0
to	0
uh	0
the	0
city	1
of	0
rochester	1
school	1
district	1

um-hum	0

and	1
s[o]	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
my	1
friends	1
were	0
in	0
one	1
of	0
the	1
neighboring	1
suburbs	1
and	0
it	0
wasn't	1
we	0
weren't	1
too	1
far	0
removed	1
geographically	1
from	0
each	0
other	1
but	1
the	0
difference	1
in	0
schools	1
i	0
think	0
was	0
pretty	0
substantial	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
that	0
probably	1
would	0
have	0
been	0
better	1
if	0
is	0
if	0
the	0
entire	1
county	1
had	0
had	1
had	1
just	1
one	1
school	1
system	0

right	1

and	0
that	1
would	0
result	1
in	0
some	0
um	0
could	1
result	0
in	0
more	0
equitable	1
distribution	0
of	1
money	1
because	0
what	0
was	0
happening	1
was	0
you	1
know	1
all	0
the	0
very	0
rich	1
people	0
went	0
out	1
to	0
the	1
move	1
out	0
to	1
the	1
suburbs	1
and	0
the	0
city	1
had	1
a	0
very	1
low	0
tax	1
base	0
so	1
they	0
didn't	1
have	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
money	1
to	1
work	1
with	0

uh-huh	0

as	1
a	0
result	0
the	0
schools	1
were	0
rundown	1
there	0
wasn't	1
as	0
many	0
you	1
know	0
the	1
nice	1
supplies	1
in	1
science	1
class	1
that	0
we	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
there	0
wasn't	1
as	0
many	1
advanced	0
placement	1
courses	1
uh	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
a	1
senior	1
as	0
some	1
other	0
schools	0
had	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
it	0
it	0
so	1
i	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
ways	1
to	0
to	0
to	0
help	1
schools	0
in	0
general	1
uh	0
and	0
get	1
them	0
all	1
to	0
a	0
minimum	0
level	1
of	0
of	0
of	0
competency	1
almost	1
would	0
be	1
to	0
expand	1
the	0
size	1
of	0
school	1
districts	1
so	0
you	1
get	1
a	0
wider	1
variety	1
of	0
people	1
and	0
the	0
the	0
problem	1
with	0
that	0
is	0
then	0
then	1
then	0
people	1
will	0
either	1
the	0
rich	1
people	0
will	0
either	0
pull	1
their	0
kids	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
public	1
school	0
and	0
put	0
them	0
in	0
private	1
schools	0
or	1
they'll	0
move	1
farther	1
away	1
to	1
get	0
better	0
schools	1
so	1

yeah	1

[laughter-right]	1

so	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
you	1
end	0
up	0
chasing	1
like	0
a	0
dog	1
chasing	0
its	0
own	0
tail	1
sort	0
of	0

also	1
um	0
the	0
the	0
family	1
environment	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
can	0
come	1
to	0
south	0
tyler	1
where	0
i	0
live	1
and	0
you	1
have	0
got	0
room	1
mothers	0
in	0
every	0
room	1

got	0
every	1
every	1

the	0
kids	1

these	0
really	0
supportive	1
really	1
supportive	0
parents	1
always	1
up	0
there	0
for	0
something	1

yeah	0

you	1
can	0
go	1
to	0
north	0
tyler	1
to	0
the	0
schools	1
and	0
the	0
parents	1
might	1
not	0

even	0
tell	1
you	0
what	1
their	0
kid's	0
teacher's	1
name	0
is	0
you	1
know	0
um	0

um-hum	0

um	0
that	1
has	1
a	1
a	0
whole	1
lot	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
it	0
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
their	0
learning	1
i	0
mean	0
if	0
the	0
parents	1
aren't	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
willing	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
the	0
kids	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
they're	1
learning	1
and	0
if	1
they're	0
learning	1
you	1
know	1
they	0
really	1
don't	0
have	1
much	0
of	1
a	1
chance	1
at	0
all	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

why	1
is	1
that	1

huh	1

why	0
is	1
that	0

why	0
are	0
[laughter-you]	0
you	1

you	1
j[ust]	0
they	1
just	1
don't	1
i	1
mean	0
i	1
mean	0
i'm	1
i'm	1
up	0
there	0
at	0
my	1
kid's	1
school	1
i	0
know	1
what	1
they're	0
learning	1
and	0
if	1
they're	0
up	1
i	0
call	1
and	0
find	1
out	1
you	1
know	1
is	1
she	0
having	0
problems	1
does	1
she	1
need	0
help	1
with	1
anything	0
no	1
she's	1
doing	0
fine	1
okay	1
you	0
know	1
um	0
and	0
i	0
i	1
know	1
kids	1
that	0
their	0
parents	1
could	0
really	0
give	0
a	0
rip	1
and	0
the	0
kids	1
are	0
not	0
motivated	0

right	0

right	0

they	0
have	0
no	1
motivation	0
from	0
home	1
so	0
they	1
just	0
go	0
to	0
school	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
eh	0
you	0
know	1
i'll	0
get	0
through	0
the	0
day	1
and	0
um	0
bring	0
homework	1
home	1
and	0
there's	1
nobody	0
to	0
to	0
sit	0
them	0
down	1
and	0
say	0
you're	1
going	0
to	0
do	1
this	0

right	0

um	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
they	0
they	0
take	1
a	0
notion	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
they	0
do	1
and	0
um	0
that	1
doesn't	0
work	0
either	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
guidance	1
and	0
um	0
they	0
can't	1
just	0
have	1
it	0
at	0
school	1
and	0
then	0
come	0
home	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
there's	0
nothing	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
i	0
know	1
that	0
that	1
that	0
was	1
a	0
big	0
factor	1
for	0
me	1
i	0
ended	1
up	0
coming	0
out	1
of	0
of	0
the	0
public	0
school	1
system	0
very	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
with	0
very	1
good	0
education	1
i	0
ended	1

uh-huh	0

ended	1
up	0
getting	1
some	0
scholarships	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
college	1
and	0
which	0
has	0
been	1
you	1
know	0
which	0
is	0
really	1
nice	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
difference	1
for	0
me	1
was	1
that	0
my	0
parents	1
were	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
were	0
definitely	1
they	0
were	0
always	1
there	0
was	0

yeah	1

was	0
like	0
well	0
yeah	1
of	0
course	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
study	1
and	0
do	0
well	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	0
the	0
way	1
of	0
course	1
are	0
you	0
know	0

so	1
how	1
do	1
you	0
get	1
most	1
of	0
your	1
current	1
event	0
information	1

well	1
duri[ng]	1
see	1
i'm	1
going	1
to	1
school	1
right	1
now	1
and	1
uh	1
while	1
i'm	1
working	1
i	1
don't	1
get	1
a	1
i	1
don't	1
get	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
paper	1
a	1
lot	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
i	0
don't	1
watch	0
tv	1
as	1
much	1
really	1
either	1
because	0
uh	1
my	1
free	1
time	1
is	1
kind	1
of	1
and	0
i	0
do	1
like	1
to	0
do	1
other	1
stuff	1
with	0
it	1

right	1

while	1
i'm	0
at	0
work	1
sometimes	0
i	0
on	0
the	0
computer	1
network	0
um	0
i	0
read	1
the	1
news	1
sometimes	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
that's	1
kind	0
of	1
helpful	1

i	0
would	0
imagine	1
going	0
to	0
college	1
though	0
your	0
professors	1
and	1
different	0
things	1
you	0
keep	1
up	1
on	0
what's	0
going	1
on	1

that's	0
true	1
i	0
mean	0
my	1
roommates	0
and	1
stuff	1
you	0
know	1
people	0
around	1
me	0
talk	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	1

and	0
the	0
people	1
i	0
work	0
with	0
are	0
pretty	0
you	1
know	0
up	0
up-to-date	1
on	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
stuff	0
so	0

right	1
well	1
i'm	1
a	0
housewife	1
i	0
have	0
three	1
kids	1
and	1
so	0
um	0
i	1
get	1
most	0
of	0
my	0
information	1
probably	1
through	0
just	1
the	0
news	1
at	0
six	1
o'clock	0
and	0
then	1
um	0
talking	1
with	0
people	0
and	1
just	0
hearing	1
what's	0
going	1
on	1
but	0

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	0
watch	1
do	0
you	0
watch	0
the	0
network	1
like	0
major	1
network	0
news	1
or	0
do	0
you	0
watch	0
like	0
the	0
mcneil	1
lehrer	1
hour	0

just	1
the	1
regular	0
channel	1
just	1
channel	0
eight	1

oh	1
really	1

that's	1
our	0
channel	0
here	1
that's	0
the	0
um	0
eyewitness	1
news	0

uh-huh	0

so	1

oh	1
ch[annel]	0
see	0
channel	1
where	0
i	1
am	1
channel	0
eight's	1
um	0
like	0
public	1
tv	1
so	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
different	1

oh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1

i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
the	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	1
commentators	1
on	0
like	1
the	0
major	1
networks	1
like	1
right	1
it's	1
kind	1
of	0
appropriate	1
right	0
now	1
because	1
of	1
the	0
election	1
stuff	1
going	0
on	0
but	1
um	0
it	1
seems	1
that	1
um	0
they	1
kind	1
of	0
get	1
to	1
throw	1
their	1
opinions	1
into	1
how	1
they	1
you	1
know	1
report	1
on	0
the	1
news	1

right	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
even	1
in	0
the	0
elections	1
they	0
choose	1
who	0
they're	0
going	0
to	1
follow	1
and	0
who	0
they're	0
not	1
and	0
basically	1
you	0
know	1
if	1
a	0
c[andidate]	0
candidate	1
can	0
get	1
them	1
to	0
follow	1
then	1
the	0
news	1
will	1
you	1
know	1
kind	1
of	0
publicize	1
his	0
name	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
exactly	1

i	1
don't	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
way	0
i	1
get	1
the	1
news	1
is	1
the	1
right	1
way	0
to	1
get	1
it	1
i	1
think	1
you	1
get	1
a	0
very	1
lopsided	1
picture	1
of	0
what's	0
going	1
on	1

uh-huh	0
uh	0
because	0
they	1
can	0
they	0
can	0
only	1
report	1
on	0
i	0
mean	1
they	0
give	1
each	0
candidate	1
perhaps	1
you	0
know	1
ten	1
second	0
blurbs	1
in	0
which	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
say	1
you	0
you	0
just	1
can't	0
get	0
a	0
full	0
picture	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
their	0
message	1
unless	1
you	0
have	0
time	1
to	0
sit	0
down	0
and	0
r[ead]	0
and	0
probably	0
read	1
something	0
on	0
it	0

right	1

right	1
and	0
the	0
news	1
too	0
it	0
just	1
doesn't	0
um	0
cover	1
a[ll]	0
that	1
many	0
stories	1
i	0

every	1

a	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
um	0
now	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	0
have	0
friends	1
that	1
clip	1
articles	1
or	0
if	0
i	1
you	1

in	0
something	0
of	0
course	1
during	0
the	0
w[ar]	0
when	0
we	1
were	0
in	0
war	1
i	0
read	1
up	0
on	0
that	1
just	0
a	0
little	0
in	0
the	0
newspaper	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
what	0
was	1
going	0
on	1
but	0

oh	0
yeah	1

but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	1
times	0
i	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
wish	1
i	0
had	1
the	0
time	1
to	0
read	1
all	0
the	0

in	0
the	0

but	0
i	0
just	1
can't	0
seem	0
to	0
find	0
the	0
time	1

yeah	1

if	0
they'd	0
put	1
it	0
out	0
in	0
a	1
video	1
or	1
on	0
not	0
a	1
video	1
but	0
a	0
cassette	1
tape	1
or	0
something	1
where	0
you	1
could	0
just	0
listen	1
to	0
it	1
i	1
would	0
do	0
that	1
while	1
i	1
was	0
doing	0
other	1
things	1

yeah	1

but	0

well	0
i	1
remember	0
dur[ing]	0
back	1
during	0
the	0
uh	0
during	0
the	0
war	1
everyone	0
here	0
at	0
work	1
always	0
had	0
the	0
radio	1
or	0
the	0
tv	1
on	0
because_1	0
that	1
they	1
were	0
going	0
constantly	1
with	0
that	1
stuff	0

right	1

but	0
uh	0

well	1
i	0
um	0
they	1
even	0
did	0
a	0
story	1
on	0
our	0
news	0
here	1
in	0
texas	1
on	0
what	1
people	0
wanted	0
to	0
see	0
more	1
of	0
and	0
people	1
said	0
that	0
they	0
wanted	0
to	0
see	0
more	1
on	1
outside	1
of	0
texas	1
news	1
you	0
know	1
we	1
just	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
hear	1
every	0
night	0
all	0
the	0
killings	1
that	0
went	0
on	1
here	0
in	0
dallas	1

yeah	1

that	1
we	0
want	0
to	0
hear	0
what's	1
going	0
on	1
with	0
the	0
economy	1
what's	1
being	0
done	0
to	0
help	1
it	0
what's	1
going	0
on	1
in	0
other	0
countries	1
what's	0
you	0
know	1
just	0
more	1
information	1

if	0
they	0
reported	1
every	0
m[urder]	0
if	0
they	0
reported	1
every	0
violent	1
crime	0
in	0
atlanta	1
it	0
would	0
take	0
it	0
would	0
probably	1
take	0
the	0
whole	1
news	1
[laughter-hour]	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
well	0

but	0
uh	1

well	0
i	0
guess	1
you'll	0
get	0
pretty	0
good	0
news	1
coverage	0
in	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	1
when	0
you	0
host	1
the	0
uh	0
summer	0
olympics	1

oh	0
yeah	1
that's	1
they	0
still	1
already	1
they're	0
having	0
like	0
um	0
in	0
the	0
newspaper	1
they	0
have	0
a	0
section	1
i	0
think	1
every	0
now	1
and	0
then	0
o[n]	0
on	0
the	0
olympics	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
they've	1
got	0
like	1
a	0
countdown	1
it's	1
like	0
sixteen	1
hundred	0
days	1
or	1
something	1

i	1
know	0
we're	1
trying	0
to	1
get	1
tickets	1
to	0
it	1
right	0
now	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

that's	1
gonna	0
be	0
crazy	1
that	0
time	0
of	0
year	1
here	0
but	0

but	0
uh	0

yeah	1

i	0
can't	1
believe	1
i	0
mean	0
they're	0
they're	1
uh	0
stretching	1
out	1
the	0
olympic	1
news	0
for	0
that	0
much	0
coverage	1
over	0
i	0
guess	1
people	0
want	0
to	0
hear	1
about	0
it	0
also	1
big	0
in	0
big	1
in	0
the	0
news	1
right	0
now	0
is	0
the	0
braves	1
because	0
they're	1
uh	0
they're	0
in	0
you	1
know	0
tr[aining]	0
spring	0
training	1
or	0
whatever	0
and	0

right	1
right	1

and	0
they	0
did	1
so	0
well	0
last	1
year	0

yeah	1
they	1
spent	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
time	0
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
they	0
spend	0
a	0
long	1
time	0
on	0
sports	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
um	0
that's	1
fine	1
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	0
more	1
time	0
spent	0
on	0
other	1
things	1

yeah	1

but	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
they	0
way	1
they	0
do	0
the	0
newscasts	1
uh	0
i	0
wish	1
they	0
they	0
kind	0
of	0
separated	1
it	0
you	1
know	0
or	0
if	0
you	0
wanted	1
to	0
watch	0
one	1
thing	0
you	0
could	0
turn	1
to	0
s[ome]	0
some	0
channel	1
for	0
it	0
but	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
cable	1

i	1
pay	1
a	1
good	1
deal	0
of	1
taxes	1
i	1
guess	1
because	1
i	1
i	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
amount	1
of	0
money	1
and	1
uh	1
the	1
taxes	0
that	1
i	1
pay	1
um	1
i	1
guess	0
as	1
a	1
as	0
a	1
general	1
statement	1
i	1
feel	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
get	0
my	0
money's	1
worth	0
for	1

okay	1

i'm	1
not	1
sure	1
though	1
whether	1
i	0
feel	1
i	0
guess	0
i	0
am	1
sure	0
that	0
i	0
feel	1
that	1
in	0
general	1
though	0
uh	1
the	1
allocation	0
uh	0
of	0
the	1
taxes	0
in	0
certain	1
areas	1
i[sn't]	1
isn't	0
correct	1

well	0
i'm	1
sure	1
that	0
uh	0
probably	1
every	0
person	0
in	0
this	1
country	1
would	0
agree	1
with	1
you	1
on	0
that	1
because_1	1
everybody	1
has	0
a	0
different	0
idea	1
of	0
where	0
the	0
money	0
should	0
go	1

well	0
i	1
i	0
lately	1
i	0
guess	0
um	1
uh	0
or	0
at	0
least	0
for	1
the	1
last	0
t[wenty]	0
twenty	0
years	0
or	1
so	0
i've	0
felt	0
that	1
the	0
expenditures	0
of	1
our	0
taxes	0
into	0
high	0
cost	0
uh	0
defense	0
items	0
at	1
least	0
in	0
the	0
last	1
ten	0
years	0
have	0
been	1
uh	0
there's	1
been	0
and	0
extraordinary	1
amount	1
of	0
money	0
spent	1
there	1
and	0
i'm	0
not	1
really	0
sure	1
that	0
that	1
we've	0
gotten	0
our	0
money's	1
worth	0
there	1
uh	0
regardless	1
of	0
the	1
outcome	1
of	0
the	0
desert	0
storm	1
uh	1
desert	0
shield	1
uh	0
situations	1

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

uh	0
i	0
guess	0
my	1
particular	0
beef	1
is	0
that	0
having	0
participated	1
in	0
the	0
mi[litary]	1
military	1
off	0
and	0
on	1
over	0
the	1
over	0
the	0
years	1
of	0
being	0
called	0
back	1
and	0
things	0
of	0
that	0
nature	1
is	0
uh	0
i've	0
found	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
there's	1
an	0
extraordinary	1
amount	0
of	0
waste	1
i	0
take	1
that	1
as	0
a	1
as	0
a	0
given	1
in	0
any	0
military	0
operation	1
and	0

oh	0
yeah	1
no	0
argument	0
here	1

yeah	0
and	0
i	0
gue[ss]	0
i	0
i	0
should	0
imagine	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
what	0
the	0
what	0
the	0
problem	0
why	0
i	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
a	0
little	1
concerned	1
about	0
today	1
is	0
that	1
this	0
uh	0
rather	0
uh	1
quick	0
and	0
and	0
easy	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0
shouldn't	0
say	0
easy	0
rather	0
quick	0
victory	0
in	0
the	0
in	0
in	0
the	0
uh	0
mideast	0
uh	0
uh	0
over	0
the	0
uh	0
iraqis	0
uh	1
might	0
lead	0
us	0
into	0
uh	0
a	0
false	0
sense	0
of	0
security	0
that	0
we	0
can	0
do	0
that	0
against	0
any	0
other	0
foe	0
i'm	1
i	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
what	1
other	0
foe	1
that	0
would	0
be	1
but	1
uh	1
i	1
i'm	0
just	0
getting	0
nervous	1
again	1
now	0
hearing	0
the	0
voices	1
come	1
up	0
that	1
there	0
has	1
to	0
be	1
increased	0
expenditures	1
in	0
that	0
area	1

yeah	1
well	1
of	1
course	1
uh	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
uh	0
a	0
lot	1
of	1
missiles	1
and	0
things	0
were	0
expended	1
in	0
the	0
course	1
of	0
fighting	0
the	0
war	1
and	0
the	1
and	0
the	0
inventory's	1
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	1
be	1
restocked	1
uh	0
on	1
now	0
i	1
work	1
for	0
ti	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	0
things	1
we	1
were	1
told	1
is	1
like	0
they	1
had	1
eleven	1
thousand	0
harm	1
missiles	1
which	0
ti	1
is	1
the	0
sole	0
supplier	1
for	0
and	1
they	0
used	0
up	1
two	0
thousand	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
in	1
the	1
war	1
so	0
they're	1
going	1
to	1
have	0
to	1
do	0
another	1
contract	1
to	1
restock	1
that	1
to	0
get	0
ready	1
in	0
case	0
something	1
else	1
is	0
needed	1

yeah	0
but	0
it	0
it	0
it	0
it	0
would	0
that	0
be	0
uh	0
well	0
let's	0
see	0
two	0
thousand	1
out	0
of	0
eleven	0
thousand	1
that's	0
about	1
a	0
little	0
over	1
twenty	1
per	0
cent	1
uh	0
i	1
i	1
should	0
imagine	1
that	1
that	0
would	1
be	0
to	0
keep	1
it	0
at	0
a	0
level	1
those	0
levels	1
i	0
guess	1
that	1
that	0
were	0
originally	1
appropriated	1
w[as]	0
was	0
when	1
the	0
soviet	1
threat	0
i	0
guess	1
was	0
perceived	1
as	0
being	1
a	0
greater	1
one	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
there's	0
very	0
much	0
of	0
a	0
threat	1
there	0
today	1
i	0
do	0
worry	1
about	0
what	1
nuclear	1
weapons	0
are	0
left	1
in	0
the	0
territories	1
uh	0
in	0
their	0
territory	1
over	0
there	1
and	0
who's	1
controlling	1
them	0
but	0

that	1
that's	0
true	0
that's	0
true	1

i	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
what	0
amount	1
of	0
what	0
amount	1
of	0
our	0
hardware	1
would	0
stop	1
some	0
fanatic	1
i	0
guess	0
from	0
doing	1
anything	1
uh	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
irrational	1

well	0
of	0
of	0
course	0
now	0
we	0
used	1
up	0
twenty	1
per	0
cents	1
per	0
cent	1
of	0
that	0
inventory	1
in	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0
just	0
a	0
few	0
weeks	1

right	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
uh	0
uh	0
ti	1
also	0
makes	0
the	0
missile	0
which	0
was	0
the	1
the	0
tv	1
laser	1
guided	0
bombs	1

yeah	0

and	1
and	0
a	0
big	0
percentage	1
of	0
that	1
was	1
expended	1
as	0
well	1
that	0
that	1
w[as]	0
that	0
was	0
just	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0

w[hat]	0
what	1
is	0
the	0
name	0
of	0
that	1

uh	0
it's	0
called	0
paveway	0

yes	0
yes	0

and	0
uh	0
a	0
big	0
percentage	1
of	0
that	0
was	0
used	0
up	1
during	1
that	0
conflict	1
also	1
so	0
tho[se]	1
those	1
are	0
two	1
areas	1
in	0
which	0
ti	1
stands	1
to	0
to	0
gain	1
some	0
some	0
short	1
term	0
business	0
to	0
restock	1
that	0

yeah	1
well	0
i	0
i	0
i'm	1
what	0
i'm	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	0
uh	0
it	0
concerned	0
about	0
talking	0
about	0
the	0
taxes	1
in	0
general	1
and	0
that	1
that	0
was	1
an	0
area	1
that	0
i	1
i	0
perceive	1
as	0
not	1
being	1
the	0
best	1
expenditure	1
for	0
the	0
amount	1
of	0
dollar	1
that	0
we're	0
taxed	1
for	0
uh	0
in	0
the	0
area	0
of	0
defense	0
or	0
perhaps	1
we	0
have	1
paid	0
too	0
much	0
there	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it	0
just	1
seems	0
to	0
me	1
that	0
over	0
the	0
years	1
now	1
the	1
and	1
and	0
it's	1
it's	0
a	0
cliche	1
i	0
i	0
but	0
i	0
see	1
it	0
myself	1
i	0
see	1
where	0
the	0
infrastructure	1
is	1
sort	0
of	0
breaking	0
down	0
the	0
roads	1
the	0
highways	1

oh	0
no	0
doubt	0

i	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
i	0
kn[ow]	0
i'm	0
familiar	0
with	0
some	0
some	0
upbeat	0
school	0
areas	0
so	0
i	0
don't	1
totally	1
agree	0
with	0
the	1
the	0
great	1
uh	0
uh	1
with	1
the	0
with	0
the	1
great	1
ex[penditure]	1
expenditure	1
of	0
effort	1
and	1
time	1
there	0
but	0
i	0
guess	0
overall	1
because	0
i	0
guess	0
i'm	0
not	0
associated	1
with	0
what	1
ghetto	1
schools	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
and	0
uh	0
rural	1
school	0
systems	0
are	0
like	1
i	1
i	0
should	0
imagine	0
that	1
would	0
take	0
an	0
enormous	0
expenditure	1

yeah	0
as	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0
fact	0
in	0
texas	1
um	0
we've	1
had	1
our	0
school	1
funding	1
system	0
declared	0
unconstitutional	1
by	0
the	1
a	0
state	1
judge	1
and	0
they	1
and	0
uh	0
the	1
legislature	1
just	0
passed	1
what	0
they	0
called	0
a	0
robin	1
hood	0
bill	1
which	1
basically	0
what	1
it	1
does	0
is	0
it	0
takes	1
extra	1
money	0
from	1
the	1
more	0
affluent	1
school	1
districts	1
that	0
are	1
that	0
are	0
you	1
know	1
come	0
from	1
local	1
taxes	1
and	0
send	1
them	0
to	0
other	1
parts	0
of	1
the	0
state	1
that	0
are	0
not	1
so	0
affluent	1

um-hum	0

that	1
they	0
don't	0
have	1
a	0
broad	0
based	0
income	0
tax	1
that	0
funds	1
the	0
educational	0
system	1
or	0

uh	0
well	0

or	0
is	0
it	0
all	0
funded	1
out	0
of	0
local	1
taxes	1

okay	0
to	0
g[ive]	1
to	0
give	1
you	0
some	0
perspective	1
this	1
this	0
town	1
that	0
i	1
had	0
lived	1
in	0
for	1
sometime	1
in	0
nineteen	1
eighty	0
three	0
was	0
funded	1
sixty	0
five	0
per	0
cent	0
by	0
state	0
funds	1

yeah	0

then	0
we	0
had	1
a	0
number	0
of	0
education	1
reforms	1
that	1
the	1
legislature	1
said	1
hey	1
we	1
got	0
to	0
do	1
this	1
we	1
got	0
to	1
do	0
this	1
we	1
got	0
to	0
do	0
this	1
but	1
they	0
forgot	1
to	1
put	1
in	0
the	0
state	1
budget	1
the	0
money	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
it	0
and	1
they	0
dumped	1
it	0
all	1
on	0
the	0
local	1
school	1
districts	1
so	0

sounds	1
like	0
the	0
way	0
the	0
federal	1
and	0
state	0
system	0
works	0
[laughter-now]	1

really	0
so	0

yeah	0

so	0
so	0
what	0
ended	0
up	0
happening	0
was	0
was	0
a	0
was	0
a	0
shift	0
we	0
went	0
to	0
sixty	1
five	0
per	0
cent	0
state	1
funding	0
to	0
sixty	0
five	0
per	0
cent	1
local	1
funding	1
in	0
a	0
matter	0
of	0
four	1
years	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
mean	0

uh	0
do	0
you	0
mean	1
a	0
a	0
complete	0
reversal	1
because	0
i	0
guess	0
they	0
can't	1
raise	0
that	0
money	1
in	0
those	1
those	0
poorer	0
districts	1
huh	0

oh	0
complete	0
complete	0
it's	0
all	1
shifted	0
to	0
local	1
districts	1
and	0
now	1
even	0
the	0
money	0
that's	0
been	0
raised	1
for	0
the	0
local	1
districts	0
is	0
being	1
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
siphoned	1
off	0
and	0
sent	1
to	0
other	0
parts	0
of	0
the	0
state	1

that's	0
right	1
and	1
and	0
i	1
have	1
i	0
have	1
no	1
problem	1
with	1
uh	0
a	0
certain	1
uh	0
floor	0
level	1
minimum	1
level	1
that's	0
a	0
standard	1
uh	0
that	0
everybody	1
uh	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
have	1
uh	0

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
am	1
opposed	0
to	1
any	1
attempts	0
to	0
restrict	1
um	0
local	1
communities	0
from	0
taxing	1
themselves	0
above	1
that	0
to	0
provide	1
above	1
the	0
minimum	1

yes	0
i	0
see	1
what	0
you're	0
saying	1
uh	0
i	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
do	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
am	0
a	0
s[trong]	1
uh	0
a	0
strong	1
and	0
staunch	0
supporter	1
of	0
some	1
subsidy	1
for	0
any	1
forms	0
of	0
education	1
i	0
mean	1
by	0
that	1
i	0
mean	1
i'm	0
a	0
product	1
myself	1
i	0
have	1
uh	0
a	0
a	0
a	1
a	0
background	1
of	0
uh	0
being	1
uh	0
getting	0
my	0
college	1
education	1
through	0
the	0
gi	0
bill	1

so	0
did	0
i	0
my	0
master's	0
anyway	0

what	0
but	0
uh	1
when	0
i	0
look	1
at	0
it	0
to	0
me	1
uh	0
it	0
doesn't	1
really	0
make	0
any	0
difference	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
marvelous	1
opportunity	0
that	0
i	1
couldn't	1
have	0
done	1
i	0
don't	1
think	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
gone	0
on	1
unless	0
i	0
had	1
that	1
financial	1
uh	0
easement	1
made	0
possible	1

yeah	0

that's	0
right	0

and	0
i	1
i	0
don't	0
really	0
care	1
what	0
it	0
takes	1
to	0
qualify	1
whether	0
you're	1
uh	0
an	1
an	1
[laughter-whether]	1
[laughter-you're]	0
[laughter-a]	0
[laughter-veteran]	1
or	1
whether	0
you	1
i	0
don't	0
even	0
know	1
if	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
perform	1
community	0
service	1
or	0
unless	1
uh	0
or	1
or	0
you	0
promise	1
to	0
even	1
do	0
something	0
in	0
the	0
future	1
i	1
think	0
that	1
uh	0
the	1
that	0
that	0
the	0
subsidy	1
itself	1
or	1
i	0
guess	1
the	0
enactment	1
of	0
that	0
form	1
of	0
legislation	1
would	1
give	0
many	1
people	0
who	1
i	0
i	1
think	1
i	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
perceive	1
the	0
fact	1
at	0

uh-huh	0

at	0
least	0
what	0
i	0
read	0
is	0
that	0
some	0
younger	1
people	0
feel	0
that	0
education	1
is	0
priced	0
out	0
of	0
their	1
uh	0
out	0
of	0
their	1
uh	0
budget	1
i	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
state	0
of	0
florida	0
just	0
today	0
uh	0
the	0
the	0
legislature	0
uh	0
adjourned	0
and	1
uh	0
they	0
had	0
completed	1
a	0
fifteen	1
per	0
cent	0
increase	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	1
uh	0
state	1
land	0
grant	0
colleges	1
which	1
which	0
isn't	1
i	0
mean	1
to	0
me	1
it	0
doesn't	0
sound	0
like	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
money	1
but	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
would	1
be	0
for	0
fifteen	0
hundred	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
they	0

uh-huh	0

they	0
went	0
from	0
eleven	1
to	0
fifteen	0
hundred	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
for	0
an	0
out	1
of	0
state	1
student	0
the	0
tuition	1
went	0
up	0
twenty	0
five	1
per	0
cent	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
what	0
that	0
would	0
be	1

yeah	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
raise	1
uh	0
community	1
college	0
taxes	0
here	1
a	0
few	0
years	1
ago	1
too	0

but	0
that	1
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
that	0
goes	0
along	1
with	0
the	0
general	0
idea	1
that	0
the	0
federal	1
government	0
had	0
to	1
uh	0
was	0
expending	1
so	1
much	0
money	0
on	0
defense	1
uh	0
that	1
that	1
the	1
program	0
now	1
is	0
a	0
uh	0
program	1
now	1
is	0
uh	0
fees	1
that	1
that	1
fund	1
these	0
things	1
i	0
guess	0
that's	0
trickled	1
down	0
to	0
the	0
states	1
and	1
the	0
states	1
now	0
establish	1
uh	0
don't	0
have	1
enough	0
money	1
so	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
they	1
they	0
must	0
charge	0
fees	1
uh	0
i	0
i	0
i'm	0
not	0
too	0
sure	0
of	0
that	0
reasoning	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	0
guess	1
to	0
get	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
main	1
topic	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
whether	1
i	0
pay	0
too	0
much	0
taxes	1
i	1
i	1
i	0
travel	1
extensively	0
in	0
europe	1
and	0
see	1
enormous	1
uh	0
people	0
p[ay]	1
pay	1
uh	0
a	0
great	0
deal	1
in	0
taxes	1
they	0
tell	0
me	0
when	0
i	0
sit	1
and	0
talk	0
to	0
people	0
there	0
they	0
tell	1
me	0
they	1
they	1
some	0
states	0
they	0
pay	0
uh	0
in	0
germany	1
or	0
in	0
in	0
england	1
in	0
some	1
cases	0
people	1
in	0
my	0
income	0
level	1
at	0
least	1
allege	1
that	0
they	0
pay	1
up	0
to	0
six	1
fifty	1
five	0
percent	0
of	0
their	1
gross	0
income	1
in	0
taxes	1

oh	1
oh	0
i	0
can	1
believe	0
that	1

but	0
but	0
i'm	0
not	1
too	0
sure	1
when	0
i	0
put	0
my	0
property	1
tax	0
in	1
my	0
car	1
tax	1
my	0
income	1
tax	1
and	1
these	0
myriad	1
of	0
uh	0
now	1
it	0
costs	0
me	0
money	1
to	0
leave	0
the	0
country	1
some	0
sort	0
of	0
a	0
tax	1
to	0
leave	0
the	0
country	1
some	0
sort	0
of	0
an	0
airport	1
departure	1
tax	1
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
tax	1
a	0
sales	1
tax	0
which	0
is	0
getting	1
to	0
uh	0
quite	0
high	0
levels	1

yep	0
yeah	0

i'm	0
not	0
sure	1
that	0
i'm	0
not	1
up	1
fairly	1
close	0
to	0
that	1

well	0
i	0
guarantee	1
you	0
you'd	0
be	0
paying	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
in	0
taxes	1
i[f]	1
if	0
uh	0
the	0
democrats	1
had	0
more	0
say	1

you	0
really	0
think	0
so	0

yeah	0
i	0
really	0
do	0

but	0
i	0
mean	0
w[hat]	0
what's	0
what's	0
happened	0
here	0
is	0
is	0
is	0
i	1
feel	0
that	0
that	0
in	0
the	0
last	1
ten	1
years	1
uh	0
my	0
taxes	1
have	0
gone	0
up	1
they	0
haven't	1
gone	0
down	1
i	0
pay	1
uh	0
quite	1
a	0
bit	0
more	0
taxes	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
and	0
and	0

every	0
everybody	0
is	0

but	0
that's	0
been	1
a	0
republican	0
government	1
for	0
the	0
last	0
ten	0
years	1

well	1
what	0
what	0
what	0
they've	1
been	0
able	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
slow	1
down	0
the	0
rate	0
of	1
increase	0
to	0
keep	0
it	0
to	0
keep	0
it	0
b[ecoming]	0
from	0
becoming	0
even	0
more	0
obnoxious	0

well	0
i	0

yeah	0

well	0
this	0
has	0
been	0
really	0
interesting	0
and	0
i've	0
enjoyed	1
our	0
talk	1

okay	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
just	0
push	1
something	0
here	1
push	0
one	0
again	0
right	0

no	0
you	0
just	0
uh	0
we	0
just	0
say	0
say	0
good-bye	0
and	0
that's	0
it	0

just	0
hang	0
up	0
okay	0
don	0
good	0
talking	0
with	0
you	0

nice	0
talking	0
with	0
you	0
too	0

bye-bye	0

bye-bye	0

i've	1
uh	1
i've	1
well	0
i've	0
had	1
i	0
used	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
there	1
wa[s]	1
that	1
there	0
really	1
wasn't	1
any	1
more	1
crime	1
in	1
america	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
anyway	1
than	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
previous	0
centuries	1
uh	0
before	1
uh	0
simply	1
because	1
the	0
reason	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	0
the	1
police	1
now	0
had	1
advanced	1
uh	0
reporting	0
methods	1
with	1
computers	1
and	0
other	1
devices	1

compile	1
more	1
statistics	1

that's	1
right	1
and	0
those	0
statistics	1
in	1
turn	1
got	0
them	1
bigger	1
budgets	1

um-hum	1

however	1
i	0
have	0
been	0
persuaded	1
lately	0
i	0
guess	1
simply	1
by	0
the	1
uh	0
overwhelming	1
data	0
that	0
seems	1
to	0
be	1
available	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	0
lot	1
more	1
violent	1
crime	1

more	0
especially	0
where	0
you	0
are	1
you	1
in	1
washington	1
dc	1
or	1
washington	1
state	1

well	0
yeah	1

no	0
i	0
am	1
in	1
i	0
am	0
in	0
washington	1
d	0
c	1

yeah	1
yeah	0
i	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
say	0

actually	0
it	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
do	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
business	1
here	1
and	1
i	1
come	1
here	1
quite	0
often	1
and	1
and	0
that	1
again	1
is	0
a	1
is	0
a	0
sort	1
of	0
media	0
perception	1
there's	0
some	1
absolutely	1
lovely	1
and	0
marvelous	1
and	0
peaceful	1
areas	0
in	1
washington	1
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
racial	1
makeup	1
but	0

oh	1
yeah	1

but	0
it's	0
it's	0
these	0
real	0
uh	0
there's	0
pockets	0
of	0
violence	1
that	0
is	0
so	1
violent	1
that	0
they	1
uh	0

it	0
just	0
really	0
grabs	1
your	0
attention	1
it	0

yeah	0

it	0
just	0
makes	0
the	0
whole	1
place	1
seem	0
like	0
that	1

right	1
now	1
just	1
to	1
focus	1
on	0
that	1
a	0
minute	1
i	1
guess	0
uh	0
um	1
when	0
um	1
previous	1
secretary	1
of	0
uh	1
educate	1
bennett	1
i	0
think	0
his	0
name	0
was	1
became	1
the	0
drug	1
czar	1
uh	0
for	0
uh	0
uh	1
president	1
bush	1
he	0
was	1
going	0
to	0
focus	1
on	0
it	1
on	1
this	0
area	1
and	0
do	1
something	1
about	1
it	1
and	1

yeah	0

and	1
i	1
see	0
that	1
even	1
he	1
was	1
met	0
without	1
with	1
with	1
little	0
success	1
even	1
though	1
the	0
entire	1
i	0
guess	1
a	1
a	0
quite	1
a	0
bit	0
of	0
money	1
and	1
and	1
other	1
uh	1
planning	1
efforts	1
went	1
into	0
that	1

what	0
do	0
you	1
what	0
do	0
you	0
think	1
is	1
is	0
causing	1
all	0
this	1
because	0

well	0

because	0
it	0
seems	0
that	0
there	1
there	1
even	0
though	1
crime	1
though	1
though	1
i	1
think	0
it	0
is	1
increasing	0
in	0
number	1
it	0
sure	0
does	1
seem	0
to	0
be	0
increasing	1
in	0
intensity	1
and	0
violence	1
too	1

yes	0

well	0
i	1
uh	0
i	0
have	1
three	0
theories	1
about	0
it	1
you	0
know	1
three	0
things	1
i	0
have	0
one	0
theory	0
and	1
it's	1
by	0
two	1
things	1
one	1
i	1
i	1
believe	1
that	0
this	0
is	1
a	0
function	1
of	1
uh	0
the	0
violence	1
that	1
young	0
people	1
see	1
on	0
television	1
and	1
in	0
the	1
movies	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	1
am	0
not	1
just	0
talking	1
about	1
you	0
know	0
uh	0
role	1
models	0
of	0
uh	0
of	0
tough	0
guys	1
and	0
gangsters	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
not	0
even	1
i'm	0
not	1
even	1
convinced	1
that	0
maybe	0
things	1
like	0
uh	0
football	1
hockey	1
and	0
the	1
the	0
and	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
the	1
the	1
and	1
even	0
baseball	1
games	1
now	1
where	1
the	1
everything	1
is	1
settled	1
with	0
a	0
fight	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
the	0
immediate	0
need	0
to	1
show	0
some	1
sort	0
of	0
violence	1
to	0
settle	1
the	0
uh	0
the	0
argument	1
and	1

and	1
and	1
then	0
i	1
i	0
am	1
an	0
advocate	1
of	1
hand	1
gun	0
control	1
to	0
some	0
degree	1
so	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
particularly	0
i	0
i	0
was	0
reading	1
the	0
other	0
day	1
about	0
uh	1
corpus	1
christi	0
texas	1
which	0
has	1
the	0
highest	1
i	0
think	1
it's	1
corp[us]	1
corpus	0
christi	1
that	1
had	0
the	0
highest	1
rates	0
per	1
hand	1
gun	0
death	0
in	0
america	1
uh	0
per	0
capita	1
i	0

hum	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	1
haven't	0
seen	1
that	1
but	1
uh	0

i	0
mean	0
the	0
saturday	0
night	0
special	0
stuff	0
so	0

yeah	1

that	1
that's	0
what	0
i	1
think	0
about	1
it	0
that's	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
i	0
think	0
about	1
it	0
plus	0
uh	0
i	0
know	0
what	0
are	0
your	0
views	0

well	0
yeah	0
i	0
tend	1
to	0
agree	1
with	0
you	0
with	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
seems	1
anymore	1
uh	0
a	0
movie	1
can	0
not	0
be	0
considered	1
good	1
unless	1
there's	0
just	0
some	1
some	1
sort	0
of	0
violence	1
or	0
something	0
in	0
it	1
and	0

yes	0

and	0
and	0
along	0
with	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
and	1
then	0
you	0
start	1
making	0
a	1
movie	1
and	1
it	1
it	0
has	0
no	1
there's	0
no	0
call	1
for	0
something	0
violent	1
but	0
so	0
they	0
just	0
throw	1
something	0
in	1
there	1
just	0
to	0
say	0
they	0
have	1
it	0

exac[tly]	0
well	0
that's	1
that's	1
that's	0
the	0
impression	1
i	0
get	1
yeah	0
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
i	1
and	0
i	0
imagine	1
it's	0
it	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
just	0
feeds	1
upon	0
itself	1
when	1
when	0
we	0
have	1
this	0
sort	0
of	0
violence	1
in	0
society	1
people	0
want	0
to	0
it	0
conditions	0
people	1
to	0
it	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
emph[asize]	0
it	1
has	0
to	0
be	0
even	1
uh	0
magnified	1
to	0
attract	1
people's	0
attention	1
i	0
guess	0
to	0
have	1
them	0
spend	0
money	1
on	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0
you	0
become	0
callous	0

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
am	0
sure	1
that	0
it	0
does	1
form	0
role	0
models	1
for	0
young	1
for	0
young	0
men	1
and	0
young	0
women	1
and	0

yeah	1

uh	0
i	1
mean	0
i	1
i	0
read	1
now	0
where	1
where	1
you	0
know	1
women	1
are	0
arr[ested]	1
young	0
women	0
are	0
arrested	1
fighting	0
with	0
knives	1
over	1
over	1
whatever	1
whatever	1
reason	1
which	0
is	1
kind	0
of	0
unheard	1
of	0
when	0
i	0
was	0
young	1
now	0

um	0

now	0
i	0
do	0
not	0
want	0
to	0
sound	1
like	0
an	0
old	0
fart	1
but	0
but	0
that	0
that's	0
what	0

seems	0
that	1
those	0
things	0
happened	0
before	1
it	0
didn't	1
happen	0
in	0
that	1
manner	1
before	0
television	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
i	1
i	1
i	0
have	1
to	0
think	1
that	0
that	0
it	1
has	0
some	0
influence	1
on	0
it	1
but	0

i	0
listening	1
to	0
a	0
radio	1
talk	0
show	1
today	0
at	0
lunch	1
time	1
uh	0
rush	1
limbaugh	1
i	0

yeah	0

i	0
do	0
not	0
know	0
if	0
you	1
listen	1
to	0
him	0
or	1
not	1
he's	1

no	0

he's	1
on	0
am	1
but	0
uh	1
there	1
there's	1
a	1
fellow	1
that	1
had	0
called	0
in	1
and	0
was	1
lamenting	1
about	1
the	1
uh	1
that	0
there	1
was	0
a	1
interview	1
done	0
on	0
the	1
assistant	1
chief	1
of	0
police	1
for	0
los	0
angeles	1
the	0
guy	1
under	0
gates	1

oh	0
yes	0

and	0
they	1
were	0
just	0
really	1
coming	1
down	1
on	0
him	0
because	0
of	1
some	0
of	0
the	1
things	1
he	0
was	1
just	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
he	1
believed	1
in	0
some	1
of	0
his	0
morals	1
for	0
instance	1
uh	0
they	0
asked	0
him	1
if	0
he	0
spanked	1
his	0
kids	1
and	0
he	0
said	0
you	0
bet	0
i	0
believe	1
in	0
discipline	1
and	0
people	1
i	1
i	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
they	0
confuse	1
confused	0
discipline	1
with	0
punishment	1

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
ju[st]	0
it	0
seems	1
anymore	1
that	0
uh	0
if	1
if	0
you	0
have	1
you	1
know	0
this	1
type	0
of	0
a	0
moral	1
stance	1
that	0
people	1
come	0
down	1
on	0
you	0
it's	0
like	1
you	0
know	1
hey	1
everybody	0
has	0
to	0
be	0
free	1
to	0
do	0
their	0
own	0
thing	1
and	0
i	0
disagree	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
that's	0
really	0
contributing	1
to	0
this	1
high	1
rate	0
of	0
crime	1

yes	0
yes	0
well	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
so	1
what	0
i	1
wanted	1
to	0
say	1
and	0
i	1
stopped	1
uh	0
i	0
do	1
not	0
know	1
i	1
got	0
diverted	1
was	0
uh	0
that	1
uh	0
there's	0
so	0
mu[ch]	1
there's	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
a	0
return	1
from	0
pris[on]	1
to	1
prison	1
that	0
the	0
rehabilitation	1
programs	1
seem	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
failure	1
and	1
and	1
that	1
is	0
not	0
emphasized	1
i	0
recognize	1
there's	1
there's	0
over	0
crowding	1
problems	1
and	1
and	0
since	1
we	0
have	0
decided	0
to	0
put	0
everybody	1
in	0
jail	1
that	0
commits	1
a	0
crime	0
now	1
that	0
that's	1
complicated	1
the	0
entire	0
process	1

yeah	0

what	0
i	0
also	0
think	0
is	0
that	0
i	0
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
the	0
reflection	1
of	1
of	0
the	0
society	1
where	1
where	1
we	0
have	0
so	1
much	0
more	0
mobility	1
and	0
less	1
attachment	1
to	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
it	0
does	0
not	0
seem	1
to	0
be	0
any	0
responsibility	1
to	0
the	0
community	1
where	0
you	1
where	0
you	0
live	1
or	0
i	0
do	0
not	1
mean	0
respons[ibility]	1
attachment	1
and	0
responsibility	1
i	0
guess	0
i	0
mean	1
any	0
sort	1
of	1

well	0
nobody	0
feels	1
responsibility	0
to	0
do	0
something	1
it's	0
like	0
oh	0
boy	1
i	0
wish	1
they	0
would	0
stop	1
doing	0
that	1
[laughter-yeah]	0

yes	0
that's	0
right	0
th[at]	0

[laughter-yeah]	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	0
do	0
not	0
know	0
how	0
that's	0
i	0
do	0
not	1
think	0
it's	0
done	0
by	1
uh	0
the	0
changes	0
come	1
simply	1
by	0
statutory	1
nature	1
i	0
do	1
not	0
know	0
what	1
it	0
really	0
will	0
take	1

hum	0

and	0
i	0
do	0
not	1
know	0
if	0
i	0
have	0
solutions	1
except	1
except	1
to	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
am	0
sort	1
of	0
a	1
a	0
an	0
advocate	1
of	1
of	0
uh	0
of	0
letting	1
people	1
of	0
having	1
free	0
speech	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
to	0
curb	1
uh	0
television	1
uh	0
the	0
violence	1
on	0
television	1
and	0
in	0
the	0
movies	1
would	0
be	0
contrary	1
to	0
my	0
beliefs	1
in	0
that	1

yeah	0

however	0
there	0
does	1
seem	0
to	0
be	0
a	1
right	0
now	0
in	0
verbalizing	0
it	0
does	1
seem	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
higher	1
need	1
for	0
something	0
of	0
that	0
sort	1

yeah	1
and	1
then	0
how	1
many	0

and	0
the	0
sacrifice	0
isn't	0
that	0
great	0

how	0
how	1
many	0
studies	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
to	0
show	1
that	0
there	0
is	0
a	0
link	1
between	1
you	1
know	0
what	1
you	0
see	1
and	0
how	0
you	1
i	0

yeah	0

i	0
mean	0
what	0
you	1
see	0
affects	0
how	0
you	0
think	0
and	0
therefore	0
what	0
you	0
do	0

yes	1
yes	0
i	1
think	0
i	0
think	1
that's	0
correct	1

and	0
and	0
yes	0
but	0
you	0
know	0
as	0
soon	0
as	0
you	0
start	0
uh	0

well	0
texas	1
has	1
uh	0
texas	1
has	0
uh	0
has	0
always	1
struck	0
me	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
i	1
i	0
have	0
lived	1
in	0
and	0
out	0
of	0
texas	1
both	0
in	0
the	0
service	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
uh	0
short	0
business	1
stints	1
and	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
me	0
they	0
are	0
a	0
pretty	1
pretty	1
tough	1
law	1
and	0
order	0
state	1
but	0
but	0
yet	1
that	0
does	1
not	0
seem	1
to	0
have	0
effected	1
the	0
amount	0
of	0
violent	1
right	0
in	0
the	1
state	1
just	0
citing	1
that	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	0
uh	0
unfortunately	1
you	0
man	0
got	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	1
uh	0
some	1
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
can	0
be	0
contributed	1
to	0
the	1
the	0
the	0
racial	1
differences	1
i	0
mean	0
just	1
you	0
know	0
we	0
are	0
so	0
close	1
to	0
the	0
border	1
with	1
mexico	1
we've	0

yeah	0

we've	0
got	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
that	1
influence	1

yeah	0

okay	0
so	0
the	0

all	1
right	1
what	0
have	1
you	1
seen	0

so	0
the	0
latest	1
movie	0
i've	1
seen	0
that	0
i	0
thought	1

i	1
knew	1
you	1
were	0
going	0
to	1

i	1
wanted	1
i	1
want	1
to	1

i	1
just	1
finally	1

uh	0
and	1
one	0
day	1
my	0
husband	1
had	1
the	1
kids	1
and	1
i	1
just	1
went	1
because	1
we	1
couldn't	1
we	1
could	1
never	1
get	0
to	1
go	1
see	1
it	1
together	1
because	1
it's	0
so	1
long	1
by	0
the	0
time	1
we	0
had	0
a	0
babysitter	1
for	1
that	1
[laughter-long]	0

gosh	1

so	1
i	1
finally	1
just	1
went	1
to	0
see	1
it	0
and	1
i	1
just	0
thought	0
it	1
was	1
fantastic	0

yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
i	1
watched	1
uh	0
costner	1
on	1

academy	1
awards	1
i	1
was	0
really	0
happy	1
that	0
he	0
got	1
i	0
was	0
hoping	1
he	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
get	0
best	1
actor	1

yeah	0
yeah	1

uh	0
but	0
he	1
he	1
he	1
did	1
pretty	1
good	1
on	0
that	1
one	1

that	0
was	0
quite	0
a	0
the	0
buffalo	0
scene	0
in	0
that	0
thing	0
was	0
so	0
real	0
it's	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

it's	0
like	1
i	1
mean	1
it	0
just	1
blew	1
me	1
away	1

yeah	0

several	1
of	1

out	1
right	0

that	1
i	0
want	1

of	0
the	0
lambs	0

yeah	1

uh	0
i'm	1
i'm	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	0
see	1
that	1
one	0
that	1
one	0
looks	0
so	1
scary	1
just	1
from	0
the	0
previews	1
i	0

i	0
thought	1
gosh	1
i'd	0
probably	1
have	0
nightmares	1
for	0
the	1
next	1
six	1
months	0

nah	0
nah	0

supposed	1
to	0
be	0

though	0
i	0

nah	0
people	0

i	0
know	1
some	0
friends	1
who	0
went	0
to	0
see	1
it	0

yeah	0

they	0
said	0
it	0
was	0
really	0
riveting	0

yeah	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
they	1
they	0
that's	1
what	0
they	0
said	0
about	0

[laughter-okay]	0

kid	1
and	0
i	0
thought	0
oh	0
[laughter-man]	0

well	0
i'll	0
tell	0
well	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	1
guess	1
it	0
was	0
because	0
i'd	1
read	0
the	0
book	1
before	1
i	0
saw	1
the	0
movie	1

oh	0
uh-huh	0

and	0
the	0
book	0
to	0
me	0
was	0
far	0
more	0
frightening	0
than	0
the	0
movie	0
was	0
yeah	0

oh	1
really	0
huh	0
gosh	0

yeah	0
he's	1
a	0
very	1
good	1
writer	1
and	0

had	1
a	0
way	1
of	0
putting	1
you	0
in	1
that	0
scene	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
was	0

oh	1
boy	1

and	0
of	0
course	1
i	1
was	0
i	1

living	1
alone	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	1

rats	1
in	0
the	0
attic	1
you	0
know	0

a	0
couple	1
of	0
others	1
that	0
are	0
out	1
and	0

and	0
i	0
can't	0
remember	0

i	1

i	0
thought	0

crummy	1
with	0
that	0
new	0
uh	0
michael	1
j	0
fox	0
movie	0
the	0
hard	1
way	0
where	1
he	0
plays	1
a	0
a	0
actor	1
that's	0
uh	1
like	1
th[e]	0
oh	0

yeah	0
i	1
i	1
didn't	0
i	1
didn't	1
even	1
like	0
the	1
previews	1
on	0
that	0

oh	0
i	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
well	1
i	0
ended	1
up	0
at	0
the	0
theater	1
and	1
there	0
was	0
didn't	0
seem	1
to	0
be	0
anything	1
else	0
on	0
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	0
so	0
i'll	0
try	0
that	0

but	0
it	0
wasn't	0
worth	0
anything	0
i	1
didn't	0
care	1
for	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

no	0

i	1
don't	0
i	1
don't	0
much	1
care	1
for	1
michael	1
j	1
fox	1
anyway	1

yeah	0
well	0
the	0
last	1
two	1
i	0
saw	1
him	1
in	0
one	1
of	0
those	1
back	1
to	0
the	1
future	1
part	1
three	1
deals	1
and	0
that	1
was	0
crummy	0
also	1
i	1
didn't	0
think	1
that	1
was	0
any	1
good	1
so	0

yeah	1

so	0

i	0
saw	1
the	0
original	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
future	1
and	1
then	0
i	0
i	1
know	1
i	1
hardly	1
ever	1
go	0
see	1
a	0

don't	0
think	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
the	0
movies	1
one	0
time	1

yeah	0
because_1	0
when	1
you're	0
touristing	1

probably	1
don't	0
want	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
time	1
to	0
go	0
see	0
a	0
movie	1
but	0

i	0
uh	0
where	1
i	0
lived	1
uh	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
little	0
town	1
called	0
newmarket	1
about	1
seventy	1
miles	0
north	0
of	0
london	1
and	0

there	1
and	0
we	1
use	0
to	0
go	0
go	0
out	0
to	0
that	1
about	0
once	1
a	0
week	0

oh	0
boy	0

yeah	0
a	0
really	0
nice	0
place	0
you	0
know	0
amateurs	0
but	0
really	0
quite	0
good	0

yeah	0

uh	0
that	0
that	0
was	0
interesting	0
course	0
used	0
to	0
go	1
to	0
london	1
quite	0
a	0
lot	1
and	0
see	0
shows	1
down	0

to	0
know	1
what	1
the	0

you	0
pour	0

or	0

just	0

over	1
the	0
uncooked	1

you	0
cook	1

guess	1
you	0
probably	1
could	0
do	0
it	0
some	0
way	0
but	0
cook	1
the	0
rice	0
and	0
then	0
take	1
a	0
can	1
of	0
like	0
cream	1
of	0
mushroom	0
soup	0
or	0
cream	0
of	0
chicken	1
soup	0

a	0
bit	0
of	0
white	0

while	0

i'll	0
slice	0
white	1
grapes	0
and	0
i'll	0
put	1
it	0
in	0
there	0
and	0

because_1	0
i'm	1
not	0
a	0
real	0
big	0
wine	1
person	0
but	0
i	0
like	1
it	0
it	0
it	0
adds	1
something	0
to	0
the	0
chicken	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

and	0
then	1
just	0
bake	1
it	0
and	0
it	0
makes	0
a	0
wonderful	1
sauce	1
over	0
the	0
rice	1

well	1

one	1
in	1
mind	0
too	1

[laughter-yeah]	0

that	1
was	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
first	1
things	0
i	0
made	1
for	0
my	0
husband	1
because_1	0
it's	0
like	0
hm	0
yeah	1

yeah	0

i	1
could	0
actually	0
find	1
something	0
i	0
could	0
cook	1
real	1
easy	1
that	0
would	0
be	1
kind	0
of	0
sort	1
of	0
elegant	1
kind	1
of	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
you	1
can	0
get	0
away	1
with	0
it	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
in	0
having	0
a	0
semi	1
nice	1
dinner	1
or	0

oh	0
yeah	0

or	0
you	1
know	0
semi	1
formal	0
but	0

but	0
then	1
i	0
di[dn't]	0
i	0
hadn't	0
thought	1
about	0
doing	0
it	0
with	0
uncooked	1
rice	0

yeah	0

so	0
just	0
like	0
in	0
a	0
thirteen	1
by	0
nine	0
pan	1

yeah	1
you	0
put	1
in	0
um	0
let's	1

hm	0

let's	1
see	0
what	0
was	1
it	0
three	1
quarters	0
of	0
cup	1
of	0
rice	1
or	0

hm	0

it	0
depends	1
on	0
you	0
can	0
really	0
vary	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

but	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
put	0
the	0
water	1
in	0
proportionally	1
i	0
can't	1
remember	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
was	0
three	1
quarters	0
cup	0
rice	1
to	0
two	1
cups	0
water	1
two	1
cups	0
um	0
broth	0

yeah	1
yeah	1
it's	0
i	1
i	1
use	0
that	0
for	0
brea[kfast]	0
for	0
rice	1
and	0
for	1
when	0
i	0
cook	0
pasta	1
or	0
something	0
i'll	0
i'll	0
put	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
bouillon	1
in	0
there	0
just	0
to	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
little	0
extra	1
flavor	0

yeah	1
that's	1
flavor	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0

hm	0
now	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
good	1

uh-huh	0

how	1
long	0
do	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
bake	1
it	0

um	0
let's	0
see	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
was	0
an	0
hour	1
i've	0
done	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
microwave	1
so	0
often	1
lately	1
because	0
it's	0
it's	0
really	1
easy	1

i	1
do	0
i	1
do	0
microwave	1
too	0
a	0
[laughter-lot]	1

yeah	0
but	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
about	1
an	0
hour	1

how	1
long	0
would	0
it	0
be	1
in	0
the	0
m[icrowave]	0
how	1
long	0
would	0
it	0
be	0
in	0
the	0
microwave	1

or	0
maybe	1
it's	0
only	1
half	1
hour	0

um	0
you	0
just	0
until	1
the	0
rice	1
looks	0
fluffy	1
and	0
and	0
not	0
overdone	1
you	0
know	1
before	1
it	0
gets	0
overdone	1

oh	0
okay	0

okay_1	0

do	0
you	0
just	0
brown	1
the	0
chicken	0
to	0
get	0
it	0
colored	1

yeah	1

or	0
do	0
you	0
go	1
ahead	0
and	0
let	0
it	0
cook	0
through	1

um	0
i'd	1
let	0
it	0
cook	1
just	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
just	0
so	0
that	0
the	0
cooking	1
goes	0
a	0
little	0
faster	1

okay	0

hm	0
oh	0
this	1
is	0
a	0
beneficial	1
call	0
i	1
like	1
this	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
well	0
i	1
liked	0
it	0
your	1
idea	0
too	1
there	0

yeah	0
but	0
that	1
one's	0
an	0
easy	1
one	0
it's	0
like	0
just	0
put	1
in	0
a	0
friend	0
of	1
mine	0
makes	1
it	0
where	0
she	0
goes	1
ahead	0
and	0
seasons	1
up	0
the	0
with	0
the	0
soup	1
and	0
the	0
wine	1

uh-huh	0

put	0
in	0
garlic	1
and	0
onion	1
powder	0
or	1
chopped	0
onions	1
if	0
you	0
wanna	0
do	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
wh[atever]	0
whatever	1
you	0
however	1
much	0
effort	1
you	0
feel	0
like	0
putting	1
into	0
it	0

yeah	0

uh-huh	0

but	1
it	0
it	0
makes	1
a	0
great	1
i	0
mean	0
m[y]	0
i've	1
got	0
a	0
two	1
year	0
old	0
and	0
a	0
four	1
year	0
old	0
and	0
they	1
love	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
be[cause]	0
because	0
my	0
daughter	1
calls	0
it	0
her	1
gravy	1
and	0
i	0
mean	0
she	1
thinks	0
it's	0
wonderful	1
i'm	0

i'm	0
like	0
good	1
you're	0
a	0
picky	0
eater	1
if	0
i	1
can	0
get	0
you	1
to	0
ea[t]	0

okay	1

[ok]ay	1
um	1
so	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
think	1
um	1
about	1
putting	1
an	1
elderly	1
in	0
a	1
nursing	1
home	0

well	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
it	1
varies	1
on	1
on	0
the	1
individual	1
basis	1

hm	0

uh	1
sometimes	1
it	1
is	0
there's	1
no	0
alternative	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
you	0
do	1
not	1
have	1
uh	0
uh	0
family	1
available	1
or	1
family	1
that's	0
uh	1
you	0
may	1
not	0
even	0
have	0
family	1
that	0
is	0
uh	0
in	1
and	0
who	0
around	1

that's	0
true	1
yeah	1

so	1
sometimes	1
it's	1
not	0
an	0
alternative	1

hm	0

and	0
i	1
think	1
uh	0
but	0
i	1
think	1
also	1
sometimes	1
it	1
can	0
be	1
uh	1
a	0
benefit	1
if	0
it's	0
for	0
a	0
short	0
time	1
sometimes	1
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0

um-hum	0

um	0
especially	1
after	0
if	1
it's	0
after	1
an	0
acute	0
illness	1
to	0
get	0
over	1
a	0
uh	0
or	0
to	0
rehab	1
after	0
uh	0
an	0
illness	1

that's	1
true	1
i	0
never	0
thought	1
of	0
that	0
yeah	0

sometimes	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
sometimes	1
the	0
nursing	1
homes	0
are	0
good	1
for	0
uh	0
just	1
short	1
periods	1
of	0
time	0

that's	0
true	1
until	1
they	0
get	0
over	0
that	0
hump	1
of	0
whatever	1
it	0
is	0
they're	0
dealing	1
with	0

um-hum	0

because	1
too	0
often	1
the	0
acute	1
hospitals	1
will	0
are	1
sending	0
them_1	0
out	1
much	1
faster	1
than	1
what	0
they're	0
really	0
able	1
to	0

yes	1

they	1
really	1
are	1
they	1
don't	0
like	0
to	0
keep	1
them	1
longer	1
than	1
a	0
week	0

so	1
so	0
there	0
is	1
some	0
good	1
to	0
it	0

yeah	1

uh	0
sometimes	0
too	1
it's	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
dumb	1
job	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
fam[ilies]	1
well	1
the	0
families	1
do	0
not	1
necessarily	1
uh	0
know	0
what	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
them_1	0
and	0

what	1
do	0
you	0
mean	1

and	0
they	0
don't	1
wanna	0
take	0
the	0
responsibility	1
so	0
they	0
will	0
put	1
them_1	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	0
home	0

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

so	0
you	1
see	1
uh	0
there's	0
both	1
sides	1
to	0
it	1
too	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
think	0

yeah	1
and	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
how	1
how	0
sick	1
the	0
person	1
is	0
too	1
and	0
what	0
you're	0
capable	1
of	0
like	0
if	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
family	1
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	0
know	1
of	0
your	0
own	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
um	0
i	1
would	0
personally	0
like	0
it	0
if	0
my	1
parents	0
were	0
to	0
get	0
ill	1
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
them	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
if	0
i	1
had	0
the	0
money	0
with	0
some	0
help	1
that's	1
not	0
always	0
possible	1

that's	0
true	1

but	1
um	0
to	0
the	0
best	1
of	0
my	0
ability	1
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
until	0
it	0
gets	1
impossible	1

i	1
think	1
that's	1
also	1
where	1
you're	1
gonna	1
to	0
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	0
are	1
going	1
to	0
it's	1
there's	0
not	0
a	1
choice	1
it's	0
because_1	1
there	0
it's	0
not	0
economically	0
feasible	1
even	0
to	0
put	1
them_1	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	0
home	0

right	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

so	0
that	0
that	1
option	1
sometimes	1
is	0
not	1
available	1
if	0
they	1
do	0
not	0
have	1
the	0
uh	1
either	0
medicare	1
or	0
insurance	1
to	0
cover	1
it	0

that's	0
true	1
yeah	0

so	1

but	1
i	1
think	0
nursing	0
homes	0
can	1
be	0
good	0
just	0
depends	0
on	0
what	0
kind	1
they	0
are	0
you	0
know	1
an	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
check	0
them_1	0
out	0
ahead	1
of	0
time	0

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
there's	1
also	1
some	1
that	0
are	0
set	1
up	1
for	0
specialties	1
uh	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
i	1
know	0
some	0
el[derly]	0
unfortunately	1
some	1
elderly	1
have	0
to	1
go	0
to	0
or	1
have	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
alzheimer's	1
or	0
where	0
they	1
wander	1
or	0
or	0
um	0
confused	1
or	1
have	0
some	1
mental	1
problems	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1
that	1
they're	1

and	1
you	0
need	1
a	1
special	1
nursing	1
home	0
for	0
that	1
you	0
need	1
one	1
that	0
has	0
a	0
unit	1
that's	0
locked	1
where	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	0
to	0
get	0
out	1
and	0
roam	0
around	1

yeah	1

and	0
you	0
need	0
people	1
who	0
are	0
trained	1
for	0
that	0
type	1
of	0
problem	1

right	1

an[d]	0
know	1
what	0
they're	0
doing	1
with	0
that	0

yeah	0
so	1
so	0
there's	0
different	1
types	1
of	0
nursing	0
homes	0
i	0
think	1

yeah	1
well	0
my	0
uh	0
grandmother's	1
not	1
really	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
but	0
a	0
retirement	1
home	0
that	0
also	0
has	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
sort	0
of	0
attached	1
to	1
it	0
and	1
she	1
really	0
liked	1
the	0
idea	0
of	0
of	0
moving	1
there	0
she's	1
not	0
ill	1
yet	1

um-hum	1

but	1
um	0
she	1
worked	0
there	0
as	0
a	0
volunteer	1
for	0
about	0
ten	1
years	1
and	0
then	0
she	1
decided	0
that	1
um	0
she's	0
eighty	1
five	0
years	0
old	1
that	0
eventually	1
you	1
know	0
she	1
she	0
doesn't	1
want	1
her	0
family	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
her	0
and	0
being	0
a	0
burden	1
she's	0
very	0
independent	1
so	0
she's	1
in	0
this	0
nursing	1
home	0
it's	0
out	0
in	0
the	0
country	1
and	1
um	0
she	0
really	1
enjoys	1
it	0
right	0
now	1
because	1
she	0
doesn't	1
have	0
to	0
wash	0
dishes	1
or	0
[laughter-cook]	1

gives	1
her	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
her	0
own	0
independence	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
she	0
still	1
has	0
uh	0
a	0
security	1
there	0

right	1
some	1
support	1
and	0
then	0
there's	0
also	1
a	0
sort	0
of	0
a	0
wing	1
for	0
those	1
people	0
that	0
do	1
get	0
sick	0
and	0
what	0
i	1
like	0
about	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
she	1
likes	0
about	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
she	0
knows	1
everybody	0
there	0
now	1
and	1
then	1
so	1
if	0
she	0
ever	0
does	1
become	0
ill	0
um	0
it'll	1
be	0
like	0
family	1
around	0
her	0

that's	0
right	1
and	0
i	0
i've	0
seen	1
some	0
of	0
them	0
like	0
that	0
too	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
also	1
they	0
have	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
activities	1
going	0
on	1
for	0
the	0
ones	0
who	0
are	0
more	0
active	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1
sh[e]	0

so	0
it's	0
not	1
sort	0
of	0
like	0
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
sick	1
place	0

um-hum	0

no	1
she	0
loves	1
it	0
she	1
had	0
a	0
great	1
social	1
life	0
and	0
she	0
travels	1
and	0
um	0
it's	0
in	0
in	0
missouri	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
mountains	1
and	0
it's	0
beautiful	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
i	1
hope	1
that	0
i	1
have	0
something	0
like	0
that	0
when	0
i	1
get	0
older	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
of	1
the	0
um	0
i	1
think	1
the	0
the	0
decision	1
that	0
needs	0
to	0
be	1
made	1
though	0
on	1
nursing	1
home	0
has	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
joint	1
one	0
between	0
the	0
the	0
uh	0
elderly	1
uh	0
person	1
who's	0
going	0
in	1
and	0
the	0
family	1
that's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
uh	0
effec[ted]	1
effected	1
by	0
it	0

um-hum	0

oh	0

oh	0
definitely	1
it's	0

and	0
uh	0
you	1
know	1
sometimes	1
it	1
can	0
those	0
choi[ces]	0
those	0
choices	1
can	1
be	1
made	0
in	0
advance	1
and	0
sometimes	1
the	0
choices	1
uh	0
because	0
of	1
the	0
nature	1
of	0
the	0
illness	0
when	0
they're	0

right	1

okay_1	1
so	1
what	1
are	0
what	1
are	1
your	1
views	1
o[n]	1
on	0
capital	1
punishment	1

i	1
have	1
ambivalent	1
feelings	1
because	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
it	1
serves	1
as	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
deterrent	1
we	0
would	1
like	0
to	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	0
hand	1
it	0
is	0
very	1
very	1
expensive	0
to	1
maintain	1
you	1
know	0
texas	1
has	0
one	0
of	1
the	0
biggest	1
criminal	1
justice	0
systems	0
in	1
the	0
country	0

yes	1

and	0
it's	0
eating	1
us	0
alive	1
budget	1
wise	0
and	0
um	0

so	1
are	0
they	1
currently	1
practicing	1
capital	0
punishment	1
in	0
your	0
state	0

yes	1
we	0
do	1
practice	1
capital	0
punishment	1

but	1
the	0
nature	1
of	1
the	0
uh	1
courts	1
and	1
the	1
appeals	1
and	0
the	1
stays	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
means	1
that	0
it's	1
a	0
very	1
long	0
haul	0
before	1
anybody's	0
ever	0
executed	1

yes	1
that's	0
similar	1
to	0
georgia	1

yeah	0
and	0
then	1
i	1
was	0
reading	1
in	0
the	0
paper	1
just	0
this	0
morning	1
it's	1
interesting	1
because_1	1
i	0
had	1
forgotten	1
i	0
guess	1
that	1
i	0
wrote	0
this	0
little	1
topic	0
down	1
that	1
it	0
costs	0
more	1
to	1
execute	1
somebody	1
tha[n]	0
than	1
it	1
does	1
to	0
keep	1
them_1	0
because	1
of	0
all	0
the	1
costs	1
of	1
the	0
appeals	1
and	0
all	1
that	0
you	0
know	1

that's	0
probably	0
true	1
considering	1

yes	1

yes	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	0
it	0
it	0
kind	1
of	0
defeats	0
the	0
purpose	1
of	0
having	1
capital	0
punishment	0
if	0

well	1
i	0
think	1
capital	0
punishment	0
is	0
supposed	1
to	0
be	0
primarily	1
a	0
deterrent	1
to	0
other	0
people	1
you	1
know	1
who	0
would	1
see	1
it	0

yes	1

right	1
that	1
would	0
be	0
the	0
intent	1
of	0
it	0

yeah	1
but	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
how	0
successful	1
that	1
is	1

well	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
would	1
be	0
more	0
successful	1
if	1
it	0
was	1
applied	1
in	0
a	0
more	0
expedient	1
manner	1
if	0
there	0
weren't	1
so	1
many	1
appeals	1

quicker	1
maybe	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
if	0
if	0
the	1
person	1
who's	0
gonna	1
commit	0
the	0
crime	1
knew	1
that	0
they	0
were	0
gonna	0
be	0
punished	0
severely	1
possibly	0
capital	0
punishment	1

um-hum	0

what	0
what	1
kind	0
of	0
work	1
do	0
you	0
do	0

uh	1
i'm	1
a	1
research	1
engineer	1
i	0
work	1
uh	1
f[or]	1
with	0
georgia	1
tech	1

hum	0
well	1
see	0
i'm	1
a	0
school	0
principal	1

um	1

elementary	1
school	1

yes	1

and	1
in	0
a	0
very	1
poor	1
section	0
of	1
town	1
with	1
pr[edominantly]	0
predominantly	1
anglo	1
kids	1
and	0
i	1
see	0
kids	0
already	1
that	1
are	0
gonna	0
be	1
criminals	1
in	0
spite	1
of	0
everything	1
we	0
can	0
do	1

hum	0

and	0
see	0
i'm	1
afraid	1
i	1
think	0
if	1
we	0
would	0
take	0
the	1
equivalent	1
amount	0
of	0
money	0
and	0
invest	1
it	0
in	0
young	1
people	0
that	0
i	0
mean	1
course	0
you	0
couldn't	0
do	1
that	0
because_1	0
you	0
got	1
to	0
do	0
something	0
with	0
the	1
ones	0
that	1
are	1
already	0
there	1

um-hum	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
if	1
we	0
would	1
make	0
a	0
bigger	1
investment	1
in	1
kids	1
we'd	1
have	1
fewer	1
decisions	1
to	1
make	1
down	0
the	0
road	1
you	0
know	1

um	0
that's	0
probably	0
true	1
but	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	0
other	1
factors	0
that	0

oh	1
yeah	0

but	0
pu[mping]	1
pu[mping]	1
pumping	1
more	0
money	0
into	0
the	1
school	1
system	0
is	1
a	0
good	1
thing	0
but	1

well	1
i'm	1
not	0
talking	0
about_1	0
just	1
in	0
the	0
school	1
system	0

but	1
it's	0
not	1
gonna	0

oh	0
i	1
see	1

see	0
i'm	1
talking	0
about_1	0
like	0
in	0
in	0
uh	0
i'm	1
afraid	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
kids	1
who	0
just	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
taken	0
out	0
of	0
their	0
homes	1
and	0
reared	1
uh	0
i	0
know	0
institutions	1
don't	0
work	0
that	0
well	1
but	0
it's	0
a	0
bad	1
day	1
[laughter-because_1]	0
[laughter-because_1]	0
i	1
have	0
all	1
these	0
kids	0
through	1
my	0
office	1
i	1
have	0
a	0
school	0
of	0
five	0
hundred	1
and	0
thirty	0
seven	0
kids	1

um-hum	0

five	1
hundred	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
good	1
solid	0
kids	0
and	0
i	1
have	0
the	0
same	1
thirty	0
seven	1
in	0
my	0
office	0
every	1
day	0

um	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
their	0
parents	1
are	0
totally	1
irresponsible	1
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
in	0
the	0
penal	1
system	0

so	0
that's	1
a	1
difficult	1
situation	1

and	1
you	1
know	0
you	1
just	1
see	0
those	1
kids	0
going	0
down	0
the	0
road	1
now	0
not	0
all	1
of	0
them_1	0
will	0
commit	0
offenses	1
that	0
have	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
capital	1
punishment	0
but	0
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
have	0
already	0
been	0
in	0
youth	1
centers	0
and	1
that	1
kind	0
of	1
thing	0
and	0

um	0

and	0
if	0
we	1
had	0
something	1
to	0
do	1
before	1
they	1
get	0
to	0
be	1
full	1
blown	0
adult	0
criminals	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
talking	1
about_1	0
necessarily	0
in	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
that	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
should	0
be	1
the	0
agent	0
of	0
all	1
the	0
social	1
action	1

um-hum	0

i	1
think	0
that's	0
one	1
reason	0
we	0
have	0
problems	1
in	0
school	0
sys[tems]	0
uh	0
and	1
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
our	1
problems	1
but	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
it's	0
because	1
everything	0
society	0
wants	1
we're	1
supposed	0
to	0
do	1

um-hum	1

but	1
that's	1
another	1
subject	0
but	1

well	0
that's	1
probably	0
true	1
wh[at]	0

anyway	1
i	1
dealt	0
with	1
two	0
or	1
three	0
kids	0
today	1
that	0
are	1
gonna	0
end	0
up	1
where	0
somebody	1
has	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
decision	1
what	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
them_1	0

hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
not	0
an	0
easy	0
solution	1
there's	0
there's	0
no	0
easy	0
solution	1
for	0
that	1

um-hum	0

i	1
don't	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
there	0
is	1
an	0
easy	0
solution	0
but	0
if	1
you	0
could	0
find	1
a	0
way	0
to	0
prevent	1
some	0
of	0
it	0
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
what	0
it	0
would	0
be	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
money	1
better	0
spent	1
than	0

um-hum	0

do	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
costs	1
more	1
to	0
keep	1
an	0
inmate	1
on	1
death	1
row	1
than	0
it	0
does	0
to	0
send	0
a	0
kid	0
to	0
harvard	1

that's	0
true	1

i'm	0
sure	0
it	0
is	1
yeah	1

statistically	1
that's	0
true	1

hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
certainly	1
capital	0
punishment	0
isn't	0
gonna	0
solve	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
problems	1
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0

are	0
you	1
for	0
it	0

uh	0

i'm	1
for	0
it	0
in	0
in	0
some	1
cases	1

i	0
guess	1
i	0
am	1
for	0
certain	0
cri[mes]	0
yeah	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
in	0
certain	1
crimes	0

what	0
kind	0
of	0
crimes	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
use	1
it	0
for	0

um	0
premeditated	1
murder	1
crimes	0
of	0
that	1
nature	0
i	0
think	0
should	0
definitely	1

um-hum	0

any	0
mass	1
murderer	1
type	0
individual	0

i	1
i	1
would	1
consider	1
it	0
for	0
sexual	1
abuse	0
of	0
children	1
on	1
going	1
you	1
know	0
not	1
one	0

hum	0

um-hum	0
well	0
you	0
always	1
have	0
[laughter-castration]	1

well	0
you	1
know	0
somebody	1
elected	1
that	0
recently	0

yes	1
i	0
read	1
about	0
that	1

and	0
all	1
the	0
civil	0
rights	1
people	0
are	0
up	0
in	0
arms	1
about	0
it	0
you	0
know	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0

uh	1
being	1
a	1
former	1
drug	1
user	1
i	1
uh	1
i'd	1
i	1
guess	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
approve	1
of	1
it	1

whoa	1

uh-huh	0

uh	1
because	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
uh	0
in	1
using	1
drugs	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
employee	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
so	1
i	1
can	0
see	1
from	0
the	1
company's	1
standpoint	1
that	1
there	1
uh	0
whenever	1
you	1
are	1
an	0
employee	1
of	1
the	0
company	1
you	0
are	0
using	1
it's	0
assets	1
and	1
uh	0
a[nd]	1
bu[t]	1
you're	0
also	1
under	1
their	0
liability	1
under	1
the	1
workmen's	1
comp	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
on	1
my	1
job	1
we	1
had	0
a	1
lot	0
of	0
workmen's	1
comp	0
cases	1
and	1
uh	0
i	0
work	1
for	0
a	0
tire	1
company	1
modern	1
tire	1

where	1
do	0
you	0
work	1

oh	1

and	1
uh	0
it's	0
also	1
a	0
retreading	1
plant	1
and	0
that's	1
where	0
most	0
of	1
our	1
uh	0
injuries	1
occur	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
what	0
we	1
do	1
is	0
we'll	0
have	0
a	0
drug	1
test	0
i[f]	1
if	1
an	1
if	1
a	1
a	0
boy	1
or	0
a	1
man	1
uh	1
has	1
an	0
accident	1
then	1
he's	1
automatically	1
uh	0
given	0
a	0
drug	1
test	1

right	1
do	0
they	0
do	1
it	1
like	1
you	1
know	1
within	0
hours	1
of	0
the	0
accident	1
or	0
is	0
it	1

yes	1
when	1
he	0
goes	1
to	0
the	0
doctor	1
the	0
first	1
time	1

yeah	0

and	1
so	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
uh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
been	1
a	1
deterrent	1
or	0
not	1
because	0
we	1
have	0
uh	0
just	1
started	0
using	1
it	0
oh	1
for	0
the	0
past	0
year	1
or	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

now	1
we've	1
let	1
some	1
people	0
go	1
uh	0
that	0
well	0
it	1
was	1
found	0
that	0
drugs	1
were	0
used	1
in	1
their	0
system	1
now	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
how	1
tec	1
would	1
handle	1
it	1
they	1
haven't	0
pursued	1
it	0
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

uh	0
if	1
there's	1
some	1
uh	1
problem	1
i	1
know	1
there	1
was	0
one	1
guy	1
that	1
we	1
tested	1
for	1
preemployment	1
for	1
drugs	1
who	1
absolutely	1
swore	1
up	0
and	1
down	1
that	1
it	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
was	0
using	1
amphetamines	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
a	1
separate	1
drug	0
testing	1
firm	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
they	1
showed	1
it	1
negative	1

huh	1

so	1
i	1
think	1
the	0
tests	1
themselves	1
are	1
not	1
really	0
that	1
cut	1
and	1
dried	1
you	1
know	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
probably	0
true	1
too	1
that's	1
that's	1
that's	1
sort	0
of	0
scary	1

uh-huh	1
really	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
also	1
had	0
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	1
uh	0
just	0
around	1
some	0
people	1
that	1
were	1
smoking	1
cocaine	1

yeah	1

and	0
he	1
tested	0
positive	0
on	1
cocaine	1
now	1
then	1
you	0
always	1
wonder	1
well	1
is	0
he	1
just	1
saying	0
that	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
yeah	1
really	1
really	1

yeah	0

yeah	1
that's	1
that's	1
a	0
bad	1
situation	1
i	1
think	0
that	0
probably	1
i	1
think	0
most	1
companies	0
now	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
entry	1
you	1
know	0
exams	1
require	1
that	0
i	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

i	1
think	0
they	0
should	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	1
a	0
ti	1
employee	1
and	1
and	1
and	1
uh	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
really	0
gung	1
ho	0
for	1
it	0
in	0

uh-huh	0

in	0
fact	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
places	1
now	1
um	0
like	0
ibm	1
don't	1
allow	1
even	0
smoking	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
plant	1

uh-huh	0

right	1

we	1
we	1
have	0
designated	1
smoking	1
areas	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
work	1
in	0
sort	1
of	0
a	0
building	1
that's	0
that's	0
not	1
really	1
it	1
well	0
it's	0
on	1
the	0
campus	1
of	1
the	0
ti	0
facility	1
but	0
it's	0
a	0
little	1
bit	1
you	1
know	0
separated	1
we	0
lease	1
the	0
building	1
and	0
it's	0
m[ainly]	0
it's	0
a	0
factory	1
environment	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	1
they	1
they	0
have	0
designated	1
smoking	1
but	0
it's	0
just	0
wide	1
open	1
it's	0
not	1
ventilated	1
properly	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
i	0
think	1
that's	1
bad	1
but	0
as	1
far	1
as	0
the	0
drugs	1
you	1
know	0
being	1
in	1
the	0
factory	1
kind	1
of	1
environment	1
that	0
way	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
a	0
it's	0
a	0
definite	1
i	1
think	0
it's	0
essential	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

yeah	1
because	0
you're	1
endangering	1
everybody's	1
lives	1
if	0
you've	0
if	0
it's	0
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	1

in	1
fact	1
we've	0
had	1
the	0
policy	1
on	0
just	0
the	1
random	1
testing	1
now	1
for	1
a	0
couple	1
years	1

uh-huh	1

know	0
they	1

they	1
never	1
they	1
never	0
called	1
me	0
they	1
never	1

finally	1
the	0
day	1

a	0
high	1
risk	0
group	1

the	0

them	1
out	0
when	0
we	0
started	1
you	1
know	0
that	0
they	1
were	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
all	0
them	0
first	1

the	0
executives	1

away	1
from	0

really	1

cause	0
that's	1
really	1
downward	1
spiral	1

it's	1

life	1
is	0
so	1
much	0
more	0
enjoyable	1

uh-huh	0
and	0
i	1
was	0
losing	1
jobs	1
just	0
from	0
doing	0
a	0
poor	1
job	1
you	1
know	1

yeah	1

that's	1
that's	0
it	1

i	0
mean	1
you	1
know	1
there's	1
all	0
kinds	1
of	0
drawbacks	1
much	0
less	1
the	0
drug	1
testing	1

yeah	1
just	0
life	1
in	0
general	1

uh-huh	0
that's	0
right	1

definitely	1
for	1
it	0

yeah	1

plus	1
you	0
know	1
you	1
you	0
want	1
to	0
think	1
that	0
that	0
you're	0
working	1
with	0
people	1
who	1
are	0
not	0
only	0
putting	1
out	0
their	0
fair	0
share	1
but	0
that	0
are	0
not	1
endangering	1
your	0
life	1
in	0

that's	0
right	1

in	0
some	0
cases	1
like	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	1

like	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	1
uh	0
several	1
years	0
back	1
worked	0
for	0
motorola	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	1
had	1
you	0
know	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
was	1
a	0
chemical	1
handling	1
type	1

oh	0
goodness	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	1
and	0
they	0
have	1
they	1
have	0
some	0
serious	1
chemicals	1
out	0
there	1
you	1
know	0
like	1

yeah	1

like	1
they	0
have	1
emergency	1
shower	1
where	0
you	0
just	0
run	1
in	0
there	1
and	0
strip	1
off	1
and	0
dump	1
water	1
you	1
know	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1

yeah	1

and	0
they	1
had	0
people	0
out	0
there	1
using	0
all	0
sorts	1
of	0
drugs	1
handling	1
those	0
chemicals	1

oh	1
my	0
gosh	1

you	0
know	0
that's	1
really	1
that's	1
really	0
frightening	1
so	0

yeah	1

so	0
i	1
think	0
some	0
place	1
you	1
know	0
places	1
like	0
that	1
it	0
should	0
be	1
like	1
mandatory	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
on	0
on	1
a	0
on	0
a	0
greater	1
frequency	1
than	1
than	0
maybe	1
just	0
you	1
know	0
the	1
paper	0
pushers	1
like	1
like	0
i	1
am	0

uh-huh	1

right	1

i	0
would	0
think	1
they	0
would	1
be	0

well	1
you	0
well	1
you'd	0
think	1
so	1
but	1
uh	1

but	1
they	0
weren't	1

i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
[un]til	0
yet	1

isn't	1
that	0
awful	1

because	1
when	0
he	1
was	0
at	0
course	1
now	0
it's	1
been	0
years	1
now	0
because	0
it	1
was	0
before	1
it	1
was	0
even	0
before	1
they	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
designated	1
smoking	1
type	0
stuff	1
you	0
know	0
at	0
ti	1
i	0

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

i	0
forgot	0
what	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
like	1
eighty	1
four	1
eighty	0
five	1
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	1
at	0
that	1
time	1
they	1
had	0
no	0
testing	1
whatsoever	1

huh	0

so	1
that's	1
scary	1

yeah	1
that's	1
reminds	1
me	0
of	0
uh	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	0
telling	0
me	0
about	0
her	0
brother	1
who	0
gets	0
high	1
all	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
have	1
just	0
casually	1
asked	1
her	0
what	0
he	0
did	0
for	0
a	0
living	1
and	0
she	1
said	1
oh	0
he's	0
the	0
supervisor	1
of	0
this	0
chemical	1
land	1
fill	0
you	0
know	1
where	0
they	0
go	1
and	0
dump	1
all	0
this	1
toxic	1
stuff	1

oh	1
lord	1

oh	1

and	1
i	0
just	1
you	0
know	1
went	0
oh	1
[laughter-where]	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
yeah	1
should	0
we	0
move	1

let	1
me	0
move	1
as	0
far	1
away	0
as	0
possible	1

ooh	1

yeah	1

that's	0
awful	1

but	1
i'm	0
proud	1
though	0
that	1
that	1
um	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
grew	1
up	0
in	0
the	1
sixties	1
and	1
back	0
then	1
it	0
was	0
popular	1
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

but	0
people	1
have	0
really	1
wisened	1
you	1
know	0
become	1
wise	1
about	0
drugs	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
they	0
really	1
have	0
a	0
good	1
campaign	1
for	0
the	0
young	1
people	1
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

they	0
know	1
it's	0
not	0
smart	1
so	1
so	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
a	0
generational	1
thing	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
peer	1
group	1
is	0
the	1
other	0
way	1
now	1
instead	1
of	0

that's	0
right	1
and	0
that's	1
good	1

uh-huh	0
that's	1

that's	0
the	0
best	1
way	1
to	0
stop	1
it	0

yeah	1
that	1
it	0
really	1
is	1

yeah	1
well	1
i	0
think	1
we	0
did	1
it	0

[laughter-okay]	1
well	0

it's	0
good	1
talking	1
to	0
you	1

well	0
i	1
enjoyed	0
talking	1
talking	1
to	0
you	0
cathy	1

yeah	1
bye-bye	1

you	1
wanna	1
go	1
first	1

no	1
you	1
can	1
start	1

okay	1
um	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
they	1
talked	1
about	1
was	1
uh	1
did	1
we	1
di[d]	1
wha[t]	1
do	1
what	1
do	0
we	1
think	1
about	0
a	0
judge	1
making	0
the	0
decision	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
really	1
don't	0
agree	1
with	0
that	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	1
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
is	0
better	1
uh	1
you	1
know	1
than	1
e[ven]	0
having	1
a	1
unanimous	1
decision	1
rather	1
than	0
to	1
have	0
one	1
person	1
be	0
responsible	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
objective	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
every	1
time	1

right	1

y[ou]	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
i	1
mean	1

right	1
there's	1
there	1
th[is]	0
thi[s]	1
this	1
topic	0
is	1
kind	0
of	0
moot	1
um	0
there	1

yeah	1

there	1
there's	0
no	0
way	1
we	1
we	1
couldn't	0
survive	1
in	1
a	0
sy[stem]	0
in	1
a	1
in	0
a	1
juror	1
syst[em]	0
in	1
a	0
trial	1
system	1
without	1
a	0
jury	1

right	1

um	1
one	1
man	0
can	1
never	1
be	0
one	0
man	1
one	0
woman	1
can	0
never	1
be	0
objectionable	1
in	1
every	1
case	0

that's	0
it	1

um	1
every	1
person	1
has	1
their	1
opinions	1
and	1
that's	1
why	1
jury	1
selection	0
is	0
often	1
very	0
difficult	1
um	1

well	0
i	1
i	0
feel	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
too	1
uh	0
they	1
were	0
saying	1
uh	1
you	1
know	0
what	1
new	1
ways	1
could	1
you	1
could	1
it	1
you	1
you	1
know	0
change	1
the	0
system	1
i	1
i	0
really	1
think	1
that	1
um	1
we	1
spend	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
time	1
uh	1
going	1
through	1
appeal	1
after	1
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
i	0

i	0
mean	0
i[f]	1
if	0
you	1
go	1
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
and	0
especially	1
if	0
a	0
person	1
has	1
confessed	1
if	0
they	1
have	1
been	0
caught	1
you	1
know	0
point	1
blank	1
in	1
the	0
crime	1
there's	1
uh	0
no	1
question	1
it's	0

right	1

it's	0
beyond	1
a	0
reasonable	1
doubt	1
you	0
all	1
these	0
things	1
i	1
mean	0
you	1
know	1
we've	1
gone	1
through	0
this	1
uh	0
over	1
and	0
over	1
again	0

right	1
they	1
shouldn't	0
allow	1
an	0
appeal	1

and	1
it	1
can	0
go	0
on	1
for	0
ten	1
twenty	1
years	1

yep	1

i	0
i	1
think	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
little	1
ridiculous	1

[laughter-um-hum]	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
only	1
people	0
who	1
benefit	1
from	0
that	0
are	0
the	0
lawyers	1

no	1
that's	0
right	1
i	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
law	1
firm	1
[laughter-i]	1
[laughter-ought]	0

i	1
i'm	0
serious	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
lawyers	1
have	0
caused	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
problems	1
tha[t]	1
ha[ppen]	1
that	1
exist	1
in	0
the	1
in	1
the	0
criminal	1
system	0
today	1
with	0
plea	1
bargaining	1

right	1

you	1
know	0
if	0
someone	1
is	0

well	1
plea	1
bar[gaining]	1
plea	1
bargaining	1
is	0
a	0
different	0
story	1

well	1

plea	1
bargaining	1
is	0
something	0
completely	0
different	1
that	1
that	1
actually	0
prevents	1
trials	0
or	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
speeds	1
them_1	0
up	1

well	1
i	0
know	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	1
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
all	1
of	0
the	0
whole	0
criminal	1
system	1
is	0
messed	1
up	1
in	1
in	1
that	1
regard	1
i	1
mean	1
you	1
know	1
people	1
who	1
commit	1
uh	0
crimes	1
that	0
they	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	1
it	1
works	1
exactly	1
but	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	0
lesser	1
sentences	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
understand	0
that	0
the	0
jails	1
are	0
full	0
of	0
people	1
you	0
know	1
uh	1
and	0
that	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
do	0
something	1

right	1

but	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
reason	1
they	0
are	1
full	0
is	0
because	1
they	0
know	1
that	0
they	1
can	1
get	1
away	1
with	0
it	0

hum	1

you	0
you	1
know	0
what	1
i'm	1
saying	1
tha[t]	0
we	1
we	1
don't	0
have	1
um	1
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
states	0
don't	1
have	0
capital	0
punishment	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
i	1
think	1
they	0
should	1

we	1
do	0

i	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
if	0
a	0
person	1
is	0
guilty	1
of	0
taking	1
someone's	0
life	1
and	0
like	0
you	0
say	1
it's	0
it's	0
there's	0
no	1
doubt	1
whatsoever	0
like	0
drunk	0
drivers	1
that	0
kill	1
people	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
all	1

right	1

they	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	1
i	0
i	1
just	0
think	1
that	0
that's	1
they've	0
they've	1
taken	1
a	0
life	1
and	0
if	1
they	1
should	0
pay	1
for	0
it	0
with	0
their	1
life	1

right	1
when	1
you're	0
saying	1
as	0
as	0
far	1
as	1
the	0
appeal	1
um	1
procedure	1
is	0
concerned	1

yeah	1

we	1
just	0
have	0
the	0
case	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
you've	0
probably	0
heard	1
of	0
marion	1
berry	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
his	1
fi[nal]	0
his	0
last	1
appeal	1
was	1
was	0
denied	1
two	1
days	0
before	0
his	0
sentence	1
was	0
up	1

oh	0
really	1

so	1
i	1
mean	1
his	0
appeal	1
was	1
denied	1
and	1
two	1
days	1
later	1
he	1
got	0
out	1
of	1
jail	1
for	0
cocaine	1
possession	1

it	1
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
that	1
was	1
absurd	1
there	0
was	1
no	0
there	1
was	0
no	1
reason	0
the	1
appeal	1
process	0
should	0
have	1
dragged	1
on	0
that	0
long	1
for	1
a	0
six	1
month	0
sentence	1

i	1
know	0
that	1
the	1

uh-huh	1
an[d]	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
wha[t]	0
what	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
to	1
change	1
it	0
to	0
make	1
it	0
better	1

well	1
uh	0
the	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	0
can	1
i	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
the	1
the	0
appeal	1
procedure	1
is	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	1
can	0
possibly	0
think	1
of	0
um	1
i	0
like	1
i	0
said	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
removing	1
of	0
the	0
jury	1
and	0
having	1
the	0
judge	1
sentence	0
that's	1
absurd	0
there's	1
no	0
way	0
that	1
could	0
work	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
don't	0
agree	1
with	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	1
but	1

imagine	1
the	0
guilt	1
that	0
person	0
would	0
have	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
burned	1
out	1

oh	1
exactly	1

is	1
there's	0
no	0
possible	1
way	1
that	0
you	1
could	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
feel	0
good	1
about	0
yourself	1

exactly	1

right	1

if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
do	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
day	1
after	0
day	1

no	1
one	0
would	0
want	1
the	1
job	1

no	1
rea[lly]	1
not	0
really	1

um	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
like	0
i	1
said	1
the	1
you	0
know	1
everyone	1
has	0
their	0
opinions	1
about	0
every	0
case	1

well	0
wou[ld]	0
do	0
you	1
think	0
people	1
should	0
have	1
a	0
trial	1
if	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	1
like	1

oh	1
yeah	0
i	0
i	0
feel	1
that	0
everyone	1
is	0
everyone	1
is	0
um	1
entitled	1
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
that	1
that	1
that	0
right	1
sh[ould]	0

i	1
mean	0
supposing	1
i	1
come	0
up	0
to	0
you	1
and	0
i	0
just	0
point	1
blank	1
kill	1
you	0

well	1
i	0
mean	1
were	0
there	0
witnesses	1

in	0
other	1
words	1
you're	0
saying	1
that	0
we	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
whether	0
it's	0
premeditated	1
or	1
what	1
the	0
circumstances	1
were	1

right	1

right	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
you	0
can't	1
remove	0
the	0
jury	1
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
case	1

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
you	1
could	0
have	0
fifty	1
people	1
in	0
audience	1
watching	1
a	0
murder	1
take	0
place	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
you	1
you'd	0
still	1
there's	0
still	1
mitigating	0
circumstances	1

well	0
it's	0
i	1
i	1
feel	0

okay	1

okay	1
i	1
thought	0
it	1
was	0
supposed	1
to	1
give	0
a	0
recording	1
but	1
anyway	1
um	1
well	1
i	0
i	0
do	1
take	0
care	0
of	0
pretty	0
much	1
[laughter-all]	1
of	1
the	0
stuff	1
for	0
for	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
um	1
i	1
embarrassed	1
to	1
say	0
it's	1
pretty	1
trivial	1

um-hum	0

all	1
we	1
all	1
i	1
do	1
is	1
uh	1
keep	1
a	0
list	1
of	1
things	1
like	0
debts	1
that	1
are	0
outstanding	1
and	0
and	0
every	1
two	0
or	0
three	1
months	0
update	1
that	1
and	0
every	1
once	1
in	0
a	1
while	1
make	0
a	1
list	1
of	0
what	1
we	1
spent	1
that	1
month	1
but	1
i	0
doubt	1
i	1
do	0
it	1
more	1
than	0
three	0
times	0
a	0
year	1

um-hum	0
do	1
you	0
use	0
a	1
computer	1

and	1

no	1
i	1
work	1
with	1
them_1	0
all	0
day	0
yeah	0
i'm	0
in	0
computer	0
science	1
yet	0
i	0
i	0
do	0
everything	0
on	0
paper	1

oh	0

uh-huh	1

uh	0
i	1
don't	1
even	1
use	0
a	0
calculator	1
for	0
the	1
stuff	0
i'm	1
doing	1
because_1	1
it's	1
all	1
pretty	0
round	1
numbers	0

yeah	1
mine	1
is	1
really	0
simple	1
because	0
i	1
got	0
all	1
our	0
bills	0
paid	0
off	1
when	1
um	1
he	1
was	1
a	0
marine	1
he	1
went	1
to	0
saudi	1
arabia	1
and	1
while	0
he	1
was	1
gone	1
i	1
got	0
all	1
of	0
our	1
bills	1
paid	1
off	1
so	1
really	1
the	1
only	1
bills	1
i	1
have	1
is	0
rent	1
utilities	1
insurance	1
you	1
know	0
so	0

um-hum	0

so	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
i	1
pay	1
them_1	1
and	1
that's	0
it	1
[laughter-you]	1
[laughter-know]	0
that's	1
about	1
the	0
extent	1
of	1
it	0
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
i	0

i	0
don't	1
really	1
have	1
this	0
major	1
budget	1
or	0
anything	1
i	1
just	0
really	0
i'm	1
real	1
thrifty	1
i	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
two	0
children	1
and	0
me	1
and	0
um	1
just	0
real	0
careful	1
with	0
the	1
money	1
you	1
know	0
what	0
little	0
we	0
have	1

um-hum	1

so	1
that's	1
what	0
i	1
do	1

yeah	1
it's	1
a	1
pretty	1
straightforward	1
it's	1
almo[st]	1
i	1
can't	1
imagine	1
having	1
to	1
go	0
into	1
real	1
complicated	1
stuff	1
and	1
making	1
you	0
know	1
fancy	1
budgets	1
it	0

no	1

it	0
seems	1
like	1
if	0
you're	1
getting	1
to	0
that	1
level	0
y[ou're]	1
you're	1
not	1
in	1
real	0
good	1
control	1

huh-uh	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
i	0
i've	1
never	1
liked	1
credit	0
cards	0
and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
debt	1
you	1
know	1
you	0

uh-huh	0

you	0
buy	1
something	0
on	0
credit	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
you	0
pay	0
twice	0
as	0
much	1
for	0
it	0
when	0
you	0
get	0
done	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	0

so	1

actually	1
i'm	0
i	0
me[an]	0
i	0
like	1
using	0
credit	0
cards	0
for	0
everything	1
but	0
just	0
paying	0
off	0
the	0
bills	1
because	0
that	1
way	0
it's	0
a	0
record	1
of	0
everything	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
worry	1
about	0
keeping	1
[laughter-records]	0
of	0
anything	0
else	1
because	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
at	0
the	0
end	0
of	0
the	0
month	1

i	0
don't	1
have	0
too	1
many	0
wea[knesses]	0
i	0
don't	1
have	1
too	1
many	1
weaknesses	1
but	1

but	1
i	1
found	0
out	0
a	1
credit	1
card	0
was	0
one	1
of	1
them_1	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0

uh	0

it's	0
so	1
much	1
easy	0
easier	1
you	1
know	1
if	0
something's	1
on	1
sale	1
if	1
you're	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
you're	1
a	1
sale	1
person	0
it's	0

it's	0
like	0
oh	1
well	0
that's	0
on	0
sale	1
let's	1
go	0
grab	1
it	0
you	1
know	1
so	1
um	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
money	1
then	0
use	0
the	0
credit	1
card	0
so	1
i	1
got	0
rid	1
of	0
them	0
credit	1
cards	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
that's	0
if	0
that's	0
a	0
weakness	1
that's	0
a	0
good	0
thing	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	1
that	1
was	0
my	0
weakness	0
it	1
wasn't	0
bad	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
didn't	0
have	0
like	0
thousands	1
of	0
dollars	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
like	0
that	1
just	0
i	1
just	0
learned	1
that	0
that	0
wasn't	0
for	0
me	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

sure	1

so	1
but	1
i	1
self	1
employed	1
you	0
know	0
i	1
have	1
my	0
own	1
little	1
cleaning	1
business	1
type	1
thing	1
so	0
um	1
i	0
keep	0

do	0
you	0
find	0
trouble	1
keeping	0
the	0
records	0
for	0
taxes	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
or	0

no	1
it's	0
not	0
hard	1
i	0
just	1
keep	0
it	0
in	0
a	0
notebook	1
and	0
write	1
down	0
what	1
i've	0
made	1
and	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
what	1
it's	0
gonna	0
have	0
to	0
go	1
for	1
that	1
month	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
not	1
that	0
not	0
that	0
hard	1
not	1
at	1
all	1

uh-huh	0

well	0
that's	1
good	0
to	0
know	1

so	1
i	1
always	0
do	1
my	0
own	0
income	1
tax	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	1

i	0
don't	1
understand	0
the	0
idea	0
of	0
paying	1
somebody	0
to	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

huh	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
it's	0
absurd	1
the	0
number	1
of	0
people	0
who	0
had	0
to	0
having	0
to	0
pay	1
somebody	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

rea[d]	0
all	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
read	0
a	0
book	1
i	1
mean	0
read	1
the	0
little	0
book	1
they	0
send	0
you	0
fill	1
in	0
the	0
blanks	1
and	0
go	1

i	0

yeah	1
just	0
the	0
form	1

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
it	0
seems	0
absurd	1
that	0
people	0
will	0
pay	1
you	0
know	1
some	0
bucks	1
just	1
to	0
get	0
someone	1
to	0

yeah	0
and	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
them_1	0

it's	0
dumb	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
had	0
some	0
really	1
complicated	0
stuff	1
but	1
i	1
don't	0
so	1
i	1
don't	0
mess	1
with	0
it	1

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
don't	0
use	0
a	1
calculator	1
either	1
[laughter-you]	1
[laughter-know]	1
i	1

i	0
i	1
don't	0
trust	0
myself	0
with	0
using	0
a	0
calculator	1
or	0
computer	1
to	0
too	1
much	0
stuff	0
like	1
that	0
because	0
i	1
wanna	0
make	1
sure	0
that	1
that	0
i	1
i	1
keep	0
on	0
top	1
of	0
the	0
numbers	0
and	0
understand	1
what's	0
going	0
on	1
i	0

i	1
don't	1
i	1
don't	0
have	1
that	0
mu[ch]	1
that	1
many	1
you	1
know	1
things	1
to	0
add	0
up	1
so	1

i	0
know	0
too	1
many	0
people	0
who	0

i	0

for	0

hm	0

call	0
it	0
more	0
straight	1
stuff	1
than	0

can	0
figure	1
out	0
how	1
we	0
can	0
stop	1
this	1
inertia	1
that's	0
rolling	1
towards	1
whatever	1
it's	0
rolling	1
toward	0

i	0
doubt	1
about	0
that	1
are	0
are	0
is	0
america	1
i	0
mean	1
are	0
we	1
pretty	0
pretty	1
steep	1
compared	0
to	0
most	1
countries	0

actually	1
i	1
don't	0
think	0
we	0
are	1

nah	1
i	0
don't	0
think	0
so	0
either	1

um	0
like	1
like	0
europe	1
um	0
england	1
i	0

recording	1
or	0
s[omething]	0

well	0
i	0
don't	1
remember	1
it	0

it	0
seemed	1
like	0
it	0
did	1
but	0
it	0
might	1
not	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
guess	1
we	1
can	1
start	1
um	1

okay	1

okay	1

no	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
have	0
any	0
kids	1
i	0
um	0
my	0
sister	1

a	0
she	1
just	1
had	1
a	1
baby	1
he's	1
about	1
five	1
months	1
old	1
and	1
she	0
was	0
worrying	1
about	0
going	1
back	1
to	0
work	1
and	0
what	1
she	1
was	0
gonna	0
do	1
with	0
him	0
and	0
the	0
different	1

um-hum	1

do	1
you	1
have	1
kids	1

i	1
have	0
three	1

oh	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
i	0
do	1
yes	1
um	1
i	1
don't	0
work	1
though	1
but	1
i	0
used	1
to	0
work	1
and	1
when	0
i	0
had	0
two	1
children	0

um-hum	0

i	1
work	0
off	1
and	0
on	1
just	0
temporarily	1
and	0
usually	1
find	0
friends	1
to	0
babysit	1
but	1
i	1
don't	1
envy	1
anybody	1
who's	0
in	1
[laughter-that]	0
situation	1
to	0
find	1
day	1
care	1

yeah	1

but	1
does	0
your	0
sister	1
live	0
in	0
a	0
big	1
community	1

um	0
yeah	1
she	0
lives	1
it's	1
a	0
it's	1
a	0
fairly	1
large	0
community	1
she	1
um	0
got	0
real	1
lucky	0
though	0
she	1
had	0
a	0
boss	1
who	1
um	0
moved	1
into	0
a	0
larger	0
office	1

um-hum	0

and	0
she's	1
able	0
to	0
take	0
her	0
baby	0
to	0
work	0
with	1
her	0

oh	1
really	1

and	1
it's	1
a	0
small	1
office	1
that	0
she	0
works	1
in	0

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
it's	0
a	0
it's	0
a	0
legal	1
firm	1
office	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
one	1
lawyer	1

um	0

and	0
so	0
she's	1
the	0
only	1
one	1
really	1
that	0
takes	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
office	1
there's	0
no	1
one	0
else	0
that	0
works	1
there	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	1
they	1
have	0
an	0
extra	0
room	1
and	1
everything	0
for	0
the	1
baby	1
so	0
it	0
works	1
out	0
pretty	0
good	1
for	0
her	1

wow	1

how	0
lucky	1
i	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
around	0
here	1
sometimes	0
have	1
like	0
mothers	1
or	0
grandmothers	1
that	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
their	0
kids	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
but	0
the	0
community	1
i'm	1
in	0
is	0
not	0
a	0
real	0
large	1
one	1
so	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	0
babysit	1
in	0
their	0
home	1
that	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
either	0
know	1
them	0
or	0
know	0
somebody	1
who	0
knows	1
them	0
to	0
get	1
to	0

yeah	1
so	0
it's	0
fairly	1
safe	1

yeah	1
to	1
get	0
references	1
and	0
that	1
so	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
i	0
do[n't]	0
don't	1
feel	0
comfortable	1
about	0
leaving	1
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
big	0
day	1
care	0
center	1
but	0
simply	1
because_1	0
there's	0
so	1
many	0
kids	1
and	1
so	1
many	0

worried	1
that	0
they're	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
get	1
enough	0
attention	1

yeah	1
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
colds	1
and	0
things	1
[laughter-like]	0
[laughter-that]	1
get	1
spread	1
real	0
easy	1
and	1
things	1

yeah	1

but	0
and	0
they're	1
expensive	1
and	0
course	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
different	0
types	1
of	0
day	1
care	0
available	1
too	1
you	1
know	1
where	0
they	0
teach	1
them	1
academic	1
things	0

yes	1

or	1
they	0
just	0
watch	1
them	1
and	0
let	1
them_1	0
play	1
and	0
things	1
like	1
that	1
but	0
take	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
right	0
place	1

yeah	1
and	0
you	0
and	0
you	0
don't	1
always	0
even	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
it's	0
gonna	1
be	1
the	1
right	1
place	1
or	1
not	1

um-hum	0

anything	1
i	0
guess	1
could	0
happen	1

um-hum	0

because	0
after	1
i	0
guess	1
after	1
he	0
you	1
know	1
gets	1
to	0
a	0
certain	1
age	1
she's	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
take	0
him	1
to	0
a	0
day	1
care	0

um-hum	0
when	0
he	0
starts	0
toddling	0
around	1
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

when	0
when	0
he's	0
not	1
when	0
she	0
can't	1
keep	1
control	1
of	0
him	0
and	0
he	0
starts	1
crawling	1
that's	0

um-hum	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
hard	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
kind	0
of	0
stressful	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
nice	1
to	0
have	0
him	0
around	1

um-hum	0

but	1
um	0
seems	1

what	0
if	0

cried	1
at	0
the	0
wrong	1
time	0
or	1
the	0
phone	1
rang	1
or	0
you	1
know	0
at	0
the	0
wrong	1
time	1

yeah	1

too	1

um-hum	0
well	1
when	0

kids	1

do	0
you	0
work	1
now	1

i	1
don't	1
know	0
that's	0

that's	0
something	1
i've	0
considered	1
um	1

um-hum	0

i	1
always	1
kind	0
of	1
think	1
it	1
would	0
be	1
neat	1
to	0
be	1
able	0
to	1
watch	1
them_1	0
and	0
be	1
there	0
for	0
them_1	0
all	1
the	0
time	1

um-hum	0

that	1
what	0
you	0
do	1

um	0
yeah	1
uh	0
actually	1
i	0
teach	1
my	0
kids	1
at	0
home	1
so	0
i'm	1
here	0
all	1
the	0
time	0

don't	0
go	0
to	0
school	1

like	0
um	0

that	1
called	1
it's	0
a	1
correspondence	1
school	1
they	0
do	0
it	0
at	0
home	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

that's	1
interesting	1

so	1

do	0
you	1
have	1
to	0
have	1
any	0
special	0
training	1

not	1
it	0
depends	1
on	0
the	0
state	1
you	0
live	0
actually	1
some	0
laws	1
absolutely	1
prohibit	1
it	0
some	1
states	1
um	0
say	0
that	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
certified	1
teacher	1
in	0
order	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
our	1
state	0
doesn't	1
yet	1
say	1
that	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
a	0
certified	1
teacher	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
college	1
but	0
i	0
you	1
know	0
but	0
my	0
kids	1
are	0
only	0
elementary	1
grades	0
levels	1
right	0
now	1
and	1
so	1

so	0
they	1
haven't	0
been	0
to	0
public	1
schools	0
at	0
all	1

one	1
of	0
them_1	0
was	0
for	0
a	0
couple	1
of	0
years	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
know	0
my	0
oldest	1
he	1
was	0
and	0
then	0
my	0
youngest	0
two	1
have	0
never	0
been	1

hm	0

so	1
anyway	1
but	0
we	1
don't	0

so	1
you've	0
never	0
had	0

well	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
like	1
that	1
topic	1

uh	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
i've	1
got	1
mixed	1
feelings	1
about	1
the	1
topic	1

do	1
you	1
i	1
don't	1

no	1
okay	1

no	1
i'm	1
pretty	1
opinionated	1
about	1
that	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know	1
i	1
agree	1
with	1
it	1
i	1
think	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
a	1
company	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	0
test	1
at	1
any	1
any	1
employee	1
anytime	1
they	1
see	1
fit	1

well	1

i	0
just	1
i	1
just	1
don't	0
think	1
there's	1
a	0
place	1
in	1
our	1
en[vironment]	1
environment	1
you	1
know	1
in	0
the	1
work	1
force	1
for	0
drugs	1
or	0
alcohol	1
either	1

well	1
i	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	0
drugs	0
or	0
alcohol	1
but	0
if	1
you'll	1
remember	0
when	0
the	0
teachers	1
had	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
tcat	1
they	0
were	0
talking	1
about	1
drug	1
testing	1
us	0

right	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
we	1
were	0
laughing	1
that	1
we'd	1
have	0
to	1
go	1
to	1
that	0
examination	1
to	0
prove	1
we	0
could	0
read	0
and	1
write	1
with	0
a	0
specimen	0
of	0
urine	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
we	1
found	0
it	1
belittling	1

you	1
did	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	0
well	1
i	1
can	0
sort	1
of	1
understand	1
that	1
uh	1
but	0
not	1
being	1
a	1
teacher	0
as	1
you	1
are	0
you	1
know	1
i	0
i	0
was	0
not	0
quite	1
as	0
sympathetic	1
as	0
you	1
know	1
as	0
i	0
probably	1
would	1
have	0
been	0
if	0
if	0
kay	1
were	0
a	0
teacher	1
or	0
something	1

that's	1
true	0

but	1
uh	0

but	1
then	0
you	1
know	1
at	0
the	1
same	1
token	1
i'm	1
not	1
against	1
because	0
i	1
look	1
at	1
airline	1
pilots	1
bus	1
drivers	0
you	1
know	1
people	1
that	1
really	1
have	1
other	1
peoples'	0
lives	1
in	0
their	1
hands	1
truck	1
drivers	1

uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

that's	0
right	1

that's	0
right	1

it's	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	1
a	1
huge	1
problem	0
with	0
truck	1
drivers	0
using	1
drugs	0
and	1
alcohol	0

th[at's]	0
that's	0
right	1
and	0

and	0
i	1
think	0
it	0
is	1
a	1
big	0
problem	0
with	0
them	0
using	0
drugs	0
from	0
what	0
you	0
read	1
you	0
know	1

and	1

but	0
uh	0

you	1
know	0
in	0
those	1
areas	0
i	1
really	1
you	1
know	1
do	1
believe	1
that	1
maybe	1
we	1
should	1
clean	1
up	0
our	0
you	1
know	1
house	1

yeah	1
i	1
think	0
so	0
too	1
i	0

i	0
i	0
agree	1
with	0
it	0
uh	0
i	0
know	0
kay's	1
company	0
you	0
know	1
they	1
started	0
it	0
couple	0
of	0
years	1
ago	0
and	1
so	0
many	1
of	0
the	0
people	0
even	0
the	1
professional	1
people	0
were	0
boy	1
they	1
were	0
so	1
against	1
them	0
doing	1
that	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
i	0
thought	0
jeez	1
to	0
me	1
it's	0
quite	1
simple	1
uh	1
you	0
either	1
need	1
a	1
job	1
or	0
you	0
don't	1
the	0
the	0
job	1
is	0
what	0
provides	1
all	1
of	0
your	0
needs	1
and	0
uh	0
if	0
they	1
say	0
hey	1
you	0
can't	0
do	1
this	0
work	1
i'd	0
say	0
hey	1
i	0
agree	1
i	0
don't	1
i	0
won't	0
do	1
that	0
and	0
i	1
think	1
most	1
of	1
them_1	1
have	0
agreed	1
to	0
that	0
now	1
although	0
they	0
didn't	0
like	1
it	0
at	0
first	0

yeah	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
just	1
like	0
anything	1
else	1
a	0
new	1
concept	1
you	1
know	0
as	1
i	1
had	1
said	1
if	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
testing	1
area	0
with	0
my	0
urine	1
specimen	0
i	0
was	0
insulted	1

yeah	1
i[t]	0
it	0
it	1
is	0
i	1
can	1
see	1
where	1
you	1
would	1
think	0
yeah	1
that	1
is	1
belittling	1
you	1
know	1
i'd	1
probably	1
feel	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
if	0
i	1
had	0
to	1
do	0
that	0

but	0
at	0
the	0
same	1
token	1
in	0
education	1
we	0
can't	0
do	0
d[rug]	0
drug	0
random	1
drug	0
testing	1
on	0
kids	1

yeah	1
that's	1
true	1

you	1
know	1
i	1
mean	1
their	1
rights	0
are	1
protected	1

you	1
bet	1
oh	1
gosh	1
they	1
w[ould]	0
they	0
would	0
really	1
raise	0
a	0
stink	1
if	0
that	1
was	0
to	0
happen	1

what	0

well	1
but	0
why	1
if	0
you're	0
going	1
to	1
do	0
teachers	1
or	1
professionals	1
why	1
not	1
do	1
the	1
kids	1
when	0
we	0
see	1
them	0
and	0
they're	0
you	1
know	0
under	1
the	0
influence	1

right	1
yes	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
that	0
i	0
i	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
be	0
opposed	0
to	0
it	0
at	0
all	1
it's	0
just	1
our	0
bleeding	1
heart	0
liberals	1
that	1
would	0
fight	1
it	0
too[th]	0
tooth	0
and	0
nail	1
you	0
know	1

that's	1
true	1

but	0
uh	1
well	1
lynn	1
i've	1
enjoyed	0
talking	1
with	0
you	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	0
long	0
we're	0
suppos[ed]	0
to	0
carry	0
on	0
a	0
conversation	1
do	0
you	1

it's	0
three	1
minutes	0
and	0
the	0
clicker	1
comes	0
in	0
when	0
it's	0
time	1
to	0

oh	0
well	0
we'd	1
better	0
keep	0
talking	1
because_1	0
i've	1
not	0
heard	1
it	0
have	1
we	0

yeah	1

have	0
you	1
heard	0
it	0

no	1

anyway	1
we	0
both	1
a	0
sort	1
of	0
agree	1
on	1
it	0
don't	1
we	0
a[bout]	0
about	0
random	1
testing	0

well	1
do	0
we	0
agree	1
or	0
unless	1
it's	0
it's	0
not	0
me	1

well	0
you	0
see	1

you	1
know	0
here	0
we	0
go	1
again	0
i	1
mean	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

yeah	1
you	1
know	0
i	0

if	0
you	0
agree	1
yeah	1

i	0
believe	1
that	0
truck	1
drivers	0
and	0
people	1
that	0
have	0
even	0
though	1
teachers	1
have	1
other	0
kids	0
lives	0
in	0
their	0
hands	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
stoned	1
or	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
drunk	1

yeah	1

and	0
there	1
was	0
an	0
incident	1
in	0
my	0
children's	0
high	1
school	0
where	0
a	0
teacher	1
stayed	1
drunk	0

is	1
that	0
right	1

uh-huh	0

you	0
just	1
don't	0
think	1
of	0
that	0
happening	1
with	0
teachers	1

and	1
yet	1

i	0
really	1
don't	1
i	0
when	0
i	1
think	0
of	0
drug	1
testing	0
i'm	1
thinking	0
of	0
the	0
uh	0
you	0
kn[ow]	0
outside	1
of	0
education	0

uh	0
well	1
no	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
we	0
are	1
as	1
susceptible	1
a	0
society	1
as	0
anybody	0
else	1

sure	1
sure	1

i	0
know	1
that	0
but	0
uh	0
you	0
don't	0
think	1
of	0
that	0
first	0
hand	1
normally	1

and	0
uh	1

yeah	1
well	1
did	0
you	1
hear	1
on	0
the	0
news	1
where	1
the	1
teacher	1
of	0
the	0
year	1
was	0
up	1
for	0
child	1
molestation	1

isn't	1
that	0
isn't	1
that	0
mind	1
boggling	1

it	0
was	0
on	0
the	0
news	1
tonight	1

goodness	1
it	0
it	0
is	1
it's	0
mind	1
bogg[ling]	0
and	0
well	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
agree	0
with	0
you	0
i	1
know	0
teachers	1
are	0
just	0
like	0
everybody	0
else	1
same	1
problems	1
the	0
same	0
uh	0
good	0
qualities	1
as	0
anybody	0
else	1

yeah	1

then	1
i	1
think	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
it	0
came	1
push	1
came	0
to	0
shove	0
i'd	0
probably	1
be	0
drug	1
tested	1
you	1
know	0
because_1	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

because_1	0
it	0
does	1
you	1
know	0

y[ou]	0
you	0
think	1
the	0
benefit	1
would	0
be	0
greater	1
than	0
the	0

yeah	1
because_1	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
i	0
say	1
i'm	0
sitting	1
there	0
fussing	0
and	0
fussing	1
and	0
yet	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
you	1
know	0
one	1
teacher	0
who	0
was	1
an	1
alcoholic	1
in	1
school	1
as	0
well	0
as	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
presume	1
out	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
that	1
was	0
in	0
your	1
children's	0
high	1
school	0

um-hum	0

isn't	0
that	0
amazing	1

and	0
you	1
know	0
my	1
children	1
brought	0
it	0
to	0
my	1
attention	0
i	0
never	0
was	0
there	1
to	0
see	1
it	0

if	0
it	0
if	0
it's	0
if	0
it	0
was	0
true	1
there	1
i'm	0
sure	1
it's	0
true	0
with	0
just	0
about	0
probably	1
to	0
some	1
degree	0
every	0
school	1
there	0
is	1

um-hum	1

you	1
know	0
because	0
they	0
represent	1
a	0
pretty	1
good	0

and	0
that's	1
not	0
giving	0
a	0
good	0
example	1
to	0
students	1

no	1
certainly	0
not	1
uh	0
certainly	0
not	1
they	0
don't	0
need	1
that	0
example	0
but	0

is	1
uh	1
kind	1
of	1
fun	1
it's	1
best	1
done	1
when	1
you	0
have	1
leisure	1
time	1
and	1
i	0
had	1
more	0
of	1
that	0
in	0
my	0
childhood	1
days	1
than	0
i	0
have	1
now	1
and	1
i	1
grew	1
up	1
in	1
an	1
area	1
that	1
uh	1
it	1
was	1
just	0
a	0
few	1
feet	1
from	0
a	0
rather	1
large	1
lake	1
and	0
a	0
few	1
more	0
miles	1
from	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
even	0
larger	1
lake	0
and	0
we	0
had	1
a	0
variety	1
of	0
boats	1
at	1
our	0
disposal	1
um	0
i	0
worked	1
for	1
a	1
camp	1
for	0
a	0
number	1
of	0
years	1
my	0
father	1
was	0
on	0
staff	1
there	1
and	0
we	0
had	0
every	0
kind	1
of	0
things	1
from	0
canoes	1
to	0
paddle	1
boats	0
sailboats	1
um	0
speedboats	1
uh	0
you	0
name	1
it	0
they	0
had	1
it	0
and	0
we	0
did	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
watering	1
water	1
sports	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
the	0
thing	1
i	0
liked	1
the	0
best	1
was	0
uh	0
we	0
spent	1
about	0
a	0
summer	1
couple	1
of	0
guys	1
uh	0
restored	0
an	0
old	1
wooden	1
boat	1
that	0
was	0
built	1
back	1
in	0
the	0
mid	0
thirties	1
and	0
got	1
a	0
new	1
canvas	1
sail	1
for	0
it	0
and	0
had	0
a	0
real	1
hu[ge]	0
big	1
old	0
four	1
foot	0
center	1
board	0
that	0
went	0
down	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
to	0
keep	0
you	0
upright	1
when	0
the	0
waves	1
or	0
the	0
wind	1
came	0
from	0
the	0
side	1
and	0
we	0
got	0
that	0
thing	1
in	0
the	0
water	1
and	0
had	1
a	0
real	0
good	0
time	1
with	0
it	0
if	0
you	1
ever	0
got	1
it	0
dumped	1
over	0
though	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
mess	1
to	0
get	0
back	0
up	1
it	0
wasn't	0
like	1
the	0
newer	0
ones	0
that	0
have	0
nice	1
chambers	1
that	0
keep	1
it	0
afloat	1
or	0
keep	0
it	0
uh	0
upright	1
again	1
this	0
one	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
work	1
with	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-get]	0
[laughter-out]	0
[laughter-of]	0
the	0
water	1
again	0
and	0
get	0
it	0
upright	1
and	0
uh	0
sailing	1
was	0
was	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
to	0
learn	1
the	0
maneuvers	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
make	1
to	0
work	1
your	0
way	0
down	0
a	0
lake	1
or	0
work	0
back	1
up	0
against	0
the	0
the	0
wind	1
as	0
it	0
were	0
attacking	1
back	0
and	0
forth	1
and	0
um	0
more	1
than	0
once	1
we'd	0
get	0
out	0
there	1
on	0
a	0
really	0
stormy	1
day	1
and	0
uh	0
the	0
storm	1
or	0
the	0
wind	1
was	0
due	1
to	0
the	0
s[torm]	0
front	1
blowing	0
in	1
and	0
soon	1
as	0
the	0
front	1
came	0
over	1
it	0
was	0
calm	1
so	0
you're	0
out	1
in	0
the	0
middle	0
of	0
nowhere	1
with	0
a	0
paddle	1
[laughter-and]	0
[laughter-you]	0
paddle	1
your	0
way	0
back	0
in	1
and	0
hope	1
it	0
doesn't	0
start	1
raining	1
on	0
you	0
right	0
away	1
and	0
that	0
didn't	0
always	0
work	1
we	0
often	1
times	1
got	0
wet	1
but	1
um	0
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
nice	1
nice	0
hobby	1
to	0
have	1
and	0
nowadays	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
could	0
afford	1
the	0
boat	1
or	0
the	0
time	1
nor	0
do	0
we	0
live	0
that	1
close	0
to	0
a	0
lake	1
anymore	0
so	0
things	0
change	1
i	0
guess	1
what	0
are	0
your	1
memories	1
of	0
boating	1
or	0
current	1

um	1
about	1
the	1
only	1
memories	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
of	1
boating	1
um	1
my	1
husband's	1
family	1
had	1
a	1
a	1
motor	1
boat	1
um	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
engaged	1
and	0
they	1
took	1
us	1
out	0
on	1
the	0
lake	1
several	0
times	1
and	1
uh	1
i	1
really	1
did	1
enjoy	1
that	1
i	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
ever	0
learned	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
or	1
anything	1
but	0
um	1
we	1
did	0
some	0
water	1
skiing	0
of	0
course	1
and	1
and	1
uh	1
driving	1
around	1
the	1
lake	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
and	0
just	1
the	1
basic	1
safety	1
rules	1
and	1
things	1
i	1
found	1
real	1
interesting	1
um	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
you	0
they	0
just	1
didn't	0
patrol	1
you	0
like	1
they	0
did	1
with	0
the	0
automobile	1
or	0
whatever	0
the	0
the	0
laws	1
were	0
there	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
didn't	1
obey	1
them_1	0
uh	1
you	0
know	1
[laughter-there]	0
were	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
accidents	1
i	0
guess	0

right	1

it's	0
true	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
found	0
the	0
motor	1
boating	1
was	1
real	0
fun	1

yeah	1
i	1
remember	0
learning	1
how	1
to	0
ski	1
oh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
was	0
seven	1
or	0
eight	1
years	0
old	1
and	0
the	0
lake	1
that	0
we	0
learned	1
on	0
was	0
the	0
smaller	1
of	0
the	0
two	1
that	0
we	0
had	0
access	1
to	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
maybe	0
fifteen	1
twenty	0
acres	1
and	1
it	0
was	0
uh	0
it	0
had	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
um	0
turtles	1
in	0
it	0
and	0
i	1
got	0
all	1
ready	1
to	0
go	0
and	0
i	1
was	0
down	1
in	0
the	1
water	1
and	0
and	0
set	1
to	0
go	1
and	1
a	0
and	1
just	1
as	0
that	1
boat	1
took	1
off	1
a	0
turtle	1
bit	1
me	0
in	0
the	0
middle	0
of	0
the	0
back	1
it	0

oh	0

it	0
didn't	0
hurt	0
too	0
much	1
but	0
it	0
bit	0
enough	1
to	0
where	1
i	0
let	0
go	1
and	0
the	0
boat	1
went	0
off	0
without	1
me	0
and	0
i	0
reached	0
back	1
there	0
and	0
sn[atched]	0
pushed	1
him	0
away	1
and	0
got	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
water	1
a	0
a	0
while	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
it	0
didn't	1
even	0
leave	0
a	0
mark	1
it	0
was	0
just	0
a	0
little	0
nibble	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
told	1
everybody	0
what	0
happened	1
and	0
they	0
go	0
oh	0
yeah	1
sure	1
you	0
know	0
and	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
get	1
back	0
down	0
in	0
there	1
and	0
and	0
i'll	1
be	1
if	0
he	1
didn't	0
do	0
it	0
again	1
this	0
time	1
a	0
little	0
earlier	1
and	0
and	0
i	1
had	0
let	0
go	0
before	1
then	0
and	0
before	1
they	0
took	0
off	1
this	0
time	1
and	0
and	0
swatted	1
him	0
away	1
so	0
i	0
moved	0
over	1
a	0
a	0
few	0
feet	1
in	0
the	0
water	1
and	0
got	1
out	0
of	0
his	1
little	0
realm	1
where	0
he	0
was	0
living	1
underneath	0
the	0
dock	1
and	0
uh	0
managed	1
to	0
get	0
up	1
didn't	0
go	1
very	0
far	1
but	0
i	0
got	0
up	1
and	0
it	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
nice	1
uh	0
nice	0
long	1
skiing	1
career	1
but	0
now	1
i've	0
gotten	0
to	0
where	0
skiing	1
is	0
just	0
kind	0
of	0
wears	1
me	0
out	1
more	0
than	0
it	0
does	1
thrill	1
me	0
i've	0
i've	0
uh	0
done	1
about	0
all	0
i	0
dare	1
do	0
on	0
skis	1
you	0
know	0
skiing	1
on	0
one	1
and	0
jumping	1
around	0
here	1
and	0
there	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
i	0
know	1
how	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
injured	1
doing	0
much	0
more	1
than	0
that	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
can't	1
risk	1
it	0
right	0
now	1
being	0
a	0
head	1
of	0
the	0
family	1
and	0
the	0
breadwinner	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
just	0
uh	0
can't	0
take	0
the	0
risk	1
i	0
did	1
as	0
a	0
dumb	0
teenager	1
i	0
guess	1
so	0
life	1
changes	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
in	0
that	1
respect	1
i'd	0
kind	0
of	0
like	1
someday	1
to	0
maybe	1
end	0
up	0
on	0
a	0
pair	1
of	0
skis	1
that	0
that	0
doesn't	0
have	1
a	0
uh	0
well	0
what	0
they	0
call	1
trick	1
skis	0
they'll	0
allow	1
you	0
to	0
ski	0
backwards	1
i	0
haven't	0
cra[ft]	0
managed	1
to	0
get	0
a	1
hold	1
on	0
that	1
uh	0
craft	1
yet	1
but	0
uh	0

that	0
sounds	1
like	0
a	0
real	1
challenge	1

yeah	0
it	0
it'd	0
be	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
i	0
hadn't	0
quite	0
figured	0
out	1
i	0
don't	0
have	1
anybody	0
to	0
teach	1
me	1
either	0
that's	0
another	1
little	0
thing	1
you	0
need	1
somebody	0
to	0
kind	1
of	0
tell	0
you	0
what	1
to	0
do	1
but	0
just	1
from	0
what	0
i've	0
seen	1
you	0
just	0
kind	0
of	0
w[ork]	0
work	1
your	0
way	0
up	1
to	0
it	1
and	0
turn	0
around	1
real	0
quick	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0
grab	1
the	0
rope	1
behind	1
you	0
and	0
then	0
just	0
l[et]	0
let	0
go	1
real	0
quick	1
and	0
let	0
it	0
whip	1
you	0
around	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
maybe	0
someday	1
i'll	1
i'll	0
get	0
back	1
to	0
that	1
as	0
after	0
the	0
kids	1
are	0
up	0
and	0
grown	1
and	0
the	0
monies	1
are	0
there	1
to	0
get	0
away	1
for	0
times	1
on	0
end	1
uh	0
weekend	1
or	0
something	1

well	0
my	1
son	1

okay	1
uh	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
crime	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
i'm	1
sure	1
i[t]	1
like	1
in	1
yours	0
it's	1
pretty	1
pretty	1
bad	1
uh	0
probably	1
the	1
biggest	1
thing	0
we've	1
got	0
going	0
now	1
is	0
the	0
robberies	1
and	0
theft	1
and	0
probably	1
murder	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
top	1
ones	1
that	0
we	1
have	1
how	0

um-hum	1

how	0
about_1	1
you	1

uh	0
well	1
i	1
don't	1
actually	0
live	1
in	0
the	0
city	1
but	1
uh	1
i'd	1
probably	1
say	1
that's	1
roughly	0
right	1
i	0
mean	1
crimes	1
against	0
property	1
seem	1
to	0
outnumber	1
crimes	0
against	1
life	1
but	1
i	1
i	0
think	1
with	0
the	1
current	1
war	0
on	0
drugs	1
and	0
all	0
this	1
kind	1
of	0
stuff	1
i'd	1
say	0
probably	1
the	1
police	1
department	0
would	0
claim	1
the	0
number	0
one	1
crimes	1
crimes	1
are	0
probably	0
solicitation	1
of	0
prostitution	1
um	0
and	1
sale	1
of	0
drugs	1

um-hum	1
proba[bly]	1
probably	1
right	1
if	0
you	1
look	1
at	0
it	1
from	1
that	1
stand	1
point	1

um-hum	1

what	0
uh	1
is	1
there	1
anything	0
that	0
uh	1
that	1
you	1
particularly	0
are	1
concerned	1
with	1
in	0
in	1
your	1
particular	1
area	1
as	0
far	0
as	1
security	1
and	0
that	1
sort	0
of	1
thing	0

uh	1
where	1
i	1
live	1
no	1
it's	1
it's	1
not	1
so	1
bad	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
can	1
basically	1
leave	1
my	1
front	1
door	1
unlocked	1
and	1
not	0
have	0
to	1
worry	1
about	0
it	1
um	0
but	0
i	0
do	1
have	0
friends	1
who	0
live	0
in	0
the	0
city	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
they	0
get	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
fallout	1
from	1
this	1
war	1
on	0
drug	1
thing	1
um	0
just	1
because	0
there	1
are	1
like	0
crack	1
houses	1
you	1
know	1
on	1
their	1
street	1
and	1
stuff	1
like	0
this	1

um-hum	0
do	0
you	0
live	1
in	0
a	0
real	1
small	0
town	1
or	0
or	1
out	0
in	1
the	0
country	1

i	1
live	1
out	0
in	1
the	0
country	1
yeah	1

how	0
far	0
out	0
from	1
the	1
city	0
i	0
mean	0
do	1
you	0

i	0
am	1
about	1
fifteen	1
miles	0
out	1

about_1	1
fifteen	0
miles	0
i	0
live	1
in	0
a	1
little	0
suburb	1
uh	1
which	1
is	1
i	1
guess	1
from	1
dallas	1
is	0
twelve	1
miles	1
or	0
so	1

um-hum	1

but	1
it's	1
pretty	0
congested	1
we	1
are	1
considered	1
in	0
the	0
country	0
but	1

hm	0

but	1
it	1
doesn't	0
really	0
feel	1
like	0
you're	0
in	0
the	0
country	1

hm	0

our	1
major	0
crimes	1
in	1
our	1
immediate	1
town	1
uh	0
is	0
probably	1
robberies	0
house	1
robberies	0
and	0
very	0
few	1
instances	1
of	0
you	0
know	1
alcohol	1
drug	0
uh	1
reported	1

um-hum	0

however	1
i'm	1
sure	1
they're	1
there	1

um-hum	1

but	0
uh	1
right	1
now	1
our	0
neighborhood	1
is	1
running	0
about	1
uh	1
eighty	1
percent	0
of	1
the	0
homeowners	1
have	1
been	0
robbed	1
sometime	1
during	0
their	1
their	1
uh	1
existence	1
in	1
that	0
neighborhood	1

wow	0

that's	0
huge	0

and	1
since	1
that	1
time	1
everybody's	1
gotten	1
some	0
sort	1
of	0
burglar	1
system	0
or	0
you	1
know	0
uh	0
burglar	1
alarms	0
uh	1
and	1
including	1
the	0
out	1
uh	1
the	1
outer	1
perimeter	1
type	1
uh	1
devices	1
the	1
sensors	1
and	1
things	1
like	0
that	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	1

it's	1
cut	1
back	1
you	0
know	1
considerably	1
but	0
it	0
it	1
just	1
shifts	1
it	1
from	1
our	1
neighborhood	1
to	1
another	1
neighborhood	1
to	1
another	1
neighborhood	1
so	1
it	1
still	1
uh	0
remains	1
city	1
wide	0
pretty	1
pretty	1
high	1

are	0
they	1
are	0
there	0
any	0
theories	1
on	0
why	1
this	0
is	0
happening	1

uh	0
i	0
would	1
say	0
the	0
majority	1
of	0
it's	0
happening	0
during	1
the	0
day	1
uh	0
between	1
probably	1
ten	1
in	0
the	0
morning	1
and	1
three	1
in	1
the	0
afternoon	1

um-hum	0

most	1

but	0
why	0
why	0
is	0
it	0
happening	0

well	0
most	1
families	1
most	0
families	0
they	0
are	1
young	1
and	0
both	0
people	0
are	1
working	1

um-hum	0

so	0
they're	1
happening	1
during	1
the	0
hours	1
they're	0
gone	1
from	0
work	1

um-hum	1

uh	1
so	1
uh	0
i	0
would	1
say	0
that's	1
probably	0
their	1
prime	1
motivation	1
they'll	1
s[talk]	0
they'll	0
stalk	1
your	1
house	1
and	0
uh	0
look	1
at	0
your	1
pattern	1
and	1
then	1
go	1
from	0
there	1

so	0
they're	0
professionals	0

um	0
they	1
classify	1
most	0
of	1
them_1	1
as	1
professionals	1

hm	0

uh	0
you	0
get	0
a	1
few	1
of	1
them_1	0
that	0
are	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
sloppier	1
uh	0
just	1
taking	1
uh	0
you	1
know	1
just	0
junk	1
items	1
that	0
they	1
they	0
can	0
just	0
get	1
you	0
know	1
ten	1
to	0
twenty	1
bucks	0
for	0
real	1
quick	1

um-hum	0

probably	1
the	0
biggest	1
items	1
that	1
uh	0
that	0
you	1
get	1
in	0
our	0
neighborhood	1
or	0
would	1
be	1
the	1
high	1
classed	1
automobiles	1
mercedes	1
volvos	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
can	0
get	1
you	0
know	1
big	1
dollars	0
for	1
uh	0
jewelry	1
are	1
the	0
major	1
targets	1
guns	0

um-hum	0

guns	0
that	1
sort	1
of	1
stuff	1

hm	0

very	1
few	1
you	1
know	0
penny	0
penny	0
ante	1
stuff	0

well	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
think	1
can	0
be	0
done	1
to	0
reduce	1
that	0
sort	0
of	0
crime	1

well	0
uh	0
the	0
police	1
force	0
for	0
one	0
i	0
think	0
they	0
could	1
uh	0
definitely	1
add	1
to	0
the	0
police	0
force	1
and	0
the	0
type	0
equipment	1
that	0
they	0
use	1
uh	0
it's	0
oh	0
right	1
now	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
we're	1
about	1
thirty	1
thousand	0
people	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
eight	1
officers	0
that	0
patrol	1
for	0
thirty	1
for	0
that	1
amount	0
of	0
people	1
which	0
is	1
not	0
very	0
many	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

right	0

and	0

but	0
that	0
mean	0
that's	0
gonna	0
tend	1
to	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
me	1
that	0
sort	0
of	0
approach	1
will	0
tend	1
to	0
simply	0
make	1
the	0
cost	1
of	0
committing	0
the	0
crime	0
slightly	1
higher	1
in	1
other	0
words	1
you've	0
increased	0
the	0
probability	1
of	0
somebody	0
being	0
caught	1
a	0
little	0
bit	1
the	0
real	1
question	1
is	0
how	0
do	0
you	1
convince	0
people	0
not	1
to	0
commit	0
such	0
crimes	1
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	1

well	0
the	0
course	0
in	0
our	1
particular	0
state	1
uh	0
we	0
have	0
the	0
prison	1
overcrowding	0
whatever	1
so	0
they're	0
giving	0
the	0
early	1
release	1
uh	0

right	0
they're	0
doing	1
that	1
in	0
our	0
state	1
t[oo]	0

yeah	0
and	0
and	0
it's	0
i	0
think	1
what	0
they	0
need	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
stop	0
building	1
more	0
jails	1
and	0
start	0
giving	1
stiffer	0
sentences	1
uh	0
but	0
for	1
the	0

so	0
you	1
think	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
deterrent	1

that	0
would	0
be	1
certainly	0
be	0
a	0
deterrent	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
not	0
necessarily	0
you	1
know	0
uh	0
give	0
in	0
to	0
their	0
uh	0
human	0
rights	0
desires	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
they're	0
overcrowded	0
just	0
keep	0
cramming	0
them_1	0
in	0
there	0
till	0
they	0
just	0
suffocate	0
uh	0

well	0
what	0
about	0
an	0
innocent	0
person	0
who	0
happens	0
to	0
have	0
been	0
found	0
guilty	0

uh	0
i	0
think	1
they'd	0
have	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
extra	1
measures	1
to	0
make	0
sure	1
a	0
person's	0
guilty	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
cases	1
course	0
i	0
i	0
know	0
you	0
can't	0
be	0
a	0
hundred	0
percent	0
foolproof	0

right	0

uh	0

so	0
you'd	1
you'd	1
rather	0
see	1
it	0
harder	1
to	0
convict	0
somebody	1

i'd	0
rather	1
see	1
it	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
harder	1
and	0
have	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
more	0
evidence	1
uh	0
to	0
convict	1
somebody	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
then	0
those	0
convicted	0
especially	0
of	0
you	0
know	0
murder	0
and	0
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
major	0
crimes	0
uh	0
to	0
reach	0
the	0
life	0
sentences	0
and	0
you	0
know	0
death	0
penalties	0
and	0
follow-through	0
with	0
that	0

um-hum	0

hm	0

uh	0
especially	1
you	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	1
case	0
of	1
murder	1

right	0

uh	0
i	0
know	1
in	0
my	1
case	0
i	1
ha[d]	0
my	0
wife	1
and	0
daughter	0
were	0
kidnapped	1
during	0
a	0
house	1
robbery	1
back	1
in	0
eighty	0
five	1

oh	0
wow	0

oh	0
my	0
goodness	0

and	1
we	0
caught	1
the	0
individuals	1
got	0
caught	1
we	0
uh	0
we	0
went	1
through	0
the	0
court	1
system	1
and	0
all	0
that	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
two	1
counts	0
of	0
kidnapping	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
forty	1
five	0
to	0
the	0
head	1
you	0
know	0
just	1
the	1
the	0
mental	0
anguish	1
and	0
the	0
whole	0
nine	0
yards	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
guy	1
only	0
got	0
five	0
years	1

um-hum	0

right	0

wow	0

and	1
you	0
know	0
he	1
was	0
out	0
within	1
two	0
months	1
because	0
of	0
the	0
parole	1
system	0
so	0
what	0
what	0

did	0
you	1
did	0
you	0
sue	1
him	0
under	1
the	0
civil	0
system	1

do	0
what	0
now	0

did	0
you	0
sue	1
him	0
under	0
the	0
civil	1
system	1

n[o]	0
no	0
i'm	0
not	0
real	0
familiar	0
with	0
that	0

well	0
you	1
probably	1
sue	0
him	0
for	0
mental	1
anguish	1
or	0
something	1
right	1
and	0
try	1
to	0
get	0
money	0
from	0
him	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0

well	1
the	0
insurance	1
companies	0
and	0
all	0
that	1
tried	1
to	0
tried	1
to	0
go	0
after	1
him	0
and	0
they	0
said	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
he	1
they're	1
he	0
has	0
no	0
job	1
he	0
has	0
nothing	0
there's	0
nothing	1
that	0
he	0
has	1
that	0
that	0
you	0
could	0
go	0
after	1

yeah	0
makes	1
you	0
wish	1
they	0
had	1
uh	0
still	0
had	0
indentured	1
servitude	1
for	0
this	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	1

yeah	0
uh	0
very	0
seldom	0

but	0
they	1
g[ive]	0
give	1
the	0
guy	0
a	0
job	1
in	0
prison	1
and	0
make	1
him	0
pay	0
his	0
damn	1
debt	1

yeah	0
they	0
don't	1
do	0
that	0
here	1
course	0
they	0
pay	0
them	0
but	0
they	0
don't	0
you	0
don't	0
you	1
or	0
the	0
insurance	1
companies	0
never	1
see	0
any	0
of	0
that	0
money	1

yeah	0
that's	0
too	0
bad	0

and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
and	0
they're	1
right	0
now	0
they're	0
reluctant	1
to	0
go	0
after	0
them_1	0
because	0
they're	1
you	0
know	1
they're	1
they're	0
repeat	1
offenders	1
they	1
uh	0
they've	0
been	1
in	0
jail	0
before	1
they've	0

um-hum	0
um-hum	0

they've	0
been	0
released	1
you	1
know	0
several	0
times	1
which	0
is	0
another	1
uh	0
deal	1
i	0
hate	0
to	0
see	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	1
you	0
know	1
basically	1
the	0
guy	0
commits	1
you	0
know	1
three	1
major	0
crimes	1
and	0
uh	0
and	0
car	1
theft	0
on	0
top	0
of	0
it	1
and	0
destroys	1
my	0
car	1
he	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
a	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

he	0
we're	0
out	1
you	0
know	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
fifteen	1
thousand	0
dollars	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
guy	1
gets	0
out	0
in	0
two	0
months	1
and	0

that's	0
awful	0

and	0
he	0
goes	0
out	0
and	0
commits	1
it	0
again	1
fact	0
he's	0
back	1
in	0
[laughter-jail]	1
now	0
so	0
what	0
what	0
uh	0

gives	1
you	0
sympathy	1
for	0
the	0
vigilantes	1

yeah	0
what	1
what	0
deterrent	1
does	0
he	0
really	0
have	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
in	0
our	1
in	0
our	1
particular	0
neighborhood	1
vigilantism	1
is	0
becoming	1
a	0
real	1
real	0
possibility	1

um-hum	0

uh	0
we've	0
had	0
a	0
couple	1
instances	0
where	0
break-ins	1
where	0
the	1
the	0
people	0
have	1
actually	1
you	0
know	1
shot	1
the	0
people	1

oh	0
my	0
god	0

and	0
uh	0
return	0
offenders	0
have	0
they've	0
actually	1
waited	1
for	0
them_1	0
where	0
they've	0
robbed	1
you	0
know	1
particular	0
neighborhood	1
they'll	0
rob	1
one	0
house	1
then	1
other	0
people	1
will	0
wait	0
up	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
wait	1
for	0
somebody	0
to	0
do	0
something	0
else	1
and	0
try	0
to	0
take	1
it	0
in	0
their	0
own	0
hands	1
course	0

right	0

course	0
it	0
doesn't	0
always	0
work	1
out	0
in	0
their	0
favor	1

right	0

but	0
uh	0
nevertheless	1
i	0
think	0
people	1
are	0
just	0
getting	0
fed	0
up	1
and	0
saying	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
can't	1
arrest	0
all	1
of	0
us	0
you	1

um-hum	0

you	1
can	0
you	0
know	1
you	1
can	0
get	0
some	1
of	0
us	0
you	0

i	0
mean	0

you	0
can't	1
get	0
all	1
of	0
us	0

mean	0
that	0

uh	0
and	0
we're	1
beginning	0
to	0
see	1
more	1
and	0
more	0
of	0
that	1

that	0
sounds	1
that's	0
a	0
deterrent	1
too	1
if	0
you	0
think	1
the	0
home	1
owner	0
might	0
be	0
armed	1
right	1
and	0
awake	1

yeah	0

hear	0
you	0
break	0
in	0
and	0
you're	0
gonna	1
get	0
shot	1

yeah	0
that's	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	0
certainly	1
a	0
a	0
possibility	1
an[d]	0
an[d]	0
we	0
have	1
had	0
a	0
a	0
few	1
cases	1
where	0
the	0
guy	1
has	0
broken	0
in	1
you	0
know	1
during	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
the	0
night	1
and	0
gotten	1
himself	0
shot	0
to	0
death	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
it	0
helps	1
for	0
a	0
while	1

um-hum	0

but	0
then	0
just	0
another	0
different	1
set	0
of	0
people	1
come	0
in	1
and	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
people	0
are	0
transients	1
from	0
out	1
outside	1
of	0
the	0
state	1

hm	0

uh	0
i	0
would	0
say	0
probably	0
eighty	1
percent	0
of	0
them_1	0
that	0
are	0
caught	1
they're	1
from	0
places	1
like	0
up	0
in	0
oklahoma	1
and	1
louisiana	1
arkansas	1
you	0
know	0
across	1
the	0
the	0
border	1

wow	0

so	0
you	0
know	0
people	0
who	0
don't	1
readily	0
read	0
the	0
newspapers	1
in	0
our	0
town	1
or	0
whatever	1

um-hum	0

it's	0
not	0
many	0
from	0
the	0
local	1
communities	1

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
it's	0
a	0
problem	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
the	0
court	1
systems	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
more	0
accurate	1
in	0
in	0
stiffer	1
in	0
their	0
penalties	1

yeah	0

would	0
be	0
a	0
definite	1
deterrent	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
giving	1
the	0
uh	0
police	1
uh	0
agencies	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
jurisdiction	0
over	0
what	1
they	0
do	1
when	0
they	1
when	0
they	0
catch	1
these	0
people	1

yeah	0

um-hum	0
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	1
tend	0
to	0
agree	1
with	0
you	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
what	0
i	1
would	0
like	1
to	0
see	0
is	0
number	0
one	1
completely	1
getting	0
rid	1
of	0
these	0
victimless	1
crimes	1
um	0
there's	0
no	0
reason	1
to	0
enforce	1
those	0
and	0
spend	0
time	1
and	0
money	0
doing	1
it	0
and	1
and	0
worry	1
about	0
these	0
things	0
where	0
people	1
are	0
getting	0
hurt	1

right	0

and	1
i	0
think	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
big	0
things	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
is	0
to	0
increase	0
deterrence	1
is	1
um	0
if	0
someone	1
is	0
found	0
guilty	1
of	0
a	1
uh	0
felony	1
level	0
offense	1
they	0
lose	1
their	0
citizenship	1
and	0
they	0
lose	1
their	0
constitutional	0
rights	1

um-hum	0

you	1
know	0
and	0
just	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
things	1
that	0
we're	0
trying	0
to	0
worry	1
about	1
you	0
know	1
protecting	0
these	0
people	1
from	0
we	1
just	0
don't	0
protect	1
them_1	0

i	0
know	1
like	0
in	0
my	0
wife's	1
case	0
they	0
made	1
her	0
feel	0
like	0
the	0
criminal	1

i	0
know	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
ridicul[ous]	0

they	1
they	0
went	0
to	0
all	1
all	1

seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
a	1
topic	1
that's	1
gonna	1
probably	1
take	1
about	1
a	1
generation	1
to	0
uh	1
catch	1
on	1
it	0
seems	0
or	1
maybe	1
a	1
generation	0
to	0
two	1
and	1
we	0
may	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
necessity	1
as	1
far	1
as	0
moving	1
that	1
time	1
schedule	0
up	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
seem	0
to	0
be	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
habits	1
to	0
break	0
i	0
um	0
wasn't	0
raised	1
as	0
a	0
kid	1
on	1
it	0
but	1
my	1
kids	1
are	1
and	0
so	0
they	1
they	1
tended	1
to	1
wanna	1
grab	1
the	0
aluminum	0
cans	1
when	0
that	1
was	1
one	0
of	1
the	0
first	1
things	0
to	0
do	1
and	0
we	1
were	1
doing	0
all	1
right	1
there	1
until	0
uh	1
the	0
price	1
dropped	1
out	0
and	0
they	1
weren't	0
worth	1
anything	1
anymore	1

um-hum	1

and	1
we	1
it	1
took	0
us	0
um	0
almost	1
a	1
year	1
to	0
get	0
a	0
garbage	1
sack	1
full	1
we	0
just	0
don't	0
drink	1
that	0
many	0
so	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
at	0
home	1
use	0
uh	0
we'll	0
pick	0
up	0
a	0
six	1
pack	0
every	0
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	0
or	0
for	1
whatever	0
occasion	1
of	0
dr	0
pepper	1
or	0
something	0
and	0
and	0
by	0
the	0
time	0
we	0
gathered	1
up	0
enough	1
crushed	1
cans	1
to	0
take	0
it	0
in	1
uh	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
it	0
was	0
still	0
oh	0
about	0
forty	1
or	0
fifty	0
cents	1
a	0
pound	1
and	0
we	0
came	1
out	0
with	0
about_1	0
a	1
dollar	1
[laughter-it]	0
just	0
really	1
wasn't	0
worth	1
it	0

and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
hassle	1
all	1
year	0
round	1
and	1
cans	1
laying	1

yeah	1
so	0

yeah	1

so	0
they	1
they	0
realized	0
you	0
know	0
well	1
of	1
course	1
to	0
them	1
a	0
dollar	1
was	0
a	0
dollar	1
at	0
four	1
and	0
five	1
years	0
old	1
that	0
wasn't	1
uh	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
big	1
deal	1
but	0
we	0
decided	1
it	1
wasn't	0
worth	0
us	1
keeping	0
it	0
and	0
then	0
um	0
ti	1
started	0
keeping	1
up	1
with	0
uh	1
cans	0
there	1
so	0
occasionally	1
i'll	0
bring	1
whatever	0
i've	0
got	1
laying	0
around	0
the	1
car	0
or	1
the	0
like	1
and	1
throw	0
them_1	0
in	0
there	1
least	0
it	1
gets	0
back	1
into	1
the	0
system	1
but	0
um	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
a	0
habit	1
at	0
the	0
house	0
uh	0
i	0
haven't	0
started	1
on	0
anything	0
other	1
than	1
just	0
whatever	1
the	0
city	1
wants	0
to	0
pick	1
up	0
have	0
y'all	1
got	0
the	0
individual	1
containers	0
yet	0

no	1
i	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
paper	1
this	0
week	0
where	1
maybe	1
i	1
don't	1
know	0
if	0
it	0
w[as]	1
was	0
i	0
guess	1
maybe	0
this	1
week	0
someone	0
may	1
start	1
getting	1
them	1
if	0
the	0
truck	0
that	1
picks	0
them_1	1
up	1
is	0
outfitted	1
in	1
time	0

hm	0

but	1
i	0
it	0
it	1
should	0
be	1
starting	1
i	1
would	1
stay	1
probably	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
month	1
if	1
if	1
everything	1
goes	1
that	0
uh	1
i'm	1
not	1
sure	1
all	1
what	1
we're	1
gonna	1
have	0
to	1
do	1
whether	1
we	1
have	1
three	1
separate	1
containers	1
i	1
really	1
don't	0
understand	1
that	1
part	1
on	0
what	1
they've	0
told	1
you	1
to	0
separate	0
everything	1

right	0
yeah	1
it	0
seemed	1
like	1
uh	0
if	0
if	0
i	0
recall	1
it's	0
been	0
a	0
long	1
time	0
they're	0
way	1
behind	0
schedule	1
on	0
that	1
particular	0
part	0
of	0
it	0
they	0
were	0
fine	1
on	0
the	0
green	1
big	1
green	0
containers	0
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
seems	1
like	0
they	0
said	1
they	0
were	0
just	0
gonna	0
have	0
a	0
bin	1
and	0
all	0
s[orts]	0
different	0
types	1
would	0
go	0
in	0
there	1
and	0
then	0
that	0
they	1
would	0
sort	1
it	0
as	0
as	0
needed	1
it	0

oh	1

it	0
it	0
seemed	1
that	0
there	0
was	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
anyway	1
the	0
thinking	0
was	1
that	0
there	1
was	0
too	1
much	0
not	1
getting	0
sorted	1
properly	1
and	0
that	0
at	0
at	0
the	0
collection	1
sites	0
where	0
everything's	0
clearly	1
labeled	0
and	0
people	0
that	0
happen	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
trouble	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
happen	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
pretty	0
well	1
uh	0
those	1
are	0
okay	1
to	0
have	0
the	0
general	1
public	1
doing	0
the	0
sorting	1
but	0
when	0
it	0
comes	1
down	1
to	0
just	0
general	1
purpose	0
trash	1
that	0
all	1
the	0
houses	1
um	0
the	0
success	1
rate	0
of	0
getting	0
it	0
sorted	1
properly	1
seemed	0
to	0
be	0
poor	1
so	0
they	0
felt	1
that	0
having	1
one	1
guy	1
just	0
sit	1
there	0
and	0
run	0
through	1
it	0
real	0
quick	0
was	0
better	1
than	0
than	0
having	0
a	0
household	1
try	0
it	0
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
sounds	0
like	0
an	0
awful	1
lot	0
of	0
labor	1
to	0
sort	0
the	0
entire	1
week's	0
worth	0
of	0
trash	1
for	0
a	0
house	0

well	1
it'd	0
get	0
messy	1
too	0

yeah	1
yeah	0

i	0
i	0
i	0
know	0
other	0
places	1
when	0
they	0
recycle	1
they	1
have	0
to	1
like	0
wash	1
out	0
their	1
glass	1
jars	0
and	1
whatnot	1
and	0
uh	0
which	0
we're	0
not	1
in	0
the	0
habit	0
of	0
doing	1
i	1

right	1

that's	1
true	0

i	1
was	0
brought	0
up	0
uh	0
you	1
know	0
long	1
time	1
ago	1
that	0
they	0
didn't	0
even	0
have	1
cans	0
they	0
had	0
bottles	1
and	0
you'd	0
return	0
them	0
to	0
the	0
the	0
grocery	0
store	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
you'd	0
get	0
your	0
money	0
back	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
all	0
well	1
and	0
good	1
and	0
they	0
don't	0
seem	1
to	1
still	1
be	0
doing	1
that	1
if	0
they	1
could	0
just	0
eliminate	1
the	1
cans	0
and	0
use	1
glass	1
but	1
i	0
guess	1
this	1
day	0
and	1
age	0
they	0
don't	1

yeah	1

they	1
don't	1
do	1
that	1
we	1
live	1
next	0
to	1
a	0
set	1
of	1
railroad	1
tracks	1
and	1
it	0
seemed	1
to	0
be	0
a	1
very	1
popular	1
thing	1
for	0
people	0
driving	1
by	1
that	0
highway	1
there	0
by	0
our	1
tracks	1
to	1
throw	0
the	0
bottles	0
at	1
the	0
tracks	0
and	0
try	0
to	0
crash	1
you	0
know	0
break	1
them_1	0
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
they	0
weren't	1
that	0
successful	1
so	0
there	0
were	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
bottles	1
to	0
be	0
returned	0
and	0
we	0
just	0
walk	1
about	0
a	0
half	1
a	0
mile	0
in	0
each	0
direction	1
and	0
gathered	0
up	0
enough	0
to	0
buy	1
whatever	0
we	0
wanted	1
for	0
the	0
day	1
[laughter-and]	0

um-hum	0

[laughter-and]	0

yeah	1
and	0
they	0
uh	0
p[eople]	0
i	0
i	0
think	1
kids	1
don't	0
appreciate	1
maybe	1
the	0
value	1
of	1
money	1
that	0
it's	0
so	1
little	1
that	0
they	1
don't	0
care	1
they	0
can	1
get	0
more	1
somewhere	0
else	1
uh	0

yeah	0
just	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
begging	1
will	0

uh	0
for	0
a	0
good	1
many	0
right	0
they're	1
the	0
the	0
nickels	1
the	0
dimes	1
or	0
what	0
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-suppose]	0
[laughter-it]	0
[laughter-might]	1
be	0
quarter	1
and	0
fifty	1
cent	1
pieces	0
in	1
these	1
days	0
that	1
they	1
would	0
get	1
they	0
the	0
kids	1
just	0
don't	1
seem	0
to	0
to	0
care	1
that	1
that	0
much	1
about	0
a	0
small	1
amount	0
of	0
money	1

right	0
well	1
i	1
wonder	0
if	0

but	0
now	0
we	0
we	1
did	0
buy	0
a	0
can	1
crusher	0
and	0
we	0
are	1
crushing	0
cans	0
and	0
when	0
we	0
buy	1
the	0
soda	1
when	0
it's	0
on	0
sale	1
for	0
ninety	1
nine	1
cents	1
so	0
i	1
would	0
say	0
in	0
the	0
last	0
three	1
years	1
we've	0
probably	0
used	1
a	0
lot	1
more	1
cans	0
than	0
ever	1
before	0

yeah	0

um	1
it	1
was	0
just	1
easier	1
to	0
do	0
that	1
than	0
to	1
open	0
a	1
large	1
liter	1
bottle	1
and	1
then	1
have	1
it	0
go	1
flat	1

right	0
yep	0

so	0
that's	1
the	0
main	1
reason	0
we're	0
we	0
uh	1
sort	0
of	1
are	1
into	1
cans	1
[laughter-at]	1
[laughter-this]	0
point	1
rather	1
than	0
the	0
liter	1
[laughter-bottles]	0

where	1
do	0
you	0
take	1
your	0
cans	0

well	1
as	0
you	0
say	1
it	0
takes	0
a	0
while	1
to	0
build	0
it	0
up	1
since	0
we've	1
had	0
the	1
crusher	1
all	0
summer	1
we	0
i	0
guess	1
we	1
just	1
now	1
maybe	0
have	1
a	0
bag	1
full	1
that	1
we	0
haven't	0
ta[ken]	0
oh	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
kids	1
when	0
we	0
were	0
on	0
vacation	0
they	0
said	0
they	0
did	0
take	0
them_1	0
to	0
a	0
a	0
recycling	1
place	0
probably	0
at	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
li[braries]	0

okay_1	1

well	1

you're	1
from	1
iowa	1

did	0
you	1
need	0
a	1
loom	1
or	0
were	1
you	0
a[ble]	0
was	1
it	0
small	1
enough	0
that	1
you	1
could	0
just	1
hold	1
it	0

um	1
i	0
put	1
it	0
on	1
the	0
frame	1
the	0
quilting	1
frame	1
have	0
you	0
are	0
you	0
familiar	1
with	0
that	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
okay	1

but	0
um	0
my	0
again	1
my	1
mother	1
back	1
in	0
indiana	1
we	1
had	0
a	0
quilting	1
frame	1
in	0
our	1
basement	1
and	0
she	1
would	0
she	1
would	0
quilt	1
whole	0
quilts	1
by	0
herself	1

oh	0
my	0
god	1

um	1
yes	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
always	1
amazed	1
i	1
have	1
one	1
of	0
them_1	0
um	0
but	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
have	1
the	0
quilting	1
frame	1
and	0
then	0
to	0
actually	1
do	1
that	0
it's	0
a	0
tremendous	1
amount	0
of	0
work	1

well	1
i	1
haven't	1
done	1
tons	1
of	0
them_1	0
but	0
um	0
i	0
used	1
to	1
do	0
more	1
before	1
um	1
before	1
i	0
had	0
before	1
we	0
got	0
our	0
baby	1
but	0

have	0
you	1
think	1
children	1
you	1
can	0
um	1
use	0
crafts	1
to	1
make	0
wonderful	1
things	1
for	1
children	1

uh-huh	0

i	0
think	1
when	0
babies	1
i	0
think	0
afghans	1
and	0
and	1
the	1
crocheted	1
little	0
sweaters	1
and	0
are	0
are	0
wonderful	1
and	0
and	1
they'll	0
wear	1
them_1	0

yeah	1
exactly	1

once	1
they	0
get	0
old	1
enough	0
to	1
talk	1
then	0
they	0
no	1
longer	0
will	0
wear	1
[laughter-your]	0

well	0
one	1
thing	0
that	0
i	0
like	0
about	0
this	0
fabric	1
painting	0
thing	0
is	0
i	1
can	1
just	0
make	0
a	0
t-shirt	1
and	0
put	0
a	0
little	0
ruffle	1
around	0
it	0
and	0
then	1
um	0
cut	1
out	0
a	0
little	0
pattern	1
from	1
the	0
material	1
from	0
some	1
material	0
like	0
flowers	1
or	0
something	0
and	0
make	1
um	0
a	0
design	1
or	0
you	1
know	0
a	0
little	0
arrangement	1
or	0
something	1
on	0
the	0
shirt	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
fuse	1
it	0
on	0
with	0
heat	1
and	0
bond	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
then	1
paint	1
around	1
it	0
and	0
i	0
usually	1
sew	1
sew	1
around	1
the	0
flower	1
whatever	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
i	0
paint	1
around	1
it	0
so	1
you	0
can't	1
see	1
the	0
stitching	1
as	0
much	1
doe[s]	0
does	0
that	1
make	0
sense	1
to	0
you	0
so	0

oh	0
yes	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
very	0
clever	1
it's	1
uh	0
funny	1
that	0
you	0
said	1
that	0
for	1
christmas	1
my	0
daughter	1
and	0
i	0
received	1
matching	1
sweat	1
shirts	0
that	0
a	0
friend	1
had	0
made	0
for	1
ours	0
a	0
beautiful	1
christmas	1
design	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0
they	1
were	1
matching	1
and	0
they	0
were	0
lovely	1
but	1
when	0
i	1
washed	1
them	0
although	0
i	1
took	1
the	1
precaution	1
of	0
turning	1
them	1
inside	0
out	1
i	0
really	1
didn't	0
do	0
anything	0
else	1
and	0
truly	1
everything	1
fell	0
off	1
or	1
most	1
of	0
it	1
so	0

oh	0
sure	1

uh-huh	0

oh	0
really	1

so	0
i	1
ha[d]	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
bought	1
just	0
some	1
cloth	1
glue	1
and	1
glued	1
it	0
all	1
back	1
and	0
i	0
bought	1
the	0
paint	1
and	1
redid	1
most	0
of	1
the	0
edges	1

oh	0

and	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
[laughter-salvageable]	1
and	0
i	0
but	0
it's	0
so	1
i'm	0
familiar	1
with	0
that	0
but	0
i	0
think	1
you're	0
very	0
clever	1
to	0
um	0
sew	1
around	1
the	0
edges	0
i	0
think	0
gluing	1
alone	1
certainly	1
would	0
if	0
you	0
wash	1
it	0
any	0
amount	0
of	0
time	1
it	0
tends	1
to	0
kind	0
of	0
come	0
loose	1
at	0
the	0
edges	1

well	0

yeah	1
someone	1
told	1
me	0
that	0
that	0
it	0
that	0
they	0
had	0
done	1
it	0
both	1
ways	0
and	0
i've	1
always	0
after	1
hearing	1
that	0
i	0
always	0
sewed	1
it	0
on	0
even	1
even	1
with	0
the	0
uh	0
a	0
loose	1
zigzag	1
even	0
helps	1
and	0
um	0

what	1
kind	1
of	1
car	1
do	1
you	1
drive	1
now	1

i	1
drive	1
a	1
honda	1
prelude	1
and	1

do	1
you	1
i	1
drive	1
a	1
honda	1
accord	1

oh	1
[laughter-yeah]	1

[laughter-yeah]	1

i	1
bought	1
mine	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
so	0
i'm	1
not	1
buying	1
a	0
car	1
any	0
time	1
[laughter-soon]	1

yeah	1
me	1
either	1
i	1
just	1
bought	1
mine	1
uh	0
it'll	1
be	1
a	0
year	1
in	1
august	1

yeah	1

i	1
love	1
it	1
though	1

a	0
standard	1

but	1
um	0

supposedly	1
real	1
reliable	1
the	0
only	1
thing	1
i've	0
ever	0
heard	1
about	1
hondas	1
is	0
that	1
the	1
breaks	1

oh	1
really	1

yeah	1

i	1
hadn't	1
heard	1

yeah	0

what	1
did	1
you	1
have	1
before	1
you	0
bought	1
that	1

i	1
had	1
a	1
buick	0
regal	1

did	1
you	0

yeah	0

i	0

uh	0
mazda	1
rx	0

and	0
that	1
was	1
the	1
worse	1
car	1
i've	1
ever	1
driven	1
in	1
my	0
life	1

the	1
buick	1
was	1
was	1
great	1
it	1
was	0
nine	1
years	0
old	1
and	1
and	0
it	1
was	1
still	1
going	1
strong	1
and	0

really	1

the	1
only	1
problems	1
i	1
had	0
had	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
nine	1
years	1
that	1
i	1
owned	1
it	0
i	1
had	1
to	0
replace	1
the	1
compressor	1
when	1
it	0
was	1
about	1
seven	1
years	1
old	1

really	1

and	1
that	1
was	0
the	1
only	1
major	1
problem	1
that	0
i	0
had	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
had	1
little	1
piddly	1
things	1
like	1
i	0
had	0
to	0
replace	1
the	0
muffler	1
and	1

yeah	0

and	1
i	0
had	0
replaced	1
the	1
tires	1
and	1
uh	0
seems	1
like	1
it	1
had	1
a	0
radiator	1
leak	1
once	1
but	0
i	1
never	1
had	0
any	1
major	1
anything	1
other	1
than	0
the	0
compressor	1

right	0

i	1
never	0
really	0
had	0
anything	0
major	1
with	0
my	0
mazda	1
but	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
standard	1
also	1
and	0
the	1
clutch	1
went	0
out	1
on	0
it	1
toward	1
the	1
end	1
i	0
had	0
it	1
five	1
years	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
year	1
or	0
last	1
two	1
years	1
it	0
seemed	1
to	1
go	0
out	1
really	1
easily	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
went	0
out	0
twice	1
in	0
two	0
years	1
and	0
that's	1
that's	1
a	0
lot	1
it	0
shouldn't	1
go	0
out	1
that	0
much	1

no	1
hm	0

and	1
so	1
i	0
went	1
ahead	1
and	0
bought	0
another	1
standard	1
when	1
i	1
bought	1
the	0
honda	1
but	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
i'm	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
that	0
again	1
i	0
think	0
i'm	1
going	0
back	0
to	0
automatic	1
now	1

well	1
i	0
never	1
w[ell]	1
well	0
i	0
kind	1
of	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
standard	1
but	1
i've	0
never	1
owned	0
one	1
so	0
i	0
had[n't]	1
i	0
don't	0
drive	1
one	0
a	0
lot	1

right	1

so	1
i	0
don't	1
f[eel]	0
feel	0
comfortable	1
in	0
traffic	1
with	0
it	1

right	1

and	1
for	0
everything	1
i've	0
heard	1
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
easier	0
to	0
sell	1
an	0
automatic	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1

and	1
and	0
resale	1
value	1
is	0
really	1
important	0
to	0
me	1

that's	0
true	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1
me	0
too	1
that's	0
why	1
i	0
got	0
the	0
honda	1

yeah	0

hondas	1
have	0
great	1
resale	1
value	0

yeah	0

the	0
mazda	1
definitely	1
did	0
not	1
not	1
at	0
[laughter-all]	1
they're	1
worse	1
than	0
american	1
cars	0
i	0
think	1
or	0
just	1
as	0
bad	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
resale	1
goes	1

i	1
did	0
pretty	0
well	1
with	0
my	1
uh	0
regal	1
because	0
it	1
was	1
in	0
really	1
good	1
shape	1
but	0
it	1
still	1
looked	1
real	0
nice	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
interior	1
was	1
still	1
really	0
nice	1
there	0
[what'n/wasn't]	1
cracks	1
all	0
over	0
the	0
dash	1
board	0
and	0
stuff	1
an[d]	1

right	1

and	0
it	0
had	1
some	1
some	1
nice	0
features	1
so	0
i	1
ended	0
up	0
okay	1
with	0
the	0
buick	1

good	1

and	0
i	0
anticipate	1
the	0
same	0
thing	1
with	0
the	0
honda	1
whenever	0
i	0
decide	1
to	0
sell	1
it	0
course	0
i	0
may	0
never	1
sell	1
it	0

[laughter-right]	1

i	0
may	1
drive	1
it	1
till	0
it's	0
dead	1
but	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
that's	1
what	0
i	0
did	1
with	1
the	0
mazda	1
drive	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
till	1
the	0
clutch	1
went	1
out	1
and	0
the	0
wheels	1
fell	1
off	1
[laughter-so]	1

yeah	0

[laughter-so]	1
probably	1
what	1
i'll	0
do	0
again	1

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
really	1
like	1
the	0
hondas	1
i	1
like	0
foreign	1
cars	1
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

i	1
looked	1
at	0
the	0
mitsubishi	1
galant	1
i	1
was	1
looking	0
for	0
a	0
four	1
door	0
car	1
having	0
driven	1
the	0
rx	1
seven	0
so	0
long	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
it	1
was	0
so	1
small	1
and	0
it's	0
really	1
impractical	1
so	0
i	0
wanted	1
something	0
with	0
a	0
real	1
trunk	1
and	0
four	1
doors	1
something	0
easy	1
to	0
get	0
in	0
and	0
out	1
of	0
and	0
i	0
looked	1
at	0
the	1
galant	1
and	1
those	1
were	1
really	1
nice	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
them_1	1
for	0
a	1
great	1
price	1

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
found	1
it	1
hard	1
to	0
deal	1
with	0
the	1
dealership	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
through	0

oh	1

so	1
that's	1
how	1
i	1
ended	1
up	0
with	0
a	1
honda	1

i	0
wasn't	1
even	0
looking	1
for	0
a	0
car	1
when	0
i	1
bought	1
this	0
car	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
thinking	1
about	1
buying	1
a	0
prelude	1
from	0
a	1
friend	1
who	0
was	0
moving	1
to	0
new	1
york	1
or	0
something	1
so	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
gonna	1
sell	0
her	0
car	1
because_1	0
she	0
didn't	0
need	1
it	0
anymore	1
and	0
it	1
was	1
only	1
like	1
a	0
year	1
old	1
and	0
i	1
had	0
never	0
driven	1
uh	0
a	0
prelude	1
so	1
i	0
went	1
to	0
a	0
dealership	1
because	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
uh	0
the	0
same	1
year	1
and	0
same	1
model	0
of	0
prelude	1
on	0
their	0
used	1
car	1
lot	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
test	1
drove	1
it	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
just	0
fell	1
in	0
love	1
with	1
this	0
brand	1
new	1
white	1
prelude	1
you	0
know	1
two	1
liter	0
si	1
with	0
the	1
the	0
sun	1
roof	1
and	0
the	0
moon	1
roof	1
and	1

oh	1
yeah	0

they're	0
nice	1
i	0
think	1

and	1
i	1
i	0
bought	1
it	0
loaded	1

oh	1
yeah	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
loaded	1
i	1

i	0
mean	1

i	1
i	0
love	1
all	0
those	1
little	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
[laughter-don't]	0
need	1
but	0
they're	1
so	0
wonderful	1

yeah	0
i	1
went	1
there	1
looking	0
at	1
a	1
used	1
car	1
and	0
two	0
days	1
later	1
i	0
bought	1
this	0
car	1
i	1

i	0
felt	1
i	0
felt	1
like	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
worst	1
impulse	1
that	1
w[as]	0
that	1
was	0
the	0
largest	1
impulse	0
buy	1
i	0
had	1
ever	0
made	1
the	1

the	1
oth[er]	0
the	0
two	1
other	0
things	1
that	0
i've	0
bought	1
on	0
impulse	1
are	0
vcr	1
and	0
a	0
[laughter-washer]	1
and	0
dryer	1

i	0
would	0
[laughter-say]	1

i	0
go	1
for	0
the	0
big	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
i	0
noticed	1
mine	1
was	0
definitely	1
not	0
impulse	1
i	0
really	1
needed	0
a	0
new	0
car	1
mine	1
was	0
just	1
it's	0
getting	1
worn	1
out	0
i	0
guess	1
from	0
being	1
a	0
sports	0
car	1
i	1
drove	1
it	1
kind	0
of	0
hard	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	1
got	0
it	0
right	1
after	0
high	0
school	1
so	0
by	0
the	0
time	1
i	0
traded	1
it	0
in	1
it	1
was	0
[laughter-ready]	1

yeah	1
i	0
got	1
i	0
got	1
my	0
buick	1
as	0
a	0
high	1
school	0
graduation	0
gift	1

ready	1
to	0
[laughter-go]	1

did	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
this	0
[what'n/wasn't]	1
really	1
an	0
impulse	1
i	0
mean	0
buying	1
it	0
right	1
then	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
right	1
quickly	1
was	0
kind	1
of	0
impulsive	1
but	0
i'd	1
been	0
thinking	1
about	0
buying	1
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
three	1
years	0
and	0
i	0
was	1
just	0
scared	1
to	0

right	1

i	0
was	0
scared	1
to	0
start	0
taking	1
on	0
payments	1
because	0
the	0
buick	1
was	0
long	1
since	0
paid	1
for	0

right	1
that's	0
same	1
with	0
me	1
would	0
you	1
ever	0
buy	1
a	0
used	0
car	1
for	1
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
yourself	1

buy	0
a	1
buy	1
buy	1
a	0
used	0
car	1

like	1

right	1

sure	1

i	1
i	0
was	1
going	0
to	0
buy	1
one	0
once	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
worry	1
about	1
who's	0
driven	1
them_1	0
and	0
what	0
they've	1
been	0
through	1
and	0
the	0
warranties	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
just	1

yeah	0

just	1
i	0
can't	1
seem	0
to	0
get	1
over	0
that	1
that	0
just	1
bothers	0
[laughter-me]	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
why	1

well	1
um	0
like	1
on	0
hondas	1
they	1
supposedly	1
the	0
maintenance	1
records	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
registered	1
with	0
honda	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
you	1
can	0
request	1
whatever	0
maintenance	1
records	1
exist	1
on	0
cars	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
have	1
them_1	0
checked	1
out	0
by	0
mechanics	1
and	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

mean	0
they	0
can't	1
stop	1
you	0
from	0
doing	1
it	0
so	0

hoping	1
that	0
they	0
do	1
go	0
to	0
a	0
honda	1
dealership	1
to	0
get	0
them_1	0
serviced	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

well	1
and	0
even	1
if	0
they	0
didn't	1
you	0
can	0
still	1
get	0
a	0
good	0
idea	1
from	0
a	1
if	0
you	0
can	0
get	1
a	0
good	0
mechanic	1
to	0
check	1
it	0
over	0
real	0
carefully	1
and	0
check	1
the	0
blocks	1
and	0
everything	1

yeah	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

well	1
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
all	1

okay	1
well	0
i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	1
to	0
you	1

i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	0
to	0
you	1

bye-bye	1

bye-bye	1

okay	1
well	1
um	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
care	1
center	1

uh-huh	1

i	1
worked	1
in	0
um	1
in	1
all	1
the	0
different	0
areas	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
care	0
center	1
and	1
it	1
is	0
they	1
can	1
be	1
deceiving	1
to	1
people	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
work	0
there	1
long	1
because	1
i	0
couldn't	1
handle	1
the	1
the	1
treatment	1
that	0
the	1
children	1
got	1
and	0
this	1
is	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	1
a	0
very	1
well-known	0
center	1
here	0
in	0
tyler	1
who	0
had	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
um	0
centers	1
all	1
over	1
you	1
know	1
the	0
um	1
city	1
and	1

um-hum	0

and	1
they	1
would	1
um	0
be	0
one	1
way	1
when	0
the	0
parents	1
were	0
there	1
and	0
be	1
another	1
way	1
when	0
the	1
parents	0
left	1

yeah	1

so	1
um	1
i	0
think	1
you	1
need	1
to	0
make	1
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
do	1
do	1
day	1
care	1
centers	1
you	1
know	1
you	0
should	1
make	0
frequent	1
checks	1
and	1
um	0
to	1
check	0
in	1
on	0
them_1	0
when	0
they're	1
[laughter-not]	0
[laughter-expecting]	1
it	1

because	0
they	1
do	1
do	0
things	0
differently	1
when	1
you're	1
not	0
around	1
so	1

well	0
that	0
i	0
know	0
wh[at]	1
the	1
things	1
that	0
we	1
kind	1
of	0
looked	0
at	1
is	0
is	0
you	0
wanna	1
see	1
how	1
many	1
teachers	1
you	1
have	1
and	0
and	0
how	1
many	0
kids	1
they	0
have	0
and	0
how	1
they	0
break	0
it	1
up	1

um-hum	0

right	1

because	1
we	1
had	1
we	1
had	1
one	0
that	1
sounds	0
kind	1
of	0
like	0
what	0
you	1
were	0
in	1

um-hum	0

it	0
it	0
was	1
a	1
really	1
good	1
one	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
it	0
worked	0
out	1
for	0
us	1
because_1	1
my	0
wife	1
we	1
kind	0
of	0
bartered	1
my	1
wife	1
did	1
artwork	1
for	1
them_1	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
know	1
so	0
we	1
got	1
our	1
uh	0
day	1
care	1
free	1

um-hum	0

but	1
they	1
didn't	0
have	0
enough	0
teachers	1
and	1

well	0
this	1
one	0
was	0
set	0
up	1
good	1
i	1
mean	1
they	1
had	1
two	1
teachers	1
to	1
every	1
room	1
um	1
sometimes	1
three	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
they	0
had	1
a	0
good	1
system	1
like	0
so	1
when	0
you	0
walked	1
in	1
everything	1
looks	0
cool	1

um-hum	1

the	1
problem	0
i	1
had	0
was	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
affection	1
to	0
the	1
children	1
enough	1
they	1
did	1
not	0
show	1
them	0
care	1
to	0
these	0
small	1
children	1
who	0
are	0
being	0
left	1

um-hum	0

um	0
they	1
one	1
time	0
i	1
picked	0
up	1
this	1
little	1
boy	1
who	0
was	1
crying	1
and	0
the	1
owner	1
came	1
and	1
just	1
chewed	1
me	1
up	0
one	0
side	1
and	0
down	0
the	0
other	0
you	0
know	1
he	0

hm	0

he	0
said	0
you	1
are	0
gonna	0
have	0
every	1
child	0
in	0
here	0
wanting	0
you	0
to	0
pick	0
them_1	0
up	1

and	0
i	1
said	0
no	1
this	1
child	0
was	1
crying	1
and	0
needed	0
some	1
comfort	1
you	0
know	1
what	1

yeah	1

what	1
is	0
your	1
problem	0
so	1
um	1

did	1
did	1
they	0
separate	1
them_1	0
by	0
age	1
group	1

yes	1

because_1	0
i'd	1
think	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
that's	1
one	0
thing	0
that	0
was	0
important	1

right	1
they	0
did	1
they	0
had	1
like	0
um	0
the	0
the	0
crawlers	1
the	0
babies	1
that	0
didn't	1
walk	0
in	0
one	1
room	0
the	0
ones	1
that	0
were	0
starting	1
to	0
walk	0
in	0
one	0
room	1

uh-huh	0

then	0
they	0
had	1
like	1
the	0
um	0
three	1
three	0
year	0
olds	1
upper	1
fours	1
lower	1
fours	1
upper	0
fives	1
lower	0
fives	1
you	1
know	0
just	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	1

you	1
know	0
they	0
really	1
did	0
separate	1
them_1	0
well	0

it	0
it	0
sound	1
yeah	1

it	1
was	0
just	1
the	0
teachers	1
themselves	1

it	0
sounds	1
like	0
to	0
me	1
your	1
your	1
concern	1
would	1
be	0
to	1
make	0
sure	1
that	1
they	0
are	1
loving	1
people	0
affectionate	1
people	0
that	1
they're	1
they're	0
kind	1
of	0
par[ents]	0
maybe	0
parents	1
themselves	1
or	0
something	1

right	1

but	1
yeah	1
that	0
they're	1
not	0

yeah	1
their	0
system	1

right	1
but	0
their	1
but	0
their	0
system	1
was	0
was	0
great	1
but	0
um	0
the	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
caring	1
just	0
wasn't	0
there	1

um-hum	0

the	0
one	1
woman	1
that	0
taught	1
that	0
did	1
the	0
babies	1
i	0
worked	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
was	0
fabulous	1

um-hum	0

she	1
loved	1
them	1
babies	1
and	0
she	1
loved	1
them_1	0
and	0
cared	1
for	0
them_1	0
but	0
um	0
every	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
others	1
that	0
i	0
saw	1
was	0
just	0
screaming	1
and	0
yelling	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
would	0
make	1
me	1
a	0
nervous	0
wreck	1
[laughter-so]	0
you	1
know	0

yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
think	0
that's	0
probably	0
a	0
really	1
important	0
thing	1
because	0
you	1
can	0
have	0
doctorates	1
and	0
phd's	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
know	1
all	0
the	0
technical	1
stuff	0
but	0
if	0
they	0
don't	0
reach	0
out	1
and	0
touch	0
the	0
kids	1
then	0
that	1
doesn't	0
do	0
any	0
good	1

yeah	0
these	0
kids	1
are	0
just	0
in	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0
all	0
day	1
and	1
uh	0
with	0
no	1
any	0
type	0
of	0
emotional	1
you	0
know	1
getting	1
love	1
getting	0
care	1
they're	0

yeah	1

they're	0
just	1
there	1
you	0
know	1
going	1
through	0
this	0
routine	1
which	0
is	0
lousy	1

yeah	1

an[d]	0

the	1
other	1
the	1
other	1
group	1
that	0
we	1
had	1
was	0
kind	1
of	1
interesting	1
the	1
other	1
one	0
we	1
went	1
to	0
the	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
husband	1
and	0
wife	1
team	0

um-hum	0

and	0
we	1
knew	0
them	0
from	0
other	0
associations	1
but	0
uh	1
it	0
was	0
kind	1
of	1
interesting	1
because	0
she	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
the	1
strict	1
one	0
and	0
i	1
think	1
you	1
know	0
she	1
would	0
she'd	1
put	0
her	0
arm	1
around	0
the	0
kids	0
and	0
talk	1
to	0
them_1	1
and	1
stuff	1
you	0
know	1
but	0
he	1
was	0
actually	0
the	1
more	1
um	0
the	0
more	1
uh	1
what	0
demonstrative	1
type	1
the	0
more	1
loving	1
he	1

um-hum	0

he	1
would	0
you	1
know	0
laugh	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
play	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
and	1
it	0
it	0
it	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
interesting	1
to	0
see	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
actually	1
the	0
man	1
in	0
the	0
group	1
that	0
that	0
did	1
that	0
side	1
of	0
it	1

uh-huh	0

an[d]	1

yeah	0
you	0
don't	1
see	1
that	0
much	1

yeah	1
so	0
they	1
had	0
a	0
really	1
nice	0
balance	1
we	1
liked	1
that	0
one	0
in	0
fact	1
it	0
was	0
called	0
humpty	1
dumpty	1
play	1
school	0
or	0
something	1
but	0

that's	0
cute	1

but	0
they	0
also	1
did	1
they	0
also	1
did	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
teaching	1
things	1
and	0
then	0
they	0
had	1
um	0
you	0
know	1
obedience	1
obedience	1
was	0
important	1

yeah	0
that	0
has	1
to	0
be	1
with	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0

and	1
you	1
know	0
so	0
they	1
u[sed]	0
you	0
know	1
they	0
used	1
uh	0
oh	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
used	1
the	0
you	0
probably	0
heard	1
where	0
you	1
know	1
where	0
you	0
stand	1
in	0
front	1
of	1
the	0
clock	1
and	0
get	1
your	0
power	1
back	1
to	0
control	1
yourself	1

i've	0
never	1
heard	1
of	0
that	1
that's	1
that's	1
a	1
new	1
one	0
on	0
me	1

and	0
it's	0
it's	0
it's	0
one	1

uh	0
i	1
can't	0
remember	1
what	1
they	0
call	0
it	0
exactly	1
but	0
y[ou]	0
you	0
just	0
stand	1
them_1	0
in	0
front	0
of	0
the	0
clock	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
has	0
a	0
second	1
hand	0
that	0
goes	0
around	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	1
have	0
to	0
stand	1
there	0

i	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
i've	1
done	1
far	1
as	1
car	1
repairs	1
go	1
is	1
is	0
change	1
oil	1
and	1
filter	1
an	0
and	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
stuff	1
i	0
haven't	1
gotten	1
really	1
involved	1
in	1
anything	1
uh	1
extensive	1
in	1
car	1
repairs	1
in	1
oh	1
oh	1
probably	1
a	0
year	1
or	1
so	0
i	1
think	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
i	1
did	1
of	1
any	1
significance	1
was	0
change	1
the	1
water	1
pump	0
on	1
an	1
oldsmobile	1

yeah	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
similar	1
thing	1
that	1
i've	1
worked	1
on	1
cars	1
ever	1
since	1
i	1
was	1
uh	0
a	1
kid	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
ago	1
but	0
i've	1
gotten	1
to	1
the	0
point	1
where	0
uh	1
the	0
newer	1
cars	1
are	1
getting	1
so	1
complicated	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
that	1
uh	1
oh	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
cars	1
i	1
buy	1
i	1
try	0
to	0
buy	1
as	0
simple	1
a	1
car	1
as	1
possible	1

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
mean	0

so	0
you	0
know	0
changing	1
the	0
oil	1
changing	1
the	1
spark	1
plugs	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
them	0
now	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
don't	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
ignition	1
stuff	1
anymore	1
because	1
that's	0
all	1
solid	0
state	1
or	1
or	1
fuel	1
injected	1
so	0

yeah	0
they're	1
fuel	0
injected	0
and	1
so	0
there's	0

so	0
there	1
goes	0
the	1
carburetor	0
and	0
if	1
the	0
fuel	1
injection	0
system	0
breaks	0
down	1
there's	0
no	1
way	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
work	1
on	0
that	1

yeah	0

no	1
there's	1
no	0
way	1
somebody	0
once	1
said	1
uh	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
car	1
that	0
said	1
fuel	1
injection	0
on	1
the	0
side	1
of	0
it	1
and	0
a	1
woman	1
asked	1
me	1
what	0
that	1
meant	1
and	1
i	0
said	0
that	1
means	1
that	1
i	1
can't	1
work	1
on	0
it	0

oh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
basically	1
that's	0
it	0

you	0
know	1
they've	1
gotten	1
so	0
complicated	1
or	0
so	0
high	0
tech	1
that	0
uh	0
the	0
guys	1
average	0
guys	1
can't	1
really	0
go	0
out	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
garage	1
and	1
do	1
a	0
whole	0
lot	0
of	0
repairs	1
uh	0

yeah	0
i've	0
got	1
uh	0
an	0
eighty	1
four	1
chevy	0
van	1
that's	1
uh	0
a	0
one	1
ton	0
van	1
with	0
a	0
camper	1
conversion	1
on	0
it	0

yeah	0

it's	0
got	1
the	0
the	1
the	0
good	1
old	0
three	0
fifty	1
standard	1
engine	1
in	0
it	0

absolutely	1

regular	0
gas	0
engine	0
and	0
that	1
engine	0
i	0
understand	1
i	0
can	1
i	0
can	0
actually	1
work	1
on	0
that	0
engine	1

yeah	0
i	1
used	1
to	0
have	1
uh	1
chevy	1
van	1
it	1
was	0
a	0
short	1
van	1
that	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	1
in	0
it	0

yeah	1

uh-hum	0

and	0
basically	1
it	1
it	0
was	1
a	1
motor	1
and	0
you	0
didn't	1
have	0
all	1
the	1
other	0
junk	0
around	1
it	1

right	1

and	1
you	1
could	1
get	1
to	1
it	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
it	0

yeah	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
change	1
the	0
water	1
pump	0
in	0
that	1
here	1
about	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
and	1
it	0
was	0
really	1
fairly	0
easy	1
take	0
the	0
grill	1
out	1
and	0
the	0
radiator	1
out	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
just	0
stand	1
there	0
and	0
work	1
on	1
it	0

yeah	0
the	1
hardest	1
part	1
about	1
uh	1
water	1
pump	0
changes	1
is	0
getting	1
all	1
the	1
junk	1
off	0
before	1
you	0
can	1
get	1
too	1
it	1

well	1
that's	1
true	0
that	1
you're	0
right	0
you	1
know	1
by	0
the	1
time	0
you've	0
finally	1
got	0
down	1
to	0
it	1
i	1
was	0
hoping	1
i	0
could	0
remember	1
where	0
all	0
those	0
other	1
things	1
went	1

well	1
that's	0
kind	1
of	0
the	0
way	0
i	1
was	1
i	0
tried	1
to	0
remember	1
as	0
i	0
took	1
stuff	0
off	1
where	0
it	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
had	0
too	1
many	0
nuts	1
and	0
bolts	1
left	1
over	1
when	0
i	0
got	1
it	0
all	0
put	0
back	0
together	1

a	1
few	0
years	1
ago	0
i	0
had	1
an	0
oldsmobile	0
diesel	1
and	0
uh	0
the	0
uh	0
it	0
after	0
about	0
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	0
miles	1
the	0
injector	1
pump	0
went	1
out	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
uh	1
i	1
bought	1
it	1
when	1
we	0
were	1
living	1
in	0
lubbock	1
when	1
i	0
came	1
back	0
here	1
i	1
brought	0
the	1
car	1
back	1
here	1
and	1
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
diesels	0
got	0
pretty	0
unpopular	0
and	0
you	0
couldn't	1
sell	1
the	0
thing	0
i	0
mean	0
though	0
for	1
what	0
you	1
could	1
get	1
for	1
one	1
you	0
might	1
as	1
well	1
drive	1
it	0
over	0
a	1
cliff	1

oh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
the	0
injector	1
pump	0
went	0
bad	1
so	0
i	1
found	1
an	0
outfit	1
down	0
here	0
to	0
rebuild	1
it	0
and	1
uh	0
i	1
reinstalled	1
that	1
and	0

and	0
that	1
was	0
probably	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
miserable	1
things	0
i	0
had	0
gotten	0
into	1
in	0
a	0
long	0
time	1

i	0
don't	1
think	0
i'd	0
know	0
where	0
to	0
start	1
with	0
a	0
diesel	1

uh	0
well	0
if	0
you	0
know	0
diesels	1
don't	0
require	0
mechanics	1
they	0
require	0
plumbers	0

well	0
that's	0
true	0

and	0
uh	0

i	1
think	1
the	1
onl[y]	1
closest	1
thing	1
i've	1
come	1
to	0
to	0
a	1
diesel	1
is	1
i've	1
worked	1
for	0
a	0
tractor	1
repair	0
shop	1
uh	1
when	0
i	0
was	1
in	0
high	1
school	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
used	1
to	0
overhaul	1
farm	1
tractors	0
basically	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	0
were	1
nearly	0
all	1
all	1
diesel	1
but	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
cars	1
i've	0
never	1
never	1
been	0
involved	1
with	0
them	0

well	0
the	0
injector	1
nozzle	1
and	0
stuff	0
in	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
big	1
diesel	0
farm	1
tractors	1
you	0
know	1
what	1
are	0
about	0
the	0
size	1
of	0
your	1
thumb	1
and	1
the	0

well	1
ye[ah]	0
yeah	0
and	1
you	1
ca[n]	1
you	0
can	1
get	1
to	1
them	0

yeah	0
you	0
can	0
get	1
to	0
them	1
and	0
the	0
ones	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
diesel	1
cars	1
were	0
little	1
tiny	0
things	1
and	0
just	0
almost	1
impossible	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
with	0

well	0
i	0

i've	0
had	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
good	0
service	1
out	0
of	0
that	0
car	1
but	0
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
finally	1
gave	0
it	0
to	0
my	0
son	1
and	0
he	1
drove	0
it	0
literally	1
into	0
the	0
ground	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

yeah	0

he	0
was	0
out	0
at	0
tech	1
and	1
he	1
he	0
finished	1
it	1
off	1

i'm	1
i	1
guess	0
you're	0
right	1
the	0
the	0
diesel	1
has	0
almost	1
fallen	0
into	1
unpopular	1
status	1
i	1
don't	1
know	0
exactly	1
why	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
reasons	1
is	0
i	1
i'm	1
beginning	1
to	0
wonder	1
is	0
where	1
do	0
you	0
get	0
gas	1
at	1
i	1
su[re]	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
if	1
it's	0
still	1
uh	0
limited	1
like	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
don't	1
notice	1
it	0
probably	1
because	0
i	1
don't	1

what	0
the	0
availability	0

huh	0

you	0
mean	0
the	0
diesel	0
availability	0

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
notice	0
but	0
maybe	0
because	0
i'm	0
not	1
looking	1
for	1
it	0

yeah	0
well	0
i'd	1
bought	1
uh	0
a	0
gmc	1
diesel	0
pickup	1
and	1
uh	0
loved	1
that	0
thing	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
really	0
liked	0
it	0
but	0
it	0
turns	1
out	0
a	0
pickup	1
wasn't	0
what	0
i	0
really	1
needed	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
the	0
van	1
that	0
i	0
needed	0
then	1
to	0
buying	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
traded	1
it	0
in	0
on	0
the	0
chevy	0
van	1
but	1
uh	0
i	0
sure	1
enjoyed	1
it	0

but	1
you	0
you	0
got	1
the	0
you	1
got	1
the	0
three	1
fifty	1
in	0
the	0
van	1

yeah	1
yeah	0
the	1
three	0
fifty	0
regular	1
gas	0
engine	1

yeah	0
that's	1
what	0
i	0
like	0
because	1
they've	0
got	1
plenty	0
of	0
power	1
and	0
uh	0
if	0
you	0
treat	1
them	0
right	1
they're	0
not	1
the	0
gas	1
guzzlers	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
they've	1
got	1
the	0
reputation	1
to	0
be	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	1
convinced	1
that	0
uh	0
detroit	1
or	0
whoever	1
it	0
is	0
made	1
a	0
major	1
mistake	1
years	1
ago	0
when	1
they	0
stopped	1
putting	1
the	1
small	1
v	1
eights	1
in	0
and	1
went	1
to	0
the	1
fours	1
and	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
sixes	1

yeah	0
well	0

i'm	0
convinced	1
that	0
the	0
small	1
v	0
eight	1
like	0
the	1
the	0
mustang's	1
original	0
two	1
eighty	1
nine	1
or	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
chevy	1
two	0
eighty	0
threes	1
were	0
good	1
little	1
v	1
eight	0
engines	1
that	0
were	0
not	1
gas	0
guzzlers	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
they	0
had	1
enough	0
power	1
to	0
pull	1
all	0
this	0
weight	1

yeah	0

and	0
the	0
four	1
cylinders	0
just	0
don't	0
have	1
it	0

think	1
that	0
little	1
the	0
little	1
chevy	1
v	0
eight	0
when	0
it	0
started	1
out	0
in	0
sixty	0
in	0
fifty	0
five	1
i	0
think	0
was	0
two	1
sixty	0
five	1
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

little	0
you	0
know	0
not	0
a	0
hold	0
lot	0
more	0
than	0
the	0
than	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
was	0
like	1
about	0
for	0
about	0
two	1
thirty	0
five	1
or	0
something	0
but	0
uh	0
they	1
kept	0
boring	1
that	0
block	0
out	1
to	0
where	1
you	0
could	0
a	0
get	1
a	0
four	1
hundred	1
small	1
block	0
four	0
hundred	1
that	0
was	1
uh	0
the	0
same	1
block	1
you	0
know	1
just	1
just	0
kept	0
boring	1
it	0
out	1
and	0
boring	1
it	0
out	1
and	0
stroking	1
it	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
yeah	0

i	1
think	0
those	1
g[uys]	0
those	1
little	0
v	1
eights	1
could	1
have	0
been	1
made	1
to	1
be	0
pretty	1
powerful	1
little	0
engines	1
if	0
they	0
would	0
have	1
gone	0
with	1
it	0
but	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
short	1
stroke	0
engine	1
it	0
could	0
really	0
wind	1
up	1

oh	0
yeah	1

the	0
two	1
little	0
cars	1
i've	0
got	0
now	1
bought	1
a	0
mitsubishi	1
mirage	0
here	0
a	0
couple	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
and	0
it	0
was	1
normally	0
carbureted	1
and	0
it's	0
fairly	1
easy	0
to	0
to	0
work	1
with	0
because	0
there's	0
not	1
just	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	1
in	1
it	0
to	0
go	0
wrong	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
changing	0
the	0
plugs	0
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
that's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	1

the	0
the	0
first	1
well	0
my	0
first	0
car	1
was	0
a	0
fifty	0
six	0
mustang	1
and	0
uh	0
over	0
the	0
years	0
uh	0
all	0
i	0
had	1
a	0
uh	0
dodge	1
pickup	1
several	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
can't	0
remember	1
the	0
size	0
of	0
the	0
engine	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
three	0
o	1
seven	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
remember	1
working	1
on	0
those	0
cars	1
you'd	0
open	1
the	0
hood	1
and	0
there	0
was	0
basically	1
nothing	0
in	1
there	0
but	0
an	0
engine	1
and	0
a	0
few	1
things	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

now	1
you	0
open	1
the	0
hood	1
and	0
it's	0
scary	0

yeah	0

like	0
you	0
say	1
it	0
takes	1
a	0
plumber	1
to	0
figure	0
out	1
where	0
all	0
this	0
stuff	0
goes	1

the	0
friend	1
of	0
ours	0
over	0
here	1
he's	0
got	1
uh	0
sixty	0
five	1
or	0
sixty	1
six	0
mustang	1
with	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
look	0
under	0
the	0
hood	1
of	0
that	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
and	1
like	0
you	1
say	0
you	0
can	0
see	1
the	0
road	1

yeah	0

it's	0
amazing	0

well	1
if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
you	0
could	0
climb	1
up	0
in	1
there	0
and	0
do	1
what	0
you	0
needed	1
to	0

you	0
could	1
yeah	1
you	0
could	0
stand	1
in	0
there	0
if	0
you	0
really	0
wanted	1
to	0
i	0
guess	1

my	0
dad's	0
got	0
a	0
new	1
um	0
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
an	0
eighty	1
nine	0
or	0
ninety	1
uh	0
chrysler	1
something	1
or	0
other	0
it's	0
one	0
those	0
transverse	1
mounted	1
v	0
sixes	1
front	1
wheel	0
drive	1

oh	0
yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
he	0
was	0
showing	1
it	0
to	0
me	1
and	0
we're	0
looking	1
under	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
everything's	0
nice	0
and	0
clean	0
and	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
can	0
see	1
the	0
three	1
spark	1
plugs	0
there	0
in	0
the	0
front	1
and	0
i	0
said	0
well	0
where	0
are	0
the	0
other	0
three	0

and	0
he	0
had	1
never	0
really	0
thought	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	0

and	0
he	0
says	0
well	0
hopefully	1
i	0
won't	0
have	0
to	0
change	1
them	0
before	1
i	0
trade	0
it	0
off	1
yeah	0
it's	0
going	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
problem	1
getting	0
back	1
there	0
because	0
it	0
was	0
shoved	1
right	0
up	0
against	1
the	0
fire	0
wall	1

yeah	0

so	0
they	0
just	1
about	0
complicated	1
the	0
things	0
so	0
much	1
that	0
shade	0
tree	0
mechanics	1
can't	1
do	0
much	0
with	1
them	0

yeah	0
well	0
when	0
they	0
went	1
to	0
the	1
started	1
with	0
the	0
newer	0
engines	1
you	0
know	0
when	0
they	0
started	0
putting	0
all	0
that	0
pollution	0
control	0
stuff	0
on	0
the	0
older	0
engines	0
is	0
where	0
they	0
started	0
getting	0
into	0
so	0
much	0
you	0
know	0
trouble	0
because	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	0
with	0
all	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
like	0
well	0
actually	0
i	0
guess	0
here	0
within	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	0
ago	0
anyway	0
was	0
the	0
last	0
i've	0
paid	0
any	0
attention	1
to	0
it	0
the	0
three	0
o	0
five	1
was	0
that	1
that	1
v	0
eight	1
that	0
they	0
put	1
in	0
the	1
the	0
three	0
quarter	1
and	0
and	0
half	1
ton	0
van	1
and	0

right	0

and	0

had	0
all	1
the	0
air	0
pump	1
and	0
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
all	1
that	0
all	1
that	0
stuff	1

right	0

yeah	0
the	0
antismog	0
pumps	0

and	0
all	0
the	0
antismog	0
stuff	0
and	0
uh	0
boy	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
really	0
a	0
mess	1
back	0
under	0
there	1
under	0
the	1
in	0
that	0
van	1

and	0
all	1
that	0
stuff	0
loads	1
the	0
motor	1
down	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

so	0
it's	0
trying	0
to	0
push	1
the	0
weight	1
plus	0
have	0
all	1
this	0
drain	1
on	0
it	0
from	0
all	0
sorts	1
of	0
belts	1

serpentine	1
belt	1

had	1
to	0
struggle	1
with	0

for	0
a	0
while	0
to	0
figure	0
which	1
belt	1

where	1

yeah	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	0
the	0
inside	1
dual	1
on	0

hysterical	1
i	1
was	1
i	1
mean	0

and	0
they	1
laughed	1
at	1
me	0
they	0
thought	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
[laughter-hysterical]	1

oh	0
no	0
i	1
understand	0
we	0
have	0
uh	0
we've	0
gone	0
through	0
the	0
same	1
thing	1
with	0
ours	0
we've	0
cut	0
you	0
know	0
they've	0
been	0
ill	0
i	0
mean	0
i	1
take	0
off	0
work	1
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
my	0
cats	1
you	0
know	0
th[e]	0

oh	0
[laughter-yeah]	1

my	0
boss	1
thinks	0
i'm	0
absolutely	0
crazy	0

and	0
then	0
we	1
had	0
a	1
baby	1
and	1
its	1
like	1
all	1
right	1
who	1
comes	0
first	1
the	0
cat	1
or	0
the	0
baby	1

the	0
cat	1
was	0
here	0
first	1
so	0
i	0
know	1
it's	1
hard	1

and	0
and	1
then	1
when	0
we	0
go	0
to	0
sleep	1
at	1
night	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0
like	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
to	0
try	0
to	1
get	0
any	1
space	1
on	0
the	0
bed	1
because	0
we	1
have	0
all	1
four	1
of	1
them	0
up	0
there	1
with	1
us	1

oh	0
how	0
funny	1

it's	1
like	0
all	1
right	1
whose	1
corners	1
is	1
this	0
one	1

that's	0
sweet	1
i	0
have	0
the	1
two	1
the	0
other	1
two	0
cats	0
i	0
have	0
are	0
outdoor	1
cats	0

oh	0
uh-huh	1

and	0
they	1
didn't	1
used	0
to	1
be	0
actually	1
but	0
they	0
got	0
kind	0
of	0
wild	1
and	0
weren't	0
doing	0
very	0
well	1
[laughter-inside]	1
so	0
i	0
put	0
them	1
outside	1
once	0
i	1
got	0
a	1
house	1
and	1
they're	1
doing	0
great	1
out	1
there	1
they	0
love	1
it	1
but	0
the	1
other	1
one	0
the	0
first	1
one	1
i	1
got	1
he	1
doesn't	1
want	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
outside	1
unless	1
you're	0
there	1

oh	0
uh-huh	1

other	0
than	0
that	1
he	1
gets	0
scared	1
to	0
death	1
if	0
you	1
shut	1
that	0
door	1
he	0
goes	0
into	1
hiding	1

oh	0

i	1
think	0
it's	1
from	1
the	0
time	1
he	1
jumped	1
off	1
the	1
[laughter-balcony]	1
and	1

yes	1
uh-huh	0

and	1
lord	0
knows	1
what	1
happened	1
to	0
him	1
[laughter-but]	1
[laughter-he's]	1
probably	1
been	1
through	0
all	1
kinds	0
of	1
nightmares	1

[laughter-right]	0
traumatized	1
for	1
life	1
here	0

probably	1

oh	0
yeah	0
we've	0
all	1
four	0
of	0
ours	0
are	0

cats	0
but	0
our	1
neighbor	0
decided	1
he	1
didn't	0
like	0

uh	0
a	0
really	1
good	0
day	1
care	0
is	0
probably	0
going	0
to	0
cost	1
more	0
than	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
make	0
at	0
the	0
job	1

and	0
and	1
uh	1
we'll	0
see	1
how	1
the	1
generations	0
go	1
huh	0

yeah	1
i	0
at	0
least	1
for	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	0
depending	1
on	1
on	0
what	0
she	0
did	1
i've	1

yeah	1

i've	1
i	1
was	0
an	0
engineer	1
with	0
uh	1
mechanical	1
engineer	0
with	0
t	0
i	1
and	1
uh	0
i	1
did	0
it	0
for	0
six	1
years	1
and	1
for	0
one	1
well	0
i	0
had	1
one	1
while	0
i	0
was	0
pregnant	1
and	0
then	0
one	1
while	0
my	1
oldest	1
was	0
a	0
year	0
old	1
and	0
and	1
it	0
just	0
drove	1
me	0
crazy	1

did	0
you	0

i	1
could	0
not	0
do	1
either	1
well	1
enou[gh]	0
i	1
couldn't	0
put	0
in	1
enough	1
overtime	1
that	0
was	1
necess[ary]	1
or	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
things	1
that	1
would	0
come	1
up	1
at	1
work	1
that	0
would	0
require	1
me	1
to	0
stay	0
late	1
or	0
to	0
come	0
in	0
early	1
or	0
to	1
do	0
something	0
on	0
saturdays	1
as	1
is	0
you	1
know	0
as	1
is	0
needed	1
and	0
because	1
my	0
husband	1
had	0
had	0
for	0
a	1
long	1
time	0
was	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
country	1
also	1
with	0
uh	0
with	0
work	1
for	0
like	0
three	1
months	0
and	0

um-hum	0

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
and	0

so	0
it	0
was	0
you	1
and	0
the	0
kid	1
and	0
your	0
work	1
schedule	1
is	0

yeah	1

well	0
that's	1
the	0
thing	0
see	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	1
if	0
you	0
get	0
along	0
for	0
example	0
if	0
you'd	1
been	0
a	0
technician	1
instead	1
of	1
an	0
engineer	1
you	0
know	0
the	1
technicians	1
work	0
the	1
eight	0
to	1
five	1
job	1
and	1
and	0
know	1
when	1
they're	1
going	1
to	0
be	1
there	0

yeah	1
it	0
might	1
have	1
been	1
better	1

yeah	1

but	1
uh	0
if	1
you're	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
pro[fessional]	1
professional	1
oriented	1
then	0
you've	0
got	1
to	1
have	0
this	1
to	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
perform	1
well	0
on	0
the	0
job	1
you've	0
got	1
to	0
have	0
the	0
flexibility	1
that	1
that	0
doesn't	1
really	0
go	1
with	0
the	0
family	1

yeah	1
and	0
so	0
it	1
was	0
in	0
my	1
case	1
i	1
i	0
just	1
uh	0
decided	1
that	1
as	0
long	1
as	0
my	1
kids	1
were	1
little	1
i	1
would	0
be	1
better	0
off	1
at	1
home	0
with	0
them	1
instead	0
of	1
driving	1
myself	0
crazy	1
trying	0
to	1
do	0
everything	1
at	0
once	1

um-hum	0
so	0
you	0
figure	1
one	1
of	0
these	0
days	0

well	1
actually	0
i've	1
found	0
out	0
that	0
i'm	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
go	1
back	0
to	1
being	0
an	0
engineer	1

you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
being	0
an	0
engineer	1
is	0
that	1
what	0
you	0
think	1

i'm	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
a	0
photographer	1
now	1

oh	1
okay	1
you've	1
found	1
something	0
else	1

i	0
have	1
i	0
have	0
branched	1
out	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
photographer	1
before	1
but	0
when	0
i	1
went	0
to	0
college	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
felt	0
like	0
i	1
couldn't	0
support	0
myself	0
if	0
i	0
decided	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
photographer	1
that	0
it	1
would	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
hobby	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
i'm	1
i'm	1
very	0
mechanical	1
and	0
mechanical	0
engineering	1
interested	0
me	1
so	0
i	0
did	0
that	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
did	1
that	0
for	0
six	1
years	0
and	1
then	0
i	1
stayed	0
home	1
with	1
my	0
son	1
and	0
did	0
nothing	1
and	0
found	1
out	0
that	0
i	0
was	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
great	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
i	1
was	0
bored	1
part	1
of	0
the	0
time	0
too	1
and	0
i	0
wanted	0
something	1
else	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	0
i	0
mean	0
you	0
figure	1
there's	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
more	0
to	1
life	1
than	0
sitting	1
here	0
playing	1
with	0
this	1
child	1

yeah	0
and	0
it['s]	1
it's	1
great	1
while	1
they're	0
really	0
little	1
but	0
as	1
they	0
get	1
older	1
and	0
they're	1
more	0
independent	1
and	1
there's	0
things	1
to	0
do	1
then	1
it's	1
good	1
for	0
them	1
to	1
go	0
to	0
different	1

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	0
it	1
he	0
goes	1
to	0
a	1
a	0
mother's	1
day	0
out	0
program	1
now	0
once	0
a	0
week	1
both	1
of	0
my	0
kids	0
do	1
and	0
so	0
they're	1
getting	1
they	1
they	1
get	0
the	0
socialization	1
with	0
other	0
kids	1
and	0
y[ou]	0
you	1
know	0
and	0
not	1
really	0
school	1
but	1
but	1
a	0
different	1
authority	0
than	0
mom	1
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
kind	0
of	0
learning	0
how	1
to	0
deal	0
with	0
society	1

and	1
and	0
they	1
they	1
need	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
be	0
able	1
to	1
relate	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
besides	1
the	0
same	1
person	1
every	1
day	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
they	0
do	1
too	0

and	0
i	1
need	0
it	0
for	0
the	0
break	1

yeah	1
well	0
that's	1
the	1
other	1
thing	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
talk	0
about	1
women	1
leaving	1
the	1
home	1
and	1
going	0
out	0
to	1
work	1
well	1
still	1
taking	1
care	0
of	1
the	0
children	1
is	1
a	0
very	1
important	1
job	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1
and	1
someone's	1
got	0
to	1
do	1
it	0
and	1
be	0
able	1
to	0
do	0
it	1
right	1
and	1
and	1
if	0
it's	0
not	1
if	1
it's	1
not	0
mom	1
then	1
then	0
dad	1
or	1
somebody's	1
got	0
to	1
move	1
in	0
there	1
and	0
do	1
the	0
job	1
because	1
the	1
kids	1
really	0
need	1
it	0

and	0
enjoy	1
it	0
that's	1
that's	1
the	0
whole	1
thing	0

yeah	1

i	1
think	0
that's	1
the	0
thing	1
that	1
were	0
going	0
to	0
see	1
well	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
biggest	1
thing	0
we're	0
going	0
to	1
see	1
coming	1
up	1
in	0
the	1
next	1
ten	1
year[s]	0
even	1
in	0
the	0
even	1
now	1
they're	0
starting	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
going	1
to	1
be	0
more	1
in	1
the	0
next	1
ten	1
to	0
fifteen	0
years	1
is	0
that	1
there's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	1
and	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
work	1
it	0
out	1
to	0
working	1
part	0
time	1

um-hum	0

because	0
if	0
if	1
i	0
if	0
i	0
had	1
been	0
allowed	0
to	0
work	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	0
thirty	1
hours	0
a	0
week	0
instead	1
of	0
fifty	1
hours	0
a	0
week	1
i	0
might	1
still	0
be	0
working	1
basically	1
full	1
time	1
or	0
part	1
time	0
if	0
there	1
was	0
if	1
there	1
had	0
been	0
some	1
way	0
to	0
work	1
it	0
out	1
because	1

yeah	1

because	1
i	0
liked	1
my	0
job	1
really	0
well	1

um-hum	0

but	0
i	1
was	0
just	0
pulled	1
in	0
so	1
many	0
different	0
directions	1
i	1
was	0
it	0
was	0
just	0
driving	0
me	0
crazy	1
and	0
now	1
with	0
the	0
photography	1
that's	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
working	1
that's	0
what	0
i'm	0
doing	1
is	0
working	0
part	1
time	1
because	0
i	0
can	0
put	0
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
situation	1
for	0
a	0
few	0
hours	1
in	0
the	0
uh	0
week	1
and	0
and	1
use	1
those	0
hours	1
to	0
do	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
thing	1
that	0
i'm	0
doing	0
is	0
taking	1
school	0
pictures	1
in	0
day	1
cares	1
and	0
in	1
mother's	0
day	0
out	1
programs	1
and	0
also	1
soccer	1
teams	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
different	1
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
so	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

um-hum	0

so	0
my	0
kids	1
can	0
be	1
in	1
day	1
care	0
for	1
a	0
few	1
hours	1
a	0
week	1
or	0
my	0
husband	1
if	0
it's	0
you	0
know	1
an[d]	0
an[d]	0
when	1
he's	0
at	0
home	1
can	0
take	1
care	1
of	0
them	0

yeah	0
so	0
jobs	1
have	0
to	0
i	0
guess	0
become	1
more	0
flexible	1

i	0
think	1
they're	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
and	0
not	1
and	0
not	0
just	0
for	0
mothers	1
for	0
fathers	1
as	1
well	1

yeah	1

it's	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
both	1

well	0
so	0
so	1
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
that	0
has	0
to	0
adapt	1
is	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
the	1
the	0
father's	1
attitudes	1
about	0
you	0
know	0
who[se]	1
whose	1
job	1
is	1
this	0

yeah	1

well	1
it['s]	0
it's	0
his	1
job	0
too	0
and	0
i	1
to	0
me	1
the	0
only	0
important	1
issue	1
is	0
the	0
children	1
because	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
housework	1
goes	1
you	0
know	1
men	1
can	0
do	0
housework	1
just	0
as	0
easily	1
as	0
women	1
and	0
thanks	1
to	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
new	0
inventions	1
housework	1
doesn't	0
take	0
as	0
much	0
time	1
as	0
it	0
used	1
to	0
so	1
uh	0

it's	0
just	0
convincing	1
your	0
husband	1
that's	1
important	1
or	0
that	1
that	1
that	0
it's	0
important	1
enough	0
for	0
him	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

yeah	1
to	0
yeah	1
to	0
m[e]	0

yeah	1
well	1

because	0
if	0
he	0
saw	1
mom	1
doing	1
only	1
that	1
you	0
know	0
all	1
the	0
time	0
he	1
was	0
growing	0
up	1
then	0
it's	0
hard	1
to	0
think	0
of	0
it	1
in	0
that	0
other	1
you	0
know	0
uh	1
that	0
i	1
should	0
do	1
it	0
or	0
tha[t]	1
or	0
just	0
to	0
think	1
about	1
doing	1
it	0
rather	1
than	0
having	1
someone	1
tell	1
him	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

and	0
you	1
you	0
you	1

yeah	1
you	0
talk	1
yeah	1

yeah	1

i	0
know	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
big	0
thing	1
in	0
our	0
house	1
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
was	0
that	1
if	0
i	0
wanted	1
my	0
husband	0
to	0
do	0
something	1
to	0
help	1
and	0
even	0
though	1
we	0
were	0
both	1
working	0
the	0
same	1
number	0
of	0
hours	1
and	0
and	0
doing	0
things	0
i	1
had	0
to	0
come	0
in	0
there	0
specifically	1
and	0
say	1
this	1
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
this	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

this	0
is	0
what	1
you	0
do	1
it	0
now	1
[laughter-no]	1

and	0
a	0
man	1
might	0
say	1
out	0
loud	1
well	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
understand	1
this	1
and	0
i	0
agree	1
but	0
still	1
he	0
was	0
raised	1
with	0
a	0
mom	1
taking	0
care	1
of	0
him	0
and	0

yes	1
and	1

and	0
and	0
that's	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
attitude	0
to	0
change	1

yeah	0
and	1
without	1
and	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
they	0
don't	0
look	1
at	0
things	1
most	1
men	0
don't	0
walk	1
into	0
the	0
kitchen	1
and	0
see	0
that	0
the	0
dishes	1
are	0
there	1
and	0
that	0
yes	1
you	0
probably	0
ought	0
to	0
unload	1
the	0
dishwasher	1
and	0
load	1
the	0
new	0
ones	0
in	1
and	0
run	1
it	0

um-hum	0

they	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
kind	0
of	0
scoot	1
it	0
on	0
another	0
spot	1
on	1
the	0
on	0
the	0
sink	1
and	1
and	0
put	0
the	0
next	0
plate	1
down	1
and	1
and	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
get	0
around	1
to	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
most	0
women	0
walk	1
in	0
and	0
and	0
and	1
with	0
oh	0
got	0
to	0
clean	1
all	0
this	0
up	1
got	0
to	0
get	1
this	1
out	1
and	0
this	0
in	1
and	0
this	1
you	1
know	0
taken	0
care	1
of	0
instead	1
of	0
having	0
someone	0
say	1
now	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
do[ne]	1
this	1
is	0
the	0
time	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
but	0

hm	0
uh	0
um-hum	1
yeah	1

and	0

but	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
is	0
is	1
how	1
it	0
was	0
drilled	1
into	0
you	0
when	0
you	0
were	0
a	0
kid	1
which	0
brings	0
us	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
idea	1
you	0
know	0
someone's	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
there	0
taking	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
kids	1
to	0
drill	1
in	0
these	1
you	0
know	0
drill	1
in	0
the	0
right	1
ideas	0
to	0
so	0
that	0
they	0
know	1
that	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
male	1
and	0
female	1
are	0
both	0
responsible	0
for	0
doing	1
this	0
and	0

that's	0
right	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

and	0
and	1
uh	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	1
going	0
to	0
show	1
up	0
a	0
lot	1
more	1
now	0
in	0
the	1
in	1
the	0
next	0
generation	0
of	1
of	0
boys	1
and	0
girls	1
it's	0
not	1
they're	1
not	0
going	1
to	0
the	0
boys	1
in	0
this	0
next	1
generation	0
are	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
told	1
as	0
much	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
because	0
mom	1
was	0
there	1
saying	0
that	0
dad	1
is	0
there	1
you	0
know	0
you	0

uh-huh	0


you	0
both	1
got	1
to	0
they	1
were	0
both	1
working	0
at	0
whatever	0
things	1
were	0
needed	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
they're	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

they're	1
going	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
the	0
kids	1
you	1
need	0
do	0
this	1
because	1
it	0
needs	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
not	0
because	1
it's	0
a	0
woman's	1
job	1
or	0
a	0
man's	1
job	0
but	0
because	1
it's	0
dirty	1
and	0
it	0
needs	1
to	0
be	0
cleaned	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
in	0
between	1
we	0
got	1
a	0
a	0
group	1
of	0
kids	0
a	0
generation	1
of	0
kids	0
who	1
didn't	1
learn	0
to	0
take	0
responsibility	1
because	1
mom	1
left	0
to	0
go	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
and	0
dad	1
didn't	0
move	1
in	0
to	0
fill	0
the	0
gap	1
and	0
so	0
basically	1
no	1
one	0
was	0
taking	0
the	0
responsibility	1

and	0
it's	0
gonna	1
it's	0
gonna	1
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
happened	1
in	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
cases	1

yeah	1
some	0
kids	0
are	0
really	1
having	0
it	0
if	0
they'd	0
been	1
in	0
day	0
care	0
the	0
entire	1
time	1
and	0
it	0
wasn't	1
yeah	1
the	0
ones	1
that	0
are	0
now	0
getting	1
to	0
be	0
teenagers	1
and	0
in	0
some	0
cases	1
young	0
college	1

um-hum	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
some	1
time	0
day	1
care	0
is	0
really	0
good	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
sometimes	1
it's	0
just	1
it's	0
baby	1
sitting	0

yeah	1

it's	0
someone	1
you	0
know	0
keeping	0
an	0
eye	1
on	0
the	0
kids	1
but	0
the	0
kids	0
are	0
basically	1
doing	0
what	0
they	0
want	1
and	0
not	1
really	1
having	0
any	1
relationship	1
with	0
the	0
adults	1
to	0
say	0
you	0
know	0
here's	1
what's	0
right	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
here's	1
what's	0
wrong	1
and	0
and	0
here's	1
what	0
we	0
expect	1
of	0
you	0

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
that	1
was	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
main	0
reasons	1
that	0
i	0
quit	1
was	0
because	0
i	0
wanted	1
my	1
kids	0
to	0
have	0
my	1
values	0
and	0
i	0
felt	1
like	0
when	0
they	0
were	0
young	1
that	0
was	1
the	0
time	1
to	0
instill	1
it	0
that	0
it	1
could	0
be	1
it	0
could	0
be	0
added	1
to	0
and	0
strengthened	1
as	0
they	0
grew	0
older	1
but	0
when	1
they	0
were	0
little	1
you	0
know	0
this	1

yeah	1

this	1
is	0
the	0
way	0
i	1
feel	0
about	1
this	0
and	0
this	1
is	0
the	0
way	1
because_1	1
i	0
it's	0
you	1
know	0
when	1
you	0
when	0
you	0
if	0
you	1
if	0
you	0
teach	1
them	0
when	0
they're	0
little	1
the	0
way	1
you	0
want	1
them	0
to	0
be	1
and	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
are	0
important	0
to	0
you	1
then	0
you	0
just	1
you	0
add	1
onto	0
it	0
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

um-hum	0

but	0
if	0
no	1
one	0
does	0
anything	1
when	0
they're	0
little	1
then	0
it's	0
twice	1
as	0
hard	1
as	0
i	0
think	1
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

yeah	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
saying	1
this	0
as	0
i'm	0
trying	1
to	0
keep	0
my	0
nine	0
month	0
old	1
from	0
trashing	1
something	0

yes	1
i	0
understand	1
i	1
i	0
wait	1
until	0
i	0
put	0
mine	0
in	0
bed	1
before	0
i	0
make	0
my	0
calls	1

yeah	0
well	0
she's	1
usually	1
in	0
bed	0
by	0
this	0
time	0
but	0
she's	0
staying	1
up	0
late	1
tonight	0
but	0
yeah	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
relationship	0
with	0
her	1
you	0
know	0
m[y]	1
my	1
dad	0
was	0
a	0
very	0
traditional	0
dad	1
and	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
child	1
i	1
didn't	0
really	0
know	1
my	0
dad	0
very	0
well	0
and	0
i	0
miss	1
that	0
and	0
i	1
want	1

that's	1
the	0
thing	1
if	0
woman's	0
role	1
like	0
we	0
said	0
if	0
women's	1
roles	1
change	0
drastically	1
men's	1
roles	0
will	0
too	1

yeah	0
the	0
men	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
convinced	1
of	0
that	1

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it's	0
for	0
the	0
better	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
women's	1
roles	0
i	0
think	0
are	0
almost	1
for	0
the	0
worse	1
because	0
we're	1
losing	1
out	0
on	0
some	0
things	1
going	0
back	0
to	0
work	1
but	1
i	0
think	1
if	0
we	0
can	1
if	0
we	0
can	0
expand	1
the	0
men's	0
roles	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	1
like	0
your	1
taking	0
care	0
of	0
your	0
child	1
and	0
your	0
dad	1
probably	0
didn't	0
very	1
often	0
i	0

no	1

i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
mine	1
almost	0
never	1
did	0

okay	1
um	0
well	0
the	1
first	1
thing	1
uh	0
what	1
do	0
you	1
think	0
you	1
would	0
offer	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
uh	0
information	1
about	1
selecting	1
a	1
school	1

well	1
first	1
i	1
think	1
they've	1
got	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
pretty	1
good	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
want	1
to	0
what	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
do	1

uh-huh	1

uh	1
once	1
they	1
have	1
that	1
then	0
they	1
can	1
start	1
looking	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
publications	1
that	1
give	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
information	1
about	1
schools	1
and	1
write	0
to	1
the	1
schools	1
themselves	1
and	0
start	1
finding	0
out	0
about	1
the	0
different	0
requirements	1
for	1
the	0
programs	1
and	1
what	0
kind	1
of	1
uh	0
of	1
job	1
assistance	1
and	0
all	1
that	1
other	0
kind	1
of	1
stuff	1
they	1
offer	1

yeah	1
uh	1
do	1
you	1
do	0
you	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
two	0
years	1
that	1
the	1
um	1
depending	1
upon	0
the	1
field	1
i	0
know	1
there	0
are	1
some	1
fields	1
which	0
a	1
person	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
the	0
school	1
that	1
school	1
all	1
four	1
years	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
fields	1
where	1
it's	1
really	1
not	1
necessary	1

yeah	1
a	1
lot	0
fields	1
are	1
most	1
of	1
your	1
liberal	1
arts	1
degrees	1
and	1
stuff	1
aren't	1
really	1
concerned	1
with	0
your	1
first	1
two	1
years	0
anyway	1
it's	1
it's	1
your	0
core	1
education	1
your	1
general	1
requi[rements]	1
general	1
education	1
requirements	1

uh-huh	1

um	0
if	1
you	1
know	1
if	1
they	0
want	1
to	0
get	1
a	1
liberal	1
arts	1
degree	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	1
advice	1
i'd	0
give	1
them	1
go	0
to	1
the	0
school	1
you'd	0
like	0
to	1
go	1
to	1

yeah	1

that's	0
what	1
i	1
did	1

yeah	1

i	1
didn't	0
care	0
about	0
the	0
program	1
or	1
anything	0
else	1
i	0
went	1
where	0
i	0
wanted	1
to	0
go	1

yeah	1
what	1
was	1
your	1
degree	1
in	1

uh	0
political	0
science	0

political	0
science	0
oh	0

kn[ow]	0
i	0
know	0
i'm	1
going	1
to	1
school	1
right	1
now	1
and	1
uh	0
i	1
have	0
a	1
friend	1

where	0

utd	1
university	0

that's	0
where	0
texas	1
instruments	1
is	0

yeah	0
right	0

um	0
something	0
that	1
i	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
i've	1
noticed	1
that	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
friend	1
i	0
think	1
if	1
you're	0
going	1
into	0
like	0
uh	1
law	1
or	1
medicine	1
a	0
very	1
particular	1
very	1
specific	1
field	1
even	1
even	1
engineering	1
you	1
can	0
get	1
you	1
can	0
meet	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
the	0
requirements	1
at	0
a	0
public	1
um	1
institution	1

sure	1

and	0
uh	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	0
cheaper	0

oh	1
yeah	0

my	1
parents	1
my	1
parents	0
made	0
a	0
mistake	1
in	1
uh	0
in	0
sending	1
my	0
sister	1
to	1
a	0
private	1
institution	1
for	0
the	0
first	1
two	0
years	1

um	0

and	1
she	1
found	0
out	1
after	1
that	0
she	0
said	1
you	1
know	0
my	0
parents	1
they	1
just	1
they	0
really	1
wasted	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
money	0
this	1
is	0
about	0
twenty	1
years	0
ago	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
uh	0
well	0
right	0
now	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
mean	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
selecting	1
selecting	1
a	1
school	1
i	1
i	1
i	1
feel	1
that	0
uh	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
depends	0
upon	0
the	1
major	1

yeah	0
it	0
does	0
um	0
i	1
didn't	0
know	0
what	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	1
do	1
after	1
i	1
got	1
my	0
my	1
degree	1

uh-huh	0

um	0
originally	1
i	1
had	1
planned	1
uh	0
undergrad	0
degree	0
in	1
political	0
science	1
and	0
then	1
a	1
master's	1
in	1
public	0
administration	1
and	1
i	0
went	1
ahead	1
and	0
pursued	1
that	0
i	1
i	1
got	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	1
thesis	1
and	0
decided	1
to	1
hell	1
with	0
it	1
i	1
didn't	0
want	1
it	0
um	1
and	0
from	1
that	1
point	1
i	0
went	0
to	0
law	1
school	1

um-hum	0

and	0
after	0
a	1
year	0
and	0
a	1
half	1
of	0
that	1
i	0
decided	1
i	0
didn't	0
want	0
that	0
either	1

okay	0

haven't	0
figured	0
out	0
what	1
i	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
when	0
i	0
grow	1
up	0

yeah	0

and	1
so	1
but	0
i	1
i	1
i	0
really	1
did	0
enjoy	0
the	1
law	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	1
that's	1
where	0
i	0
wanted	1
to	1
be	0
but	0
i	1
didn't	1
want	0
to	1
go	0
through	0
the	1
uh	0
the	0
hassle	1
that	0
the	0
law	1
schools	0
put	1
you	0
through	1
because	1
i	0
never	1
did	1
want	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
practicing	1
attorney	1
i	0
just	1
wanted	1
a	1
law	1
degree	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
i've	1
since	1
discovered	1
that	0
i	1
would	1
be	0
far	1
better	1
off	1
being	1
in	0
the	1
paralegal	1
field	1
because	1
that's	1
the	1
nuts	1
and	1
bolts	0
of	0
the	1
law	1
and	0
that's	0
what	0
i	0
like	1

yeah	0

and	1
you	1
don't	1
have	0
to	0
put	1
up	0
with	1
all	0
the	0
b	1
s	1
that	0
the	1
lawyers	1
have	1
to	1

right	0

so	1
that's	1
that's	1
what	1
i'm	1
pursuing	1
right	1
now	0

um	1

and	1
i'm	1
pretty	0
happy	1
with	0
it	0
so	1
far	1

yeah	0
yeah	0
i'm	0
i'm	0
pursuing	0
what	0
they	0
what's	0
what's	0
called	0
an	0
interdisciplinary	0
field	0
i'm	1
a	0
speech	1
therapy	1
major	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
fortunately	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
good	0
medical	1
background	1

yeah	0
that's	1

and	0

that's	1
probably	0
very	0
useful	1

yeah	1
it's	1
it's	0
actually	1
turning	0
out	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
more	1
useful	0
than	0
what	0
i	0
thought	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
also	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
languages	1
background	1
linguistics	1
and	1
some	1
psychology	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
it's	1
all	1
working	1
together	1

yeah	0

the	0
only	1
field	1
i'm	0
not	1
familiar	1
with	0
really	1
is	0
education	1
which	1
is	0
required	1
as	0
well	1
it	1
requires	0
about	0
four	1
or	0
five	0
different	1
fields	1
really	1

oh	0
good	0
grief	0

so	0
it's	0
a	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
i	1
thought	1
at	0
one	1
time	0
i	0
wanted	0
to	1
be	0
a	0
teacher	1
but	0
i	1

and	0
i	0

i	1
i	1
guess	1
uh	0
iraqi	1
now	0
is	0
the	0

i	0
know	0
it	0
but	0

law	1
law	1
was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
until	0
you	0
get	0
to	0
law	1
school	1

yeah	0

and	0
it	1

a	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
friend	1
she's	0
studying	1

going	0
into	0

if	1
if	0
you've	0
ever	1
seen	1
the	0
program	1
paper	1
chase	0
it's	0
very	1
much	0
like	0
that	1
except	0
worse	1

yeah	0

yeah	0
it's	0
i	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
probably	1
more	1
embarrassing	1
and	0
very	0
painful	1

it	0
is	0

i	0
i	0
see	0
i	0
see	0
that	0
happening	0

yeah	0
very	0
much	0
so	0

yeah	0
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
um	0

yeah	0

it	1
it	1
was	0
enjoyable	1
for	0
a	0
while	1
um	0
but	0
it's	0
such	1
a	0
grind	1

yeah	0

and	0
you	0
begin	0
to	0
wonder	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
if	0
i'm	0
not	0
i	0
mean	0
you	1
really	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
dead	1
set	1
on	0
being	1
a	0
lawyer	1
to	1
do	1
it	0
if	0

uh-huh	0

if	0
you	1
have	0
any	1
doubts	0
whatsoever	1
you	0
better	1
not	0
get	0
into	0
it	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0
i	1
wasted	0
a	1
year	1
and	0
a	1
half	0
of	0
awfully	1
hard	1
and	0
i	1
aged	0
ten	1
years	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
i	0
i	1
i	0
wouldn't	1
trade	0
the	0
experience	1
for	0
anything	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
never	1
hurts	0
to	0
have	1
some	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
grounding	1
in	0
law	1

yeah	0
i	1
i	0
went	1
to	0
a	0
language	1
school	0
and	1
and	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
it	1
was	0
a	0
an	0
i	0
guess	1
uh	0
united	1
states	0
institution	1
it	0
was	0
i	0
was	0
military	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
probably	0
the	0
biggest	0

what	0
branch	0
were	0
you	0
in	0

huh	0

what	0
branch	0
were	0
you	0
in	0

i	1
was	0
in	0
the	0
air	1
force	0

i	0
was	0
too	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
for	0
myself	0
i	0
mean	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
military	0
experience	0
was	0
fine	0
it	0
was	0
just	1
i	0
just	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
was	0
something	0
else	1
that	0
that	1
that	0
i	0
could	1
have	0
done	1
you	0
know	1
with	0

well	0
i	1
got	0
i	1
got	0
tired	1
of	0
the	0
service	0
after	0
a	0
while	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
terrific	1
job	1
really	1
enjoyed	0
it	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
well	0
what	0
was	0
your	0
job	0

uh	0
uh	0
command	0
post	0

uh	1
i	1
was	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
linguist	1

i	0
was	0
just	0
wondering	1
were	0
you	1
in	0
sac	1
by	0
any	0
chance	1

hum	0

were	0
you	0
in	0
sac	0

in	0
tac	0

sac	0

uh	0
no	0
i	0
wasn't	0

oh	0
okay	0
i	1
i	0
thought	1
maybe	0
you	0
might	1
have	0
had	0
some	0
experience	1
with	0
the	1
uh	0
r	0
c	0
one	1
thirty	0
fives	1

no	0
no	0
i	1
didn't	0
i	0
didn't	0
go	0
flight	1
crew	1
matter	1
of	0
fact	0
i	0
didn't	1
make	0
it	0
completely	0
through	1
that	1
through	0
that	0
field	1
i	0
was	0
i	0
was	0
in	0
intelligence	0
school	0
and	0
about	0
three	0
weeks	0
short	0

oh	0

i	1
didn't	0
make	1
[i]t	0
i	0
sort	0
of	0
washed	0
out	0

well	0
that's	0

that's	0

yeah	0
after	1
about	0
eighteen	1
months	0
of	0
talking	1
about	0
the	0
year	1
and	0
a	0
half	0
training	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
it's	0
something	1
you	0
know	0
i	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
think	1
that's	0
why	1
you	0
know	1
children	0
really	1
need	1
to	1
think	1
about	0
the	0
field	1
they're	0
going	0
to	0
going	0
into	1
and	0
i	0
mean	1
spend	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
serious	1
reading	1
before	1
they	0
i	1
mean	0
not	1
just	0
thinking	1
about	0
they	0

yeah	0

yeah	1

they	0
actually	1
should	1
do	1
some	0
reading	1

that's	0
right	0
and	1
it	1
and	0
if	0
it's	0
possible	1
even	1
get	1
some	0
experience	1
at	0
it	0
or	1
at	1
least	0
watch	1
some	0
people	1
do	1
it	0

and	0
they	0
should	0
study	1
it	1

yeah	0

i	0
i	0
i	1
i	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
to	0
be	0
said	1
for	0
kids	1
working	1
after	0
school	1

uh-huh	0

find	0
out	0
whether	0
just	0
how	0
much	0
of	0
a	0
people	0
person	0
they	0
are	0

that's	0
true	0
i	1
found	0
that	1
out	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
in	0
high	1
school	0
i	0
worked	0
at	0
mcdonald's	1

just	0
some	0
people	1
that	0
i	1
you	0
know	0

came	1
to	0
the	0
point	1
where	0
i	0
mean	1
and	1
oh	0
i	0
eventually	1
worked	0
in	0
a	0
lab	1
in	0
a	0
la[b]	0
as	0
a	0
lab	0
technician	1
and	0
i	0

much	0
better	1
in	0
research	1
and	0
books	1
and	0

the	0
paralegal	1
field	0
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0
that's	0
good	0
i	1
was	0
just	0
wondering	1
um	0
getting	1
back	0
to	0
the	0
school	1
thing	0
so	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	0
i	1
almost	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
was	0
some	0

i	1
don't	1
believe	1
that	1
we're	1

so	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
uh	1
the	1
recycling	1
programs	1
in	1
atlanta	1
julie	1

the	1
recycling	1
program	1
here	1
is	1
just	1
terrible	1
i	1
mean	1
it's	1
hard	1
to	1
find	1
places	1
to	1
go	1
i	1
mean	1
kroger	1
does	1
a	1
couple	1
things	1
they	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
they	0
do	1
they	1
do	1
newspapers	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
there's	0
there's	1
big	1
bins	1
out	1
there	0
i	1
don't	1
know	1
if	0
they	1
ever	1
get	1
i	1
i	1
really	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
details	0
are	0
there	1
should	1
be	0
someplace	0
where	0
you	0
could	0
call	1
and	0
find	0
out	1
as	0
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
i'm	0
pretty	1
sure	0
there's	0
a	0
place	1
you	0
can	0
call	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
the	0
closest	1
you	1
know	1
thing	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
i	1
think	0
there	1
should	0
be	0
some	0
kind	0
of	0
curbside	1
service	0

yeah	1

that's	0
the	0
only	0
way	1
i	1
could	0
really	1

the	1
one	1
in	1
florida	1
is	0
so	1
cool	1
because_1	0
they	1
pick	0
up	0
everything	1
they	0
pick	0
up	1
newspapers	1
and	0
uh	0
you	1
know	1
milk	1
jugs	1
and	1
aluminum	1
and	0
tin	1
cans	1
you	1
know	1
like	1
soup	1
comes	1
in	1
and	0
stuff	1

uh-huh	0

they	1
pick	0
up	1
everything	1

during	1
the	1
summers	1
like	1
the	0
around	1
where	0
i	1
live	1
the	1
uh	1
homeless	1
people	0
see[m]	0
i	0
mean	0
they	1
all	1
have	1
like	1
shopping	1
carts	1
and	1
stuff	0

um-hum	1

and	1
they'll	1
go	0
around	1
and	1
collect	1
cans	0
and	0
aluminum	1
stuff	0

um-hum	0

and	1
so	1
we	0
used	1
to	1
just	1
save	1
them_1	1
up	1
and	1
then	1
they'd	1
come	0
around	1
and	1
we'd	0
give	1
them_1	0
to	0
them	1

um-hum	1

but	1
when	0
during	0
the	0
winter	1
time	0
i	0
think	0
they	0
they	0
move	0
south	1
or	0
something	0
so	0

yeah	1

so	0
i	0
don't	0
do	1
that	0
anymore	0
and	0
the	1
the	0
recycling	1
at	0
georgia	0
tech	1
like	0
that	0
um	0
outside	1
the	0
uh	0
student	1
center	0
they	0
never	1
empty	1
those	0
things	0

um-hum	1

i	0
know	1
it	1
i	1
know	1
it	0
it	0

they	0
just	0
overflow	1

it	0
piles	1
up	1

so	1
what's	1
a	0
guy	0
to	1
do	0
you	1
know	1
i	1
asked	1
myself	0

i	1
just	0
don't	0
know	0

i	0
just	0
don't	0
know	0
and	0
now	1
they	0
have	0
like	1
bins	1
and	0
stuff	1
that	0
are	0
a	0
little	0
more	0
convenient	1
because_1	0

thought	1
about	0
that	0
that	0
is	1
very	1
inconvenient	1

i	0

kind	1
of	0
bad	1
about	1

it	0
is	1
though	1

it	0
comes	0
from	1
trees	1
how	0
can	1
it	0
be	0
bad	1

it	0
is	1
because_1	0
they	0

they	0
treat	1
it	0
with	0
chemicals	1
or	1
something	1
why	1
can't	0

down	1
i	0
don't	0
get	1
it	0

well	1
they	0
do	1
treat	0
paper	1
with	0
chemicals	1
like	1
yellow	1
paper	1
you	1
know	1
takes	1
something	0
like	1
twenty	1
times	0
as	0
long	1
to	0
decompose	1

yep	0

piece	0
of	0
yellow	1
paper	0
an	0
it	0
will	0
still	0
be	1
there	1
in	0
a	0
couple	0
of	1
weeks	1

really	1

yeah	1
it'll	0

huh	0

it'll	0
be	0
whole	1
you'll	1
be	0
able	0
to	0
read	1
off	0
of	0
it	0

i'm	0
gonna	1
switch	0
from	0
those	0
yellow	0
legal	1
pads	0
then	1

um	0

i'm	0
glad	1
you	0
told	1
me	0
that	0
because	0
i	0
use	1
those	0
at	0
work	1
where	1
i	0
work	1
and	0
uh	0
but	0
i	1
can	0
just	0
forget	1
that	0
from	0
now	0
on	1
i'm	0

hum	0

i'm	0
going	0
to	0
use	0
i'm	0
going	1
to	0
switch	0
to	0
the	0
white	1
ones	0

well	0
white	1
paper's	0
bad	0
too	1
they	0
they	1
treat	1
it	1
too	1

well	0
what	0
about	1
uh	0
papyrus	1
you	1
know	0
made	0
out	0
of	0
bam[boo]	1
you	1
know	0
bamboo	0
stuff	1
from	0
the	0
from	0
the	0
banks	1
of	0
the	0
nile	1

i'm	1
sure	1
that's	0
fine	0

i'm	1
sure	1

maybe	1
we	0
ought	0
to	0
just	0
start	1
carving	0
in	0
stone	1
again	0

you	0
think	0
so	1

maybe	1

tablets	1

yeah	1

i	0
think	1
we	0
should	0
just	0
abandon	1
the	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
written	1
word	1
altogether	1
no	1
what	1

you	0
think	1

i	0
don't	0
know	1
well	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
think	0
we've	0
kind	0
of	0
you	1
know	0
i	0

what	1
do	0
you	0
think	1

i	0
mean	0
everybody	1
[every]body	0
if	0
everybody	1
had	1
a	0
computer	1

kind	0
of	0
radical	1
i	0
know	1
but	0

we	0
would	0
no	1
longer	0
need	1
paper	1
at	0
all	1

that's	0
true	1

everyone	1
had	0
a	0
two-way	1
wrist	1
watch	0
tv's	0
on	0
their	0
wrist	1
like	0
uh	0
dick	1
tracy	0

i	1
would	0
love	1
that	0

[o]kay	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
they	1
said	1
i've	1
written	1
this	1
down	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
is	1
it	0
p[ossible]	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
it's	1
possible	1
to	1
have	1
honesty	1
in	1
government	1
or	0
an	1
honest	1
government	0

okay	1
you're	1
asking	1
what	1
my	1
opinion	1
about	1
whether	1
[laughter-it's]	1
[laughter-possible]	1
to	1
have	1
honesty	1
in	1
government	1

yeah	1

well	1
i	1
suspect	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
uh	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
probably	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
if	0
you	1
have	0
a	1
small	1
government	1
unit	1
where	1
everybody	1
knows	1
everybody	1

right	1
that's	1
a	1
good	1
point	1

but	0
um	0
other	1
than	1
that	1
i	1
think	1
maybe	1
it	0
just	1
depends	1
on	1
how	1
you	1
define	0
honesty	1

that's	1
an	0
int[eresting]	0
yeah	1
that's	0
interesting	1
i	1
had	1
read	1
something	1
one	1
time	1
and	0
it	0
was	1
just	1
applying	1
to	1
governments	1
in	0
general	1
it	0
was	1
written	1
many	1
years	1
ago	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
is	0
impossible	1
to	1
have	1
a	0
completely	1
honest	1
system	1
of	1
government	1
because	1
people	1
who	1
choose	1
government	1
for	1
their	0
positions	1
are	1
power	1
seekers	1
and	1
i	0
thought	0
that	1
was	0
interesting	1
it	1
wasn't	1
just	1
talking	1
about	1
our	1
government	0
it	0
was	0
just	0
government	1
in	0
general	1
from	0
times	0
past	1
you	0
know	0
on	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1

so	1
they're	1
saying	1
that	1
government	1
officials	1
would	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
power	1
seekers	1

right	0
and	0
that	1
would	1
be	0
a	1
next	1
question	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
many	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
are	0
in	1
there	0
for	0
pub[lic]	1
for	0
but	0
because	1
they	0
wanna	0
be	0
of	0
service	1
to	1
us	0
or	1
are	1
they	0
in	0
there	0
for	0
their	1
own	1
gains	1
and	0
personally	1
i	1
feel	1
it's	1
probably	1
there's	1
probably	1
some	1
of	1
each	1

right	1
yeah	1
but	1
i	0
think	1
maybe	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
them	0
um	1
say	1
the	0
more	1
honest	1
ones	1
who	0
are	1
still	1
looking	1
out	0
for	1
themselves	1
it	0
may	1
be	1
more	1
a	1
matter	1
of	0
not	1
what	1
can	1
i	1
steal	1
while	1
i'm	1
in	1
office	1
but	1
how	0
many	1
friends	1
can	1
i	1
make	1
while	1
i'm	1
in	0
office	1
and	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

and	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
good	1
a	1
name	1
can	1
i	1
make	1
for	0
myself	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
so	0
i	1
guess	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
like	1
anything	1
else	1
the	0

yeah	1

the	0
president	1
of	0
general	0
motors	1
probably	1
has	1
the	0
same	1

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
they	1
talked	1
uh	0
the	1
other	1
let's	1
see	1
third	1
question	0
was	1
how	1
m[uch]	0
how	1
much	0
self-serving	1
for	0
their	0
own	0
gains	1
do	1
you	0
think	1
goes	1
on	1
then	0
they	1
that's	1
hard	1
to	0
answ[er]	1
i'm	1
sure	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
but	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
you	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
in	0
business	1
i	0
think	1
that's	0
just	0
i	1
think	1
that's	1
very	1
normal	1
that	0
we	0
should	0
not	1
ex[pect]	0
i	1
mean	0
i	0

i	1
think	0
i'm	1
i	0
think	0
a	0
little	1
more	0
honesty	1
in	0
campaigns	1
would	0
be	1
more	1
to	0
the	1
point	1

i	0
think	1
we	0
put	0
too	0
much	1
on	0
politicians	1
we	1
expect	1
them_1	1
to	0
only	1
be	0
there	0
to	0
serve	1
us	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

if	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
getting	1
when	1
you	0
voted	1
uh	1

that's	1
a	0
problem	1
isn't	1
it	0

yeah	1

it's	0
interesting	1
because_1	0
i'm	0
taking	1
a	0
texas	0
government	1
class	0
right	0
now	1
and	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
i	1
always	0
reali[ze]	1
it's	1
so	0
easy	1
to	0
blame	1
them	1
to	0
b[lame]	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
times	0
i	0
think	1
it's	1
our	1
own	1
fault	1
they	0
lie	1
to	0
us	0
because	0
we	1
don't	0
wanna	0
hear	1
the	0
truth	1

yeah	1
they	0
say	1
you	1
get	1
the	1
government	1
you	1
deserve	1

and	0
if	0

if	1
they	1
tell	1
us	1
the	0
truth	1
we	1
don't	0
elect	1
them_1	0
and	0
especially	1
with	1
all	1
this	0
front	1
co[ver]	0
stuff	1
coming	1
up	0
here	1
lately	1
about	1
people's	1
past	1
and	1

um-hum	0

and	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
why	1
anybody	1
would	0
wanna	0
get	1
under	0
that	0
scrutiny	1
anymore	1

it's	0
hard	1
to	0
imagine	1

because	0
it's	0
i	1
think	1
it's	0
gotten	1
just	0
care[less]	1
well	1
we're	0

we're	0
not	1
talking	1
about	0
issues	1
we're	0
talking	1
about	1
somebody's	1
personal	1
life	1
and	0
and	1
we're	1
getting	0
away	1
from	1
what	0
we	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
looking	1
at	0

yeah	0
and	1
it	0
almost	1
seems	1
like	0
in	1
order	0
to	0
avoid	1
uh	0
some	0
of	0
this	0
scandal	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
to	0
have	1
the	0
kind	0
of	0
life	1
that	0
you	0
would	1
only	1
find	1
in	1
a	1
say	1
in	0
the	0
bobsy	1
twins	1
or	0
something	1
like	0
that	1

right	1

you	1
know	0
i	0
also	1
think	0
it'd	1
be	0
funny	1
if	0
we	1
could	0
kn[ow]	1
know	1
everything	1
about	1
the	0
people	1
that	0
were	1
in	1
there	0
and	0
threw	0
them_1	0
out	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
there	0
would	0
be	0
too	0
many	1
[laughter-left]	1

so	0
you're	0
taking	1
a	1
government	1
course	1

um-hum	0

at	1
what	1
at	0
the	1
university	1

uh	0
at	0
uh	0
it's	0
tcjc	1
tex[as]	0
tarrant	1
county	0
junior	1
college	0

oh	1

yeah	0

okay	0

and	1
it's	1
really	1
it's	1
really	0
enjoyable	1
i	0
like	1
it	0
and	0
they	0
also	1
you	1
know	0
ask	1
can	0
we	0
eliminate	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
we	0
could	0
make	0
laws	1
to	0
eliminate	1
all	0
corruption	1
and	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
we	0
can	0
make	1
laws	1
to	0
eliminate	1
anything	1
anyplace	1
totally	1

you	0
can	0
make	0
laws	1
against	1
corruption	0
[laughter-but]	0

yeah	0
but	0
that	1
doesn't	0
mean	1

[laughter-but]	0
[laughter-that]	1
[laughter-doesn't]	0
eliminate	1
it	0
does	1
it	0

i	1
don't	0
think	1
making	0
laws	1
will	0
stop	1
it	0
i	1
mean	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
many	0
laws	1
you'd	1
have	0
to	1
have	1
i	1
mean	1
you	1

well	1
they've	0
got	0
laws	1
against	0
canni[balism]	1
cannibalism	1
but	1
that	1
didn't	1
stop	1
that	1
guy	1
in	1
milwaukee	1
did	1
it	0

no	1
sure	0
didn't	1
did	1
it	0

so	0
no	1
i	0
think	1
you	0
can	0
legislate	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
there's	0
no	1
way	1
that	0
you'd	0
eliminated	0
all	1
by	0
legislating	1
and	0
we'd	1
end	1
up	0
with	0
so	1
many	0
more	0
laws	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
just	0
think	1
that's	0
human	1
nature	1
that	0
you're	0
gonna	1
have	0
corruption	1
in	0
government	1
in	1
business	1
personal	1
life	1
i	1
mean	0
you	1
know	0

actually	1
i	0
think	0
other	1
countries	1
may	0
have	0
it	0
worse	1
uh	0
the	1
japanese	1
government	0
is	1
always	1
having	1
a	0
some	1
kind	0
of	0
a	0
scandal	1

right	1

usually	1
involving	1
the	0
prime	0
minister	1
or	0
people	0
very	0
close	1
to	0
him	0
it's	0

yeah	0

so	0
uh	0

yeah	1
i	1
still	0
believe	1
i	0
get	1
very	0
fed	0
up	1
with	0
government	0
sometimes	1
but	1
when	0
i	0
think	1
about	0
where	1
i'd	0
wanna	0
go	1
you	1
know	0
this	0
is	0
still	1
the	0
best	1
or	0
i	1
can	0

yeah	1
i've	0
been	1
around	0
to	1
a	0
few	1
other	0
countries	1
and	0
i	0
uh	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
not	1
found	0
one	0
yet	1
that	0
i	0
would	0
rather	0
live	1
in	0
i	1
think	1
uh	0

yeah	1
yeah	1
at	1
it's	0
worst	1
i	0
think	1
we've	0
got	0
the	0
best	1

uh	1
well	0
what	1
would	1
you	1
say	1
your	0
opinion	1
is	0
on	1
gun	0
control	1

well	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
i've	1
i've	1
had	1
mixed	1
emotions	1
i	1
guess	1
when	1
i	1
listen	1
to	1
uh	1
the	0
radio	1
and	1
and	1
watch	1
tv	1
about	1
the	1
different	1
uh	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
happening	1
i	1
uh	1
i'm	1
against	1
it	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
token	1
um	1
i	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
purchased	1
a	1
gun	1
just	1
because	1
i	1
wanted	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
that	1

well	1

so	1
i	1
i	1
have	1
a	0
rifle	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
um	1
the	1
ammunition	1
is	0
probably	1
so	1
old	1
i'm	1
afraid	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
but	1
uh	1
i	0
bought	1
it	1
for	1
target	1
practicing	1
and	1
uh	1
and	1
also	1
because	0
i	0
wanted	1
a	0
weapon	1
uh	1
how	1
do	0
you	1
feel	1
about	1
it	1
