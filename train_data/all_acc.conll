well	0
michael	1
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0
about	0
um	0
funding	1
for	0
aids	0
research	1
do	0
you	0

well	1
um	0
uh	0
that's	0
something	1
i've	0
never	1
thought	1
a	0
lot	1
about	1

um-hum	0

um	0
i've	0
i	1
work	0
in	0
a	0
hospital	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
i've	0
worked	1
in	0
the	0
hospital	1
for	0
about	0
fifteen	1
years	1
and	0
i've	1
taken	0
care	0
of	0
a	0
few	1
aids	1
patients	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
when	0
they	0
asked	1
us	0
did	0
did	0
we	0
want	1
to	0
um	0
keep	1
it	0
the	0
same	1
or	0
uh	0
spend	1
more	0
or	0
spend	1
less	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
right	0
now	1
w[hat]	0
what	0
they're	0
spending	1
is	0
adequate	1
uh	0
my	0
for	0
my	0
personal	1
opinion	1
um	0
because_1	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
something	1
that's	0
gonna	0
take	1
them_1	0
a	0
while	1
to	0
come	0
up	1
with	0
a	0
uh	0
vaccine	1
for	0
i	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
don't	0
think	1
it's	0
gonna	0
be	0
that	0
easy	0
to	0
come	0
up	1
with	0
or	0

yeah	0

or	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
already	0
would	1
have	0
by	0
now	1
you	0
know	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
um	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
if	0
spending	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
money	1
would	0
really	1
make	0
any	0
difference	1
right	0
now	0
i	0
think	1
they're	0
doing	1
the	0
is	0
as	0
much	1
research	1
as	0
they	0
can	0
possibly	1
do	1
you	0
know	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
what	0
about	0
you	1

well	1
i	0
guess	1
i'm	0
not	1
too	1
aware	1
of	0
how	1
much	0
they're	0
spending	1
right	0
[laughter-now]	0
you	0
know	1

i'm	1
not	0
either	1
i'm	0

i'm	0
definitely	1
not	0
aware	1
of	0
how	0
much	1

yeah	1

uh	0
it's	0
something	0
i've	0
never	1
really	0
kept	0
up	1
with	0
at	0
all	1

uh-huh	0
yeah	0

um	0
i	0
don't	0
kn[ow]	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
uh	0
i	0

i	1
mean	0
i	0
go	0
ahead	1
um-hum	0

i	0
know	1
uh	0
i've	1
always	0
thought	1
more	0
about	0
the	0
disease	1
rather	0
than	0
the	0
research	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
i	0
mean	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

and	0
uh	0
that	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	1
um	0
if	0
if	0
we	0
were	0
talking	1
about	0
the	0
money	1
um	0
i'd	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
say	1
what	1
they're	0
spending	1
is	0
probably	0
enough	1
simply	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
much	0
about	1
it	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	0
can	0
see	1
that	0
research	1
is	0
needed	1
and	0
you	1
know	0

oh	0
yeah	1

definitely	1

i	0
think	0
so	1
i	0
think	0
so	1

i	0
mean	0
it's	0
becoming	1
a	0
major	0
problem	1

yeah	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
guess	0
the	0
area	0
that	0
i	1
think	0
more	0
about	1
is	0
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	1
them	0
focus	1
on	0
uh	0
preventing	1
it	0
uh	0
in	0
more	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

well	0
that's	0
true	1
that's	0
true	1
because	0
um	0
it's	0
a	0
such	1
an	0
easily	0
preventable	1
disease	0

right	1
and	0
i	0
i	1
feel	0
like	0
just	0
saying	1
uh	0
safe	1
sex	0
is	0
not	1
the	0
answer	1
it's	0

um	0

it's	0
it's	0
uh	0
abstinence	1
in	0
certain	0
cases	1
and	0

no	1
it's	0

it's	0
definitely	1
not	1

and	0

that's	0
true	1
that's	0
true	1

yeah	1

um	0

and	0
knowing	1
you	0
know	1

myself	1
um	0
um	0
i'm	0
just	0
recently	1
or	0
about	1
to	0
get	0
a	0
divorce	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
course	0
i'm	1
not	0
all	1
ready	1
to	0
just	0
run	0
out	1
there	0
and	0
start	0
dating	1
everybody	0
i	0
can	1
or	0
anything	1

yeah	1

but	1
it's	0
sort	0
of	0
scary	1
to	0
find	0
yourself	0
single	1
again	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
because	0
you	0
never	1
know	0
what's	0
gonna	0
happen	1
you	1
don't	0
know	0
who	1
you're	0
gonna	0
come	0
across	1
you	0
know	1
course	0

yeah	1

course	0
it's	0
it's	0
not	1
that	0
i'm	1
wanting	1
to	0
i'm	1
not	0
gonna	0
wanting	0
to	0
go	1
and	0
have	0
sex	1
with	0
[laughter-everybody]	0
i	0
see	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
it's	0
something	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
think	1
about	0
these	0
days	1

yeah	1

a	0
single	0
person	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
certainly	1
changed	0
my	1
attitude	1
about	0
that	1
in	0
a	0
hurry	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

and	0
um	0

i	1
think	0
for	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
it	0
has	1

certainly	1

so	1

yeah	1

so	0

but	0
um	0
uh	0
i	0
know	1
that	0
uh	0
in	0
some	0
of	1
these	0
larger	1
cities	1
they're	0
passing	1
out	0
free	1
syringes	1
and	0
all	0
of	0
that	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	0
to	0
prevent	1
you	1
know	0
so	0
that	0
uh	0
the	0
drug	1
addicts	0
won't	0
be	0
getting	0
dirty	0
needles	1
and	0
everything	1

uh-huh	0

drug	1
addicts	0

um-hum	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
that's	1
a	0
bad	0
idea	1

uh-huh	0

i	0
know	1
it	0
uh	0
sort	0
of	0
doesn't	1
address	0
the	0
problem	1
of	0
drug	1
addiction	0

yeah	1

it	0
just	0
sort	0
of	0
keeps	0
that	1
going	0

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
at	0
least	1
drug	1
addiction	0
can	0
be	0
treated	1
whereas	0
aids	1
so	0
far	1
cannot	1
be	0
you	0
know	0
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
that's	1
i'm	1
not	0
t[oo]	0
too	0
much	0
against	1
the	0
the	0
passing	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
free	1
syringes	1
myself	1

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0
about	0
that	1

well	1
yeah	1
boy	1
th[at's]	0
that's	1
a	0
hard	1
issue	1

it's	0
it	0
really	1
is	1
it	0

it	0
really	1
is	0

it	0
really	1
is	0
they	0
gave	1
us	0
a	0
hard	0
topic	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	1
i	0
i	0
definitely	1
think	1
that	0
it's	0
the	0
drug	1
problem	0
that	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
addressed	1
but	0
as	1
you	0
say	1
um	0
people	1
i	1
mean	0
in	0
the	0
meantime	1
well	1
someone	1
who's	0
not	1
ready	0
to	0
give	0
up	0
drugs	1
um	0
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

that's	0
true	1

that's	0
true	1

if	0
they're	0
per[petrating]	1
perpetrating	1
the	0
aids	1
problem	1
passing	1
that	1
on	0
to	0
each	0
other	1
then	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
consider	1
the	0
two	1
problems	1
drug	1
addiction	0
an	0
aids	1
aids	1
would	0
have	0
to	0
have	0
come	0
first	1
i	0
guess	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
something	1
to	0
uh	0
to	0
do	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	0

so	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
um	0
course	0
there's	1
so	1
many	0
things	1
in	0
the	0
world	1
where	0
if	0
you	0
solve	1
one	1
problem	0
you	0
may	1
be	0
creating	0
another	1
you	0
know	1

[laughter-yeah]	0

and	0
uh	0
so	0
i	0
guess	1
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
two	0
problems	1
and	0
see	0
which	0
is	0
worse	1
and	0
which	0
is	0
the	0
most	1
important	0
to	0
solve	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
don't	0
know	1

yeah	1

but	0
um	0
but	0
i've	0
never	1
looked	0
into	0
how	0
much	0
money	1
they're	0
spending	0
i	0
have	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
our	0
tax	1
money	0
goes	1
to	0
that	0

yeah	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
really	0
have	0
never	1
looked	0
into	0
it	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1

yeah	0
i	0
haven't	1
either	1
i've	0
heard	1
you	1
know	0
uh	0
different	1
voices	1
speaking	0
up	1
and	0
saying	1
we're	1
not	0
spending	0
enough	1
and	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

and	0
mostly	1
that's	0
what	0
i've	0
heard	1
so	0

right	1
sure	1

so	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0

yeah	1

and	0
yet	0
i	0
know	1
it's	0
um	0
it	0
sounds	1
like	0
big	0
money	0
to	0
me	1

yeah	1
i	0

but	1
it	0
probably	1
takes	1
a	0
lot	0

i	0
think	0
it	0
is	1
i	0

i	0
think	0
it	0
is	1

yeah	1
it	0
does	1
every	0
it	0

so	0

it	0
seems	1
to	0
take	0
more	0
than	0
uh	0
for	0
any	1
little	0
thing	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
seems	0
to	0
take	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
money	1
that	0
you	0
would	0
think	0
it	0
would	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

but	0
uh	0

did	0
you	1
have	0
any	0
fear	1
working	0
in	0
the	0
hospital	1
with	0
that	0

that's	0
one	1
thing	0
i've	0
never	1
really	0
feared	1

uh-huh	0

um	0
uh	0
i	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
my	0
family	1
you	0
know	1
they	1
fear	1
me	0
working	1
like	0
that	1
and	0
under	0
some	1
some	0
of	0
those	0
conditions	1
but	0
um	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
fear	0
it	0
at	0
all	1

um-hum	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
i	0
work	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
operating	1
room	0
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

and	1
um	0
and	0
of	0
course	1
when	0
we	0

okay	1
um	0
do	0
you	0
wanna	1
go	0
ahead	1
or	0

oh	0
sure	1
um	0
well	1
i	1
um	0
went	0
to	0
school	1
at	0
madison	1
for	0
two	0
years	0
and	0
they're	1
really	0
big	1
on	0
women's	1
rights	1
and	0
and	0
equal	1
treatment	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

and	0
so	1
i	0
i	0
seen	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
like	1
rallies	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
but	0
um	0

not	0
that	1
liberated	0
i	1
mean	0
my	1
mom's	0
kind	0
of	0
old	0
fashioned	1
you	1
know	0
so	0

um-hum	0

i	0
you	1
know	0
you	0
pick	1
up	0
some	0
traits	1
from	0
her	1
and	0
stuff	0
but	0
um	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
interesting	1
and	1
better	1
for	0
women	0
to	0
see	1
that	0
there's	0
more	1
more	1
of	0
them_1	0
doing	1
men's	1
fields	1
i	0
like	1
to	0
see	1
that	0
and	1
i	1
don't	0
like	0
to	0
see	0
women	1
you	1
know	0
like	1
waiting	1
on	0
men	0
hand	0
and	0
foot	1
but	1

right	1

but	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
i	1
believe	0
in	0
like	0
sharing	1
and	0
doing	1
things	0
for	0
each	0
other	1

i	1
do	0
too	1
i	0
like	1
the	0
idea	1
i	0
see	1
a	0
lot	0
more	1
um	0
my	0
children	1
i	0
have	0
five	1
children	0
and	0
they're	1
all	0
married	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
i	0
love	1
seeing	0
the	0
men	1
help	0
the	0
women	1
so	0
much	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
they	0
both	1
cooperate	1
together	1
oh	0
and	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
great	1

oh	0
me	1
too	1
i	0
hope	1
that	0
happens	1
to	0
me	1
someday	1
i	0
mean	1
i	0
i	1
don't	0
mind	0
doing	1
stuff	0
um	0

[laughter-righ[t]-]	1

um	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
boyfriend	1
and	0
like	0
i'll	1
make	0
him	0
dinner	1
and	0
stuff	0
but	0
you	1
know	0
and	0
he'll	0
help	1
me	0
do	1
the	0
dishes	1
i	0
don't	0
want	1
him	0
you	1
know	0
expect	1
to	0
have	0
to	0
clean	0
up	1
then	0
after	0

right	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
yeah	1

that's	1
right	1
that's	1
right	0

yeah	1
so	1

i've	0
always	1
taught	0
my	0
men	1
that	0
they	0
better	1
clean	0
up	1
with	0
their	0
women	1
and	0
help	1
them	0
if	0
they	0
did	0
that	1
you	1
know	0

right	1

and	0
they're	1
they're	0
good	1
about	0
it	0
but	0
it	0
is	1
neat	0
to	0
see	0
them	0
all	0
work	1
together	0
and	0
a	0
big	1
thing	0
though	0
i	1
see	0
all	1
that	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
women	0
getting	1
married	0
now	1
uh	0
go	0
ba[ck]	0
have	1
gone	0
back	0
to	0
you	0
know	1
they	0

um-hum	0

they	0
they	0
stay	1
at	0
work	1
or	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
work	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
they're	0
well	0
educated	1

um-hum	0

and	1
i	0
believe	1
we'll	0
see	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
ceo's	1
in	0
companies	1
they're	0
having	0
a	0
fit	1
about	0
how	0
little	1
there	0
are	0

oh	0

and	0
i	1
think	0
we'll	0
see	0
a	0
lot	0
more	1
don't	0
you	0
of	1
upper	0
management	1
than	0
we	0
do	0
now	1
even	0

oh	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0

right	1

i	0
think	1
it'll	0
escalate	1

yeah	1

and	0
uh	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
black	1
women	0
now	0
if	0
in	0
fact	0
i	0
work	1
at	0
a	0
high	1
school	0

um-hum	0

and	0
my	0
boss	1
is	0
a	0
black	1
woman	0
and	0
has	0
only	1
been	0
there	0
a	0
couple	0
months	1
and	0
already	0
promoted	1
and	0
she's	0
very	0
sharp	1
and	0
i	1
think	0
that	0
in	0
the	0
ethnic	1
thing	1
will	0
be	1
you	1
know	0
is	1
a	0
good	0
thing	0
now	1

oh	0
me	1
too	1

they're	1
moving	0
them	0
up	1
and	0
they're	0
sharp	1
and	0
they	0
so	0
you're	1
going	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
lo[t]	1
m[ore]	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
of	0
that	0
in	0
leadership	1
i	1
believe	0

yeah	1
i	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
that	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
um	0
really	1
neat	0
to	1
seeing	0
all	0
what	0
educated	1
minority	1
um	0
person	1
who	0
really	1
knows	0
what	0
they're	0
talking	1
about	0
and	0

um-hum	0
right	1

and	0
it's	0
just	0
too	1
bad	0
that	0
some	1
people	0
you	1
know	0
still	1
look	0
down	1
on	0
them_1	0
just	1
because	0
of	0
their	0
color	1
you	1
know	0
especially	1

right	1
that's	1
a	0
shame	0

especially	1
black	0
women	1

yes	1

so	1

yeah	0
but	0
they	1
wouldn't	0
know	1
what	0
they're	0
doing	1

right	1

but	0
i'm	1
not	0
big	1
on	0
subserving	1
as	0
[laughter-far]	1
[laughter-as]	0
to	0
the	0
men	1
at	0
all	1

um-hum	0

right	1

but	0
i	0
never	1
have	1
gone	0
along	0
with	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
even	1
far	1
back	0
but	0
i	1
was	0
brought	0
up	1
pretty	0
good	1
in	0
a	0
home	1
that	0
years	0
ago	1
my	0
mother	0
was	0
that	1
way	0
the	0
same	1
my	0
b[oys]	0
the	0
our	1
you	1
know	0
some	1
people	0
say	0
oh	0
the	0
boys	1
shouldn't	0
have	0
to	0
do	1
those	0
jobs	0
the	0
inside	1
jobs	1
but	0
we	1
never	0
were	0
taught	1
they	0
had	1
to	0
do	0
as	0
much	0
as	0
we	1
did	0
so	0
that	1
was	0
good	0

right	1
same	1
here	0
yeah	1

so	0
that's	1
i	1
think	0
that's	0
good	1
to	0
keep	1
the	0
equal	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
as	0
uh	0
not	0
nece[ssarily]	0
nec[essarily]	1
uh	0
necessarily	1
by	0
sex	1
type	0
thing	1
you	0
know	1

right	1
same	1
here	0

you	0
should	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
accomplish	1
as	0
much	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
the	0
uh	0
attitude	1
is	0
a	0
lot	1
better	0
towards	0
the	0
parents	1
raising	1
the	0
younger	0
ones	0
now	0

um-hum	0

you	0
see	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
of	1
the	0
mothers	1
and	0
all	0
saying	1
to	0
the	0
young	1
girls	0
you	1
know	0
you	1
can	0
do	0
it	0

yeah	1

if	0
he	1
can	0
do	0
it	0
you	1
can	0
do	0
it	0
type	0
thing	1

yeah	1

exactly	1
i	0
i	1
see	0
more	0
men	1
um	0
like	0
participating	1
in	0
like	0
the	0
family	1
things	0
with	0
children	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
helping	1
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
them_1	0
more	0
and	0
and	0
um	0
um	0
doing	1
the	0
jobs	0
equally	1
yeah	1
oh	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

right	1
what	1
about	0
politics	1
on	1
it	0

oh	0

do	0
you	0
think	1
the	0
political	1
scene	1

i'm	1
not	0
that	0
big	1
on	0
politics	1
i'm	0
not	1
that	0
educated	1
on	0
it	0
i'm	0

yeah	1

i'm	0

i'm	1
real	0
di[sgusted]	0
i'm	0
kind	1
of	0
disgusted	1
this	0
year	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
see	1
many	0
women	0
into	1
the	0
political	1
scene	0
and	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
we	0
should	1
have	0
more	0
political	1
leaders	1
in	0
the	0
women	1
than	0
we	0
do	1
up	0
for	0
and	0
even	0
for	0
president	1
and	0
vice	1
president	0
this	1
year	0
there's	0

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
that	1

there's	0
nobody	1
again	0
i	0
think	1
they're	0
all	1
scared	0
out	1
after	0
[laughter-tha[t]-]	0
after	1
um	0
oh	0
what	1
was	0
the	0
lady's	0
name	1
that	0
ran	1
a	0
couple	0
of	0
fitz[gerald]	1
i	1
forget	0
her	0
name	0
now	0

oh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0

but	0
you	0
know	1
who	0
i	0
mean	1

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
who	0
you're	0
talking	0
about	0

yeah	1
she	0
took	0
such	1
a	1
rough	0
go	1
of	0
it	0
and	0
they	0
ta[x]	0
their	0
tax	1
deal	1
and	0

yeah	1
at	0
least	1
she	0
was	0
strong	1
enough	0
to	0
like	0
try	1
it	0
and	0
you	1
know	0

right	1
right	1
but	0

so	0
that's	1
good	1

but	0
i	0
wish	1
they	0
would	0
get	1
some	0
more	1
on	0
tha[t]	0
i	0
really	1
was	0
disappointed	1
this	0
year	0
when	0
i	1
see	0
any	1
of	0
the	0
candidates	0
talking	1
that	0
they're	0
talking	1
about	0
um	0
they	1
i	1
didn't	0
see	0
any	1
of	0
the	0
women	1
in	0
there	0

um-hum	0

and	0
that	1
disappoints	1
me	0

oh	0

and	0
right	0
now	1
i	0
don't	0
think	0
we	0
have	1
too	0
many	0
tha[t]	0
uh	0
in	0
the	0
forefront	1
schroeder's	1
about	0
the	0
biggest	1
one	0
in	0
washington	1

um-hum	0

congress	1
woman	1
and	0
um	0
other	1
tha[n]	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
we	1
really	1

okay	1

okay	1
you	1
go	0
first	0

well	1

have	1
um	1
two	0
kids	1
i	0
have	0
one	0
seven	1
and	0
one	0
five	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
they're	1
in	0
a	0
public	0
school	1
here	0
in	0
tyler	1
and	0
um	0
i'm	0
happy	1
with	0
it	0

um-hum	0

i'm	0
happy	1
with	0
their	0
school	1
it's	0
great	1
good	0
teachers	1
good	0
curriculum	1
um	0
they	0
learn	0
a	0
lot	1
they	0
have	1
no	0
problems	1
um	0
but	0
i	0
do	1
live	0
in	0
the	0
better	1
and	0
well	1
in	0
the	0
best	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
city	1
though	0
i	0
live	1
in	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
real	1
richy	1
part	0
i	0
guess	1
i'm	1
not	0
but	0

but	0
everybody	0
around	1
me	0
is	1
and	1
um	0
but	1
the	0
i	0
have	0
friends	1
that	0
live	1
in	0
the	0
other	1
the	0
less	1
fortunate	1
or	0
whatever	0
you	0
wanna	0
call	1
it	0
part	0
of	0
town	1
and	0
their	1
schools	1
are	0
kind	0
of	0
rundown	1
and	0
um	0
older	1
and	0
they	1
don't	0
really	1
offer	1
as	0
much	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
as	0
uh	0
the	0
school	0
that	0
my	1
girls	0
are	0
in	1
i	0
don't	1
really	0
think	0
that's	1
fair	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

um	0
but	1
you	0
know	0
i'm	0
happy	1
with	0
what	1
they're	0
in	1
so	0
go	0
ahead	1

well	1
yeah	1
it	0
it's	0
it's	0
pretty	1
much	0
what	0
i	1
was	0
going	0
to	0
say	0
is	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
disparity	1
between	0
different	0
neighborhoods	1
and	0
what	0
sort	1
of	0
schools	1
go	0
in	1

um-hum	0

um	0
i	1
grew	0
up	0
in	0
new	0
york	1
and	1
um	0
the	0
place	1
or	0

wow	1

or	0
not	1
new	0
york	0
city	0
upstate	1
new	0
york	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	1
went	0
to	0
uh	0
the	0
city	1
of	0
rochester	1
school	1
district	0

um-hum	0

and	1
s[o]	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
my	0
friends	1
were	0
in	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
neighboring	1
suburbs	1
and	0
it	0
wasn't	1
we	0
weren't	1
too	1
far	0
removed	1
geographically	1
from	0
each	0
other	1
but	0
the	0
difference	1
in	0
schools	1
i	0
think	0
was	0
pretty	0
substantial	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
that	0
probably	1
would	0
have	0
been	0
better	1
if	0
is	0
if	0
the	0
entire	1
county	1
had	0
had	0
had	0
just	0
one	0
school	1
system	0

right	1

and	0
that	1
would	0
result	1
in	0
some	0
um	0
could	1
result	0
in	0
more	0
equitable	1
distribution	0
of	0
money	1
because	0
what	0
was	0
happening	1
was	0
you	1
know	0
all	0
the	0
very	0
rich	1
people	0
went	0
out	1
to	0
the	0
move	1
out	0
to	0
the	0
suburbs	1
and	0
the	0
city	1
had	1
a	0
very	1
low	0
tax	1
base	0
so	1
they	0
didn't	1
have	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
money	1
to	0
work	0
with	0

uh-huh	0

as	1
a	0
result	0
the	0
schools	1
were	0
rundown	1
there	0
wasn't	1
as	0
many	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
nice	1
supplies	1
in	0
science	1
class	1
that	0
we	0
would	0
have	1
liked	1
there	0
wasn't	1
as	0
many	1
advanced	0
placement	1
courses	1
uh	0
when	0
i	0
was	0
a	0
senior	1
as	0
some	1
other	0
schools	0
had	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
it	0
it	0
so	1
i	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
ways	1
to	0
to	0
to	0
help	1
schools	0
in	0
general	1
uh	0
and	0
get	1
them	0
all	1
to	0
a	0
minimum	0
level	1
of	0
of	0
of	0
competency	1
almost	1
would	0
be	1
to	0
expand	1
the	0
size	1
of	0
school	1
districts	1
so	0
you	1
get	1
a	0
wider	1
variety	1
of	0
people	1
and	0
the	0
the	0
problem	1
with	0
that	0
is	0
then	0
then	1
then	0
people	1
will	0
either	1
the	0
rich	1
people	0
will	0
either	0
pull	1
their	0
kids	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
public	1
school	0
and	0
put	0
them	0
in	0
private	1
schools	0
or	1
they'll	0
move	1
farther	1
away	1
to	1
get	0
better	0
schools	1
so	1

yeah	1

[laughter-right]	1

so	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
you	1
end	0
up	0
chasing	1
like	0
a	0
dog	1
chasing	0
its	0
own	0
tail	1
sort	0
of	0

also	1
um	0
the	0
the	0
family	1
environment	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
can	0
come	1
to	0
south	0
tyler	1
where	0
i	0

these	0
really	0
supportive	1
really	1

go	1
to	0
north	0
tyler	1
to	0
the	0
schools	1
and	0
the	0
parents	1

teacher's	1
name	0
is	0
you	1
know	0

whole	1
lot	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
it	0
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
their	0

mean	0
if	0
the	0
parents	1
aren't	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
willing	1
to	0
go	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
find	1
out	0
what	1
they're	0
learning	1
and	1
if	1
they're	1
learning	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
really	1
don't	0
have	1
much	1
of	0
a	1
chance	1
at	0

[laughter-you]	0
you	1

you	1
j[ust]	0
they	0

i'm	1
up	0
there	0
at	0
my	0
kid's	0
school	1
i	0
know	1
what	0
they're	0
learning	1
and	0
if	1
they're	0

i	0
call	1
and	0
find	0
out	1

fine	1
okay	1

i	0
i	0
know	1
kids	1
that	0
their	0
parents	1
could	0
really	0
give	0
a	0
rip	1
and	0
the	0
kids	1
are	0
not	0
motivated	0

right	0

right	0

they	0
have	0
no	1
motivation	0

eh	0
you	0
know	1
i'll	0
get	0
through	0
the	0
day	1
and	0
um	0
bring	0
homework	1
home	1
and	0
there's	1
nobody	0
to	0
to	0
sit	0
them	0
down	1
and	0
say	0
you're	1
going	0
to	0
do	1
this	0

right	0

um	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
they	0
they	0
take	1
a	0
notion	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
they	0
do	1
and	0
um	0
that	1
doesn't	0
work	0
either	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
guidance	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
there's	0
nothing	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
that	0
that	0
that	0
was	1

big	0
factor	1
for	0
me	0
i	0
ended	1
up	0
coming	0
out	1
of	0
of	0

anymore	0
it	0
just	0
gets	0

and	0
and	0
and	0
my	0
my	0
wife	1
you	1

uh	0
i've	1
just	0
got	0
wrapped	1
up	0
in	0
minutia	0
and	0

decided	1
not	0
to	0

your	1
budget	0
situation	0

well	1
actually	0

has	0
been	0
the	0
most	0
successful	1
uh	0
at	0
a	0
certain	1
point	0
in	0
life	0
and	1
my	1
husband	0
my	1
ex-husband	1
was	0
an	0
alcoholic	1
and	1
we	0
got	1
divorced	1

the	0
mid	0

three	0
teenagers	1

you	0
know	0
well	0
a[ctually]	0
a[ctually]	0
actually	1
that	1
kind	0
of	0
situation	0
is	0
just	0
a	0
wonderful	1
for	0
budgets	0
isn't	1
it	0

it	0
certainly	1
[laughter-is]	0

but	1
at	0
any	0
rate	0
what	1
happened	0
was	0
that	0
i	0
i	0
just	0
absolutely	1
put	0
away	0
all	1
the	0
credit	0
cards	0
i	0
didn't	0
rip	1

up	1
i	1
didn't	1
send	0
them_1	0
back	1
nothing	1
i	0
just	0
put	1
them	0
away	0
because	0
there	0
was	1
one	1
that	1
it	0
was	1
really	1
handy	1
to	0
have	1
if	0
i	0
absolutely	1
had	1
to	0
have	0
something	0
i	0
could	0
go	0
use	1
it	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
mostly	1
we	1
just	1
spent	0
cash	0
whatever	1
we	0
had	1
and	0
if	1
we	0
didn't	1
have	0
it	0
we	0
absolutely	1
didn't	0
spend	1
it	0
but	0
then	1
as	1
things	0

you	1
know	0
once	0
once	1
i	0
got	0
them	0
all	0
through	0
college	1

that's	0
kind	1
of	0
the	0
way	0

not	0
a	0
very	0
demanding	0
person	1
in	0
in	0
that	1
aspect	1
so	0

period	0

the	0
way	0

and	0
you	0

the	0
way	0

yeah	1
i	1
do	0
almost	0
all	1
my	0
purchasing	0
on	1
credit	0
cards	0

the	0
fact	1
that	0
i	0
have	0
enough	1
of	0
a	0
of	0
a	0
cushion	1
in	0
the	0
bank	1
so	0
that	0
when	0
they	0
come	1
i	0
can	0
pay	1
them	0
in	0
full	0

yeah	0
we're	1
we're	1
doing	0
that	0
we	1
have	0
you	0
know	1
uh	0
th[is]	0
this	1
is	0
our	0
our	0
our	0
big	1
uh	0

just	0
uh	0
we've	1
just	0
spent	0
spending	1
spending	1
spending	1

oh	0
my	1

i'm	0
envious	1
well	0
i	0

bu[t]	0
but	0
but	1
we	0
haven't	0
really	1
done	1
anything	0
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	0
because	0
we've	0
we've	0
had	0
two	1
kids	0
in	0
college	1
that	0
have	0
just	0
uh	0
graduated	1
in	0
the	0
past	0
year	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
we're	1
you	0
know	1
we	0
don't	0
have	1
that	0

it's	0
time	1
for	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
these	0
things	0
then	0
right	1

yeah	1
it's	0
uh	0
it's	0
about	1
time	1
that	0
we	0
did	0
that	0
but	0
the	0
the	0
the	0
terrible	1
part	0
about	0
it	0
i've	0
looked	0
at	0
it	0
all	1
and	0
it	0
all	0
looks	0
still	0
pretty	0
good	0
to	0
me	1
why	0
[laughter-why]	1
do	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
replace	1
it	0
but	0

but	0
but	0
[laughter-un[fortunately]-]	0
but	0
unfortunately	1
my	0
my	0
my	0
wife	1
leigh	1
feels	0
as	0
though	0
it's	0
it's	0
just	0
been	0
an	0
inappropriate	1
uh	0
thing	0
to	0
to	0
i	0
mean	0
that	0
rug	1
is	0
thirteen	1
years	0
old	0
why	0
not	1
replace	0
it	0
i	0
mean	0
i	0
i	1
say	0
it	0
might	0
go	0
for	0
another	1
thirteen	0
but	0
uh	0
too	0
late	1
we'll	0
never	1
find	0
that	1
out	0

this	0
is	0
so	0
funny	1
that's	1
wonderful	0
but	1
you're	0
lucky	1
to	0
have	1
her	0
because	0
if	0
you're	1
like	0
me	1
and	0
you	0
have	0
difficulty	0
spending	1
money	0
you	0
need	1
somebody	0
to	0
help	1
you	0
spend	0
it	0

and	0

i	1
mean	0
certain	1
things	0
really	1
do	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
you	0
think	1
they	0
should	0
be	0
or	0
not	1

you	0
know	0
i	1
i	1
i	1
don't	0
spend	0
that	0
much	0
money	0
i	0
just	0
uh	0
we	0
we	1
just	0
sort	0
of	0
have	0
had	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
too	1
many	0
obligations	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
sort	0
of	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
the	0
kids	1
when	0
they	0
were	0
in	0
school	1
and	0
they	0
they	1
got	0
through	0
school	1
and	0
that	1
was	0
the	0
major	0
you	1
know	0
decade	1
of	0
expenses	1
you	1
know	0
so	0
we	0
we	0
feel	1
as	0
uh	0
but	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
any	1
formal	1
budgeting	1
uh	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
i	0
we	0
just	0
apparently	1
have	0
been	0
very	1
fortunate	0
when	0
we	0
went	0
to	0
wanna	0
go	0
out	1
to	0
eat	0
we	0
go	0
out	0
to	0
eat	1
and	0
we	0
never	0
really	0
you	0
know	0
have	0
to	0
program	1
money	0
for	0
that	0
or	0
make	0
choices	1
you	0
know	1
but	0
uh	0
we	1
don't	1
have	1
that	0
uproarious	1
a	0
a	0
lifestyle	1
after	0
all	1
we're	0
we	0

okay	1
um	1
i	0
guess	1
we're	1
going	0
to	0
talk	1
describe	1
uh	0
job	1
benefits	1
and	0
so	0
what	1
do	0
you	1
think	0
uh	0
next	1
to	0
salary	1
do	0
you	0
rank	1
is	1
the	0
most	0
important	1
job	0
benefits	1

uh	0
i	1
would	0
say	1
the	0
medical	1
uh	0
group	1
insurance	1
uh	0
area	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
uh	0
covering	1
medical	0
costs	1
for	0
yourself	1
or	0
family	1
members	1

uh-huh	0

um-hum	0
well	0
um	0
does	0
your	0
company	1
have	0
good	0
benefits	1
in	0
that	0
in	0
that	0
regard	1

yeah	1
i	0
thin[k]	0
i	1
work	1
for	0
a	1
a	1
public	1
school	1
system	1
district	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	1
so	1
it's	1
different	1
than	0
a	0
company	1
where	0
most	0
companies	1
fund	1
almost	1
the	0
entire	0
thing	1
where	0
the	1
school	1
district	0
does	1
um	0
the	1
employee	1
must	0
pick	1
up	0
a	0
greater	1
figure	1
in	0
the	0
way	1
of	0
uh	0
costs	1

oh	0
yeah	1

but	0
i[t]	0
overall	1
um	0
i've	0
been	0
pleased	1
with	1
it	0
over	0
the	0
years	1

um-hum	0

i	0
think	1
the	1
biggest	1
frustration	1
is	0
because	1
of	0
the	0
cost	1
of	0
insurance	1
going	0
up	1
every	0
year	1
our	0
district	1
has	0
had	1
to	0
alter	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
change	1
companies	1
or	0
now	1
we're	0
on	0
a	0
managed	1
care	1
thing	0
which	0
has	0
stressed	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
out	1
although	1
it	0
has	0
not	1
disturbed	0
me	1
any	0

hm	0

i	1
see	0

how	0
about_1	0
yourself	1

uh	0
well	1
i'm	1
my	1
medical	0
coverage	0
is	1
with	0
an	0
hmo	1

uh-huh	0

um	0
so	1
that's	1
in	0
my	1
opinion	0
that's	0
gett[ing]	0
that's	0
bordering	1
on	0
a	0
health	1
clinic	0
but	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
good	1
way	0
to	0
maintain	1
costs	1
and	0
still	1
provide	0
a	0
good	1
amount	0
of	0
coverage	1

right	1
yeah	1
our	1

um	0

our	1
district	1
did	1
that	0
for	0
the	0
ninety	1
one	1
and	0
the	0
ninety	1
school	1
year	1
or	0
calendar	1
years	0
and	0
i	0
was	0
in	1
the	0
hmo	1
and	0
um	0
i	0
i	0
was	1
because	1
my	1
my	0
same	1
doctor	1
you	1
know	1
agreed	1
to	0
be	1
in	1
it	0
for	0
uh	0
they	1
usually	1
sign	1
a	0
contract	1
or	0
something	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	1
uh	0
i	0
did	1
have	0
surgery	1
last	0
summer	1
and	0
i	0
paid	1
ten	0
dollars	1
when	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
see	1
him	0
that	0
first	1
day	0
and	0
i've	0
never	1
seen	0
another	0
bill	1
so	0
i	0
i	0
have	1
to	0
say	1
it	0
really	0
works	1
but	0

right	1

but	0
again	1
i	1
was	0
fortunate	1
because	0
my	1
doctor	0
agreed	1
to	0
be	0
in	1
it	0
uh	0
if	0
you've	0
been	0
going	1
to	0
a	0
doctor	1
for	0
you	1
know	0
ten	0
years	1
or	0
something	1
and	0
he	1
elects	0
not	1
to	0
join	1
it	0
can	1
be	0
very	0
stressful	1
for	0
you	0
know	1
those	0
people	1

yes	1

that's	0
right	1
yeah	0
i'm	0
i'm	0
fairly	0
young	1
myself	1
i've	0
only	1
been	0
when	0
i	0
first	1
started	0
working	1
which	0
three	1
years	0
ago	0
is	0
when	0
i	0
first	1
got	0
into	0
full	1
time	0
employment	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
at	0
that	1
time	0
i	0
immediately	1
joined	0
the	0
hmo	1
and	0
i	0
never	1
really	0
so	0
the	0
only	0
doctor	1
i	0
i've	0
kind	0
of	0
consistently	1
had	1
has	0
been	1
through	0
the	0
hmo	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
for	0
me	1
it's	0
worked	1
out	0
real	0
good	1

yeah	1

right	1
but	0
if	0
you	1
you	1
know	0
have	0
a	0
family	1
and	0
and	0
um	0
everybody's	1
gone	1
to	0
different	1
doctors	1
uh	0
it	0
is	1
hard	0
to	0
give	0
up	1
somebody	0
who	0
you	1
feel	1
knows	1
you	0
and	0
your	0
body	1
and	0
your	0
just	1
has	0
you	1
know	0
all	1
the	0
medical	0
history	1
and	0
you	0
feel	0
comfortable	1
with	0
it	0
i	0

um-hum	1

i	0
i'm	0
sure	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
very	1
stressful	0
and	0
my	0
husband	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
just	0
elected	1
that	0
if	0
that	0
happens	1
i	1
will	0
go	0
and	0
just	0
pay	1
you	0
can	1
continue	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
your	0
own	1
doctor	1

hm	1

but	1
your	0
benefits	1
are	0
not	1
as	0
you	1
know	0
good	1
so	0
uh	0

um-hum	0
yeah	1
um	0
like	0
you	0
you	0
mentioned	1
you	0
work	0
for	0
a	0
school	1
system	0
i	1
work	0
for	0
uh	0
georgia	1
tech	1
in	0
the	0
research	1
branch	1

oh	0
all	1
right	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
another	1
one	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
i	1
rank	0
up	0
there	0
high	1
is	0
the	1
uh	0
kind	0
of	0
job	1
flexibility	0
and	0
time	1
off	1
um	0
i	1
enjoy	0
as	0
a	0
as	0
a	0
benefit	1

i	1
do	1
too	1
are	0
you	0
talking	1
about	0
like	0
spring	1
break	1
and	0

right	1
yeah	1

right	1

yeah	1
getting	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
breaks	1
between	0
quarters	1
and	0
that	1
and	0
having	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
vacation	1

right	1

it	0
it	0
really	1
um	0
i	1
don't	1
think	1
most	1
of	0
our	0
teachers	1
now	0
i'm	1
not	1
a	0
teacher	1
i	1
am	0
the	0
a	0
secretarial	1
executive	1
assistant	1
but	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
the	0
teachers	1
could	0
stand	0
the	0
stress	1
[laughter-all]	0
all	1
year	0
long	1
frankly	1
it	1

um-hum	0

it	1
is	0
just	1
texas	1
has	0
really	1
um	0
you	1
know	1
they	1
want	1
everybody	1
educated	1
no	0
matter	0
what	1
it's	0
costs	1
uh	0
and	0
it	0
it	1
would	1
be	0
just	1
we	0
all	1
look	0
forward	1
to	0
like	1
in	0
two	0
weeks	1
we	0
have	0
spring	1
break	1
and	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
who	0
looks	0
forward	1
to	0
it	0
more	1
the	0
students	1
or	0
the	0
or	0
the	0
teachers	1
and	0
the	0
[laughter-staff]	1

um-hum	0

right	1

what	1
do	0
you	0
do	1
there	0

well	1
um	0
i'm	0
not	1
actually	0
on	0
the	0
teaching	1
faculty	0
but	0
we	1
have	0
a	0
large	0
research	1
organization	0
associated	1
with	0
the	0
university	1
and	0
that's	1
who	0
i	0
work	1
with	0

okay	1

um	0
and	0
we're	0
given	1
you	1
know	0
a	0
good	1
bit	0
of	0
flexibility	1
in	0
what	0
we	0
do	1
we	0
can	0
kind	0
of	0
pursue	1
our	0
own	0
interests	1
in	0
terms	1
of	0
the	0
research	1
areas	0
that	0
we	0
study	1

well	0
that's	1
good	0
yeah	1
i	1
would	0
think	1
that	0
that	0
type	1
of	0
employment	1
you're	0
you're	0
one	1
day	0
you	0
might	0
be	0
really	1
tuned	0
in	0
and	0
the	0
next	0
day	1
oh	0
a	0
little	0
lukewarm	1
or	0
something	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
good	1
that	0
they	0
allow	1
you	0
that	1

right	1

it	0
um	0
a[s]	0
i	0
say	1
the	0
schools	1
now	0
we	1
do	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
day	1
but	0
we	0
do	1
get	0
many	1
days	0
off	1
and	0
um	0
we	0
all	0
look	0
forward	1
to	0
it	0
that's	1

um-hum	0

that's	1
only	0
reason	0
i	0
work	1
there	0
is	0
that	0
my	0
children	1
now	0
have	0
graduated	1
and	1
graduated	0
from	0
college	1
but	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
i	0
worked	1
there	0
because	1
my	1
hours	1
and	0
days	1
were	0
the	0
same	0
as	0
theirs	1

oh	0
yeah	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
i've	1
just	0
continued	1
to	0
uh	0
stay	1
there	0
so	0

are	0
there	0
are	0
there	0
any	1
things	0
that	0
that	0
you'd	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
changed	1
in	0
terms	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
benef[its]	1

is	1
uh	1
kind	0
of	1
fun	1
it's	0
best	1
done	1
when	1
you	0
have	1
leisure	1
time	1
and	0
i	1
had	1
more	1
of	0
that	0
in	1
my	0
childhood	1
days	1
than	0
i	1
have	1
now	1
and	1
i	0
grew	1
up	1
in	0
an	1
area	1
that	0
uh	0
it	0
was	0
just	1
a	0
few	1
feet	1
from	0
a	1
rather	1
large	1
lake	1
and	0
a	1
few	1
more	0
miles	1
from	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
even	0
larger	1
lake	0
and	0
we	0
had	1
a	1
variety	1
of	0
boats	1
at	1
our	0
disposal	1
um	0
i	0
worked	1
for	0
a	0
camp	1
for	0
a	0
number	1
of	1
years	1
my	0
father	1
was	1
on	0
staff	1
there	1
and	0
we	0
had	1
every	0
kind	1
of	0
things	1
from	0
canoes	1
to	0
paddle	1
boats	0
sailboats	1
um	0
speedboats	1
uh	1
you	0
name	1
it	1
they	0
had	1
it	0
and	0
we	0
did	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
watering	1
water	1
sports	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
uh	1
the	0
thing	1
i	0
liked	1
the	1
best	1
was	0
uh	0
we	0
spent	1
about	0
a	0
summer	1
couple	1
of	0
guys	1
uh	0
restored	0
an	0
old	1
wooden	1
boat	1
that	0
was	0
built	1
back	1
in	0
the	0
mid	0
thirties	1
and	0
got	1
a	0
new	1
canvas	1
sail	1
for	0
it	0
and	0
had	0
a	0
real	1
hu[ge]	0
big	1
old	0
four	1
foot	0
center	1
board	0
that	0
went	0
down	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
to	0
keep	0
you	0
upright	1
when	0
the	0
waves	1
or	0
the	0
wind	1
came	0
from	0
the	0
side	1
and	0
we	0
got	0
that	0
thing	1
in	0
the	0
water	1
and	0
had	1
a	0
real	0
good	0
time	1
with	0
it	0
if	0
you	1
ever	0
got	1
it	0
dumped	1
over	0
though	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
mess	1
to	0
get	0
back	0
up	1
it	0
wasn't	0
like	1
the	0
newer	0
ones	0
that	0
have	0
nice	1
chambers	1
that	0
keep	1
it	0
afloat	1
or	0
keep	0
it	0
uh	0
upright	1
again	1
this	0
one	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
work	1
with	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-get]	0
[laughter-out]	0
[laughter-of]	0
the	0
water	1
again	0
and	0
get	0
it	0
upright	1
and	0
uh	0
sailing	1
was	0
was	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
to	0
learn	1
the	0
maneuvers	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
make	1
to	0
work	1
your	0
way	0
down	0
a	0
lake	1
or	0
work	0
back	1
up	0
against	0
the	0
the	0
wind	1
as	0
it	0
were	0
attacking	1
back	0
and	0
forth	1
and	0
um	0
more	1
than	0
once	1
we'd	0
get	0
out	0
there	1
on	0
a	0
really	0
stormy	1
day	1
and	0
uh	0
the	0
storm	1
or	0
the	0
wind	1
was	0
due	1
to	0
the	0
s[torm]	0
front	1
blowing	0
in	1
and	0
soon	1
as	0
the	0
front	1
came	0
over	1
it	0
was	0
calm	1
so	0
you're	0
out	1
in	0
the	0
middle	0
of	0
nowhere	1
with	0
a	0
paddle	1
[laughter-and]	0
[laughter-you]	0
paddle	1
your	0
way	0
back	0
in	1
and	0
hope	1
it	0
doesn't	0
start	1
raining	1
on	0
you	0
right	0
away	1
and	0
that	0
didn't	0
always	0
work	1
we	0
often	1
times	1
got	0
wet	1
but	1
um	0
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
nice	1
nice	0
hobby	1
to	0
have	1
and	0
nowadays	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
could	0
afford	1
the	0
boat	1
or	0
the	0
time	1
nor	0
do	0
we	0
live	0
that	1
close	0
to	0
a	0
lake	1
anymore	0
so	0
things	0
change	1
i	0
guess	1
what	0
are	0
your	1
memories	1
of	0
boating	1
or	0
current	1

um	1
about	1
the	0
only	1
memories	1
that	0
i	1
have	1
of	0
boating	1
um	1
my	0
husband's	1
family	1
had	1
a	0
a	0
motor	1
boat	1
um	0
when	1
we	0
got	0
engaged	1
and	0
they	0
took	1
us	0
out	0
on	0
the	0
lake	1
several	0
times	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
really	1
did	0
enjoy	1
that	1
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
that	1
i	0
ever	0
learned	1
to	0
drive	1
it	0
or	0
anything	1
but	0
um	0
we	0
did	0
some	0
water	1
skiing	0
of	0
course	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
driving	1
around	0
the	0
lake	1
in	0
the	0
boat	1
and	0
and	0
just	1
the	0
basic	1
safety	1
rules	0
and	0
things	1
i	0
found	0
real	1
interesting	1
um	0
you	0
know	1
they	0
you	0
they	0
just	1
didn't	0
patrol	1
you	0
like	1
they	0
did	1
with	0
the	0
automobile	1
or	0
whatever	0
the	0
the	0
laws	1
were	0
there	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
didn't	1
obey	1
them_1	0
uh	1
you	0
know	1
[laughter-there]	0
were	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
accidents	1
i	0
guess	0

right	1

it's	0
true	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
found	0
the	0
motor	1
boating	1
was	1
real	0
fun	1

yeah	0
i	1
remember	0
learning	1
how	0
to	0
ski	1
oh	0
i	0
guess	0
i	0
was	0
seven	1
or	0
eight	1
years	0
old	1
and	0
the	0
lake	1
that	0
we	0
learned	1
on	0
was	0
the	0
smaller	1
of	0
the	0
two	1
that	0
we	0
had	0
access	1
to	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
maybe	0
fifteen	1
twenty	0
acres	1
and	1
it	0
was	0
uh	0
it	0
had	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
um	0
turtles	1
in	0
it	0
and	0
i	1
got	0
all	0
ready	1
to	0
go	0
and	0
i	0
was	0
down	1
in	0
the	0
water	1
and	0
and	0
set	1
to	0
go	1
and	0
a	0
and	0
just	1
as	0
that	1
boat	1
took	0
off	1
a	0
turtle	1
bit	1
me	0
in	0
the	0
middle	0
of	0
the	0
back	1
it	0

oh	0

it	0
didn't	0
hurt	0
too	0
much	1
but	0
it	0
bit	0
enough	1
to	0
where	1
i	0
let	0
go	1
and	0
the	0
boat	1
went	0
off	0
without	1
me	0
and	0
i	0
reached	0
back	1
there	0
and	0
sn[atched]	0
pushed	1
him	0
away	1
and	0
got	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
water	1
a	0
a	0
while	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
it	0
didn't	1
even	0
leave	0
a	0
mark	1
it	0
was	0
just	0
a	0
little	0
nibble	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
told	1
everybody	0
what	0
happened	1
and	0
they	0
go	0
oh	0
yeah	1
sure	1
you	0
know	0
and	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
get	1
back	0
down	0
in	0
there	1
and	0
and	0
i'll	1
be	1
if	0
he	1
didn't	0
do	0
it	0
again	1
this	0
time	1
a	0
little	0
earlier	1
and	0
and	0
i	1
had	0
let	0
go	0
before	1
then	0
and	0
before	1
they	0
took	0
off	1
this	0
time	1
and	0
and	0
swatted	1
him	0
away	1
so	0
i	0
moved	0
over	1
a	0
a	0
few	0
feet	1
in	0
the	0
water	1
and	0
got	1
out	0
of	0
his	1
little	0
realm	1
where	0
he	0
was	0
living	1
underneath	0
the	0
dock	1
and	0
uh	0
managed	1
to	0
get	0
up	1
didn't	0
go	1
very	0
far	1
but	0
i	0
got	0
up	1
and	0
it	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
nice	1
uh	0
nice	0
long	1
skiing	1
career	1
but	0
now	1
i've	0
gotten	0
to	0
where	0
skiing	1
is	0
just	0
kind	0
of	0
wears	1
me	0
out	1
more	0
than	0
it	0
does	1
thrill	1
me	0
i've	0
i've	0
uh	0
done	1
about	0
all	0
i	0
dare	1
do	0
on	0
skis	1
you	0
know	0
skiing	1
on	0
one	1
and	0
jumping	1
around	0
here	1
and	0
there	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
i	0
know	1
how	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
injured	1
doing	0
much	0
more	1
than	0
that	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
can't	1
risk	1
it	0
right	0
now	1
being	0
a	0
head	1
of	0
the	0
family	1
and	0
the	0
breadwinner	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
just	0
uh	0
can't	0
take	0
the	0
risk	1
i	0
did	1
as	0
a	0
dumb	0
teenager	1
i	0
guess	1
so	0
life	1
changes	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
in	0
that	1
respect	1
i'd	0
kind	0
of	0
like	1
someday	1
to	0
maybe	1
end	0
up	0
on	0
a	0
pair	1
of	0
skis	1
that	0
that	0
doesn't	0
have	1
a	0
uh	0
well	0
what	0
they	0
call	1
trick	1
skis	0
they'll	0
allow	1
you	0
to	0
ski	0
backwards	1
i	0
haven't	0
cra[ft]	0
managed	1
to	0
get	0
a	1
hold	1
on	0
that	1
uh	0
craft	1
yet	1
but	0
uh	0

that	0
sounds	1
like	0
a	0
real	0
challenge	1

yeah	0
it	0
it'd	0
be	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
i	0
hadn't	0
quite	0
figured	0
out	1
i	0
don't	0
have	1
anybody	0
to	0
teach	1
me	1
either	0
that's	0
another	1
little	0
thing	1
you	0
need	1
somebody	0
to	0
kind	1
of	0
tell	0
you	0
what	1
to	0
do	1
but	0
just	1
from	0
what	0
i've	0
seen	1
you	0
just	0
kind	0
of	0
w[ork]	0
work	1
your	0
way	0
up	1
to	0
it	1
and	0
turn	0
around	1
real	0
quick	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0
grab	1
the	0
rope	1
behind	1
you	0
and	0
then	0
just	0
l[et]	0
let	0
go	1
real	0
quick	1
and	0
let	0
it	0
whip	1
you	0
around	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
maybe	0
someday	1
i'll	1
i'll	0
get	0
back	1
to	0
that	1
as	0
after	0
the	0
kids	1
are	0
up	0
and	0
grown	1
and	0
the	0
monies	1
are	0
there	1
to	0
get	0

are	0
fixed	1
during	0
the	0
month	1
you	0

that	0
come	0
every	1
every	0
month	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

those	0
into	0
uh	0
into	1
a	0
spread	1
sheet	0
and	0
uh	0
what's	0
ever	1
left	1

that's	1
basically	0
what	0
we	0
do	1
um	0
about	1
every	1
every	0
three	0
months	1
or	0
so	1
we	0
reevaluate	1
our	0

that	0
works	1
out	0
nice	0
because	0
we	0

that	1
does	0
help	1

yeah	0

helps	0
a	0
lot	1
and	0
then	1
um	0
we	1
don't	0
have	0
a	0
lot	1
ex[tra]	0
extra	1
for	1
extra	1
spending	1

pretty	0
well	1
earmarked	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
all	0
allocated	1
out	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

yeah	1
ev[ery]	0
every	1
penny	1
is	1
earmarked	1
but	1
um	0
it	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
that	0
that	1
works	0
the	0
best	1
and	0
and	0
so	1
if	0
we	1
can	0
just	0
divide	1
them	1
up	0
all	1
the	1
major	1
bills	0
up	0
in	0
fact	1
we	0
found	0
it	0
easier	1
to	1
divide	0
the	0
major	1
bills	0
up	1
you	1
know	0
cut	1
the	0
house	1
payment	0
in	0
half	1
and	0
cut	1
the	0
loan	1
payment	0
in	0
half	1
and	0
and	1
divide	1
those	0
up	0
between	1
all	0
um-hum	0

all	1
the	0
checks	1
yeah	1

and	0
so	1
we	0
are	0
not	1
taking	0
a	0
huge	1
sum	0
out	0
out	0
of	0
one	1
and	0
then	1
the	0
next	1
pay	0
check	0
we're	0
real	1
short	1
or	0

right	1
yeah	1
we	1
found	0
that	0
um	0
it's	0
definitely	1
helped	0
uh	0
get	1
a	0
handle	1
on	0
kind	1
of	0
the	0
unnecessary	1
expenses	1

that's	1
true	1

we	1
were	0
before	1
we	0
started	0
doing	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
thing	1
we	0
were	0
um	0
spending	1
uh	0
money	1
for	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
probably	1
tended	0
to	0
eat	1
out	0
a	0
bit	0
more	1
than	0
the	0
than	1
we	0
should	1
have	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
easy	1
to	0
uh	0
let	1
things	0
get	0
out	0
of	0
hand	1
we	1
thought	0
it	0
uh	0
thought	1
it	0
to	0
be	0
really	0
helpful	1
we've	0
gotten	1
some	0
of	0
our	0
loans	1
paid	0
off	0
early	1
because	1
of	0
this	0
and	0
and	0
stuff	1
like	0
that	1
so	0

yeah	0

so	0

well	1
it	0
helps	1
you	0
to	0
focus	1
where	1
your	0
money	0
goes	1

yeah	0

and	1
and	0
i'm	0
sure	1
you	1
felt	0
the	0
s[ame]	0
the	0
same	1
frustration	1
before	1
you	0
got	1
on	0
a	0
budget	1
but	0
you're	0
wondering	1
my	0
when	0
you	0
put	1
down	0
all	1
the	0
money	0
that	0
you	0
do	1
bring	0
in	0
and	1
then	0
you're	1
saying	1
my	1
word	1
where	0
did	1
all	1
that	1
money	1
go	1

that's	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
money	1
but	0

where	1
does	1
it	1
go	1

yeah	0

huh	0

and	0
also	1
we	1
have	0
found	1
that	0
if	1
we	1
write	1
down	1
a[nd]	0
and	0
we	1
did	1
this	1
we're	1
not	0
real	1
consistent	1
with	0
this	0
but	0
we	0
did	1
it	0
for	0
about	0
a	0
month	1
and	0
we	1
wrote	0
down	0
everything	1
that	0
we	1
bought	1
with	0
you	1
know	1
every	0
paycheck	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	0
we	1
could	0
see	1
where	0
every	1
penny	1
went	1
and	1
it	1
was	0
really	0
interesting	1
to	0
see	1
just	1
what	0
you	0
do	1
spend	0
and	0
and	1
like	0
i	0
say	1
we	0
haven't	1
been	0
real	0
consistent	1
with	1
it	1
it's	0
we	0
should	1
because_1	0
it	0
does	1
help	1

yeah	1
the	0
other	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
that	0
that	0
we've	1
found	0
that	0
that	0
helps	1
if	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
tend	0
to	0
fudge	1
on	0
the	0
budget	1
a	0
little	1
bit	0
it's	0

uh-huh	0

it's	0
just	0
to	1
[laughter-uh]	0
uh	0
get	0
out	1
the	0
money	1
in	0
advance	1
and	0
put	0
it	0
in	1
uh	0
um	0
so	0
long	1
as	0
it	0
wasn't	1
you	1
know	0
unreasonably	1
high	0
but	0
for	0
things	1
like	0
food	1
expenses	1
or	0
or	1
whatever	1
just	0
put	1
it	0
in	0
a	0
in	0
an	0
envelope	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
that	1
way	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
forced	1
us	0
to	0
uh	0
stick	1
to	0
that	0
amount	1
and	0
then	0
once	1
that	0
was	0
gone	1
well	1
if	0
the	0
entertainment	1
amount	0
was	0
gone	1
for	0
the	0
month	1
oh	0
it's	0
gone	1

just	1
stick	0
to	0
that	1
uh-huh	0
that	0
is	1

yeah	0
that	0
that	1
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
really	1
good	0
idea	0

so	0

and	0
it	0
really	1
helpful	1
um	0
have	1
you	0
developed	1
a	0
savings	1
plan	1
or	0
iras	1
or	0
anything	1
like	0
that	1
yet	1

we	1
we	1
haven't	0
we	0
our	0
our	0
initial	1
goal	0
was	0
just	0
to	0
retire	1
our	0
debt	1
uh	0
completely	1
retire	0
our	0
debt	1
for	0
car	1
payments	0
and	0
credit	1
card	1
uh	0
credit	1
card	0
debt	1
and	0
and	0
all	1
of	0
that	0
and	0

oh	0
uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
we're	1
just	0
at	0
a	0
point	1
where	0
where	0
we	1
could	0
start	0
thinking	1
about	0
it	0
so	0

oh	0
that's	0
good	1
that's	1
a	0
good	0
feeling	1

yeah	1
i	0

my	0
husband	1
just	0
graduated	1
from	0
the	0
university	1
uh	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0

um-hum	0

so	0
finally	1
finally	1
we	0
are	0
getting	1
to	0
that	0
point	0
too	1

a	0
study	1

so	0
are	0
you	1
still	0
going	0
to	0
school	0
or	1

yeah	0
yeah	1
i'm	0
actually	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
mas[ter]	1

okay	1
do	1
you	0
vote	1
regular	1

yeah	0
i	1
do	0
i	1
try	0
and	1
vote	1
in	1
every	1
single	0
election	1

every	0
one	1

but	1
uh	0
that's	0
just	0
since	1
in	0
the	1
past	0
say	1
about	1
six	1
years	1
before	1
that	0
i	0
really	0
didn't	0
pay	0
any	0
attention	1
at	0
all	1

well	0
see	0
that's	0
me	1
i've	0
never	0
paid	1
any	0
attention	1
to	0
voting	1

oh	1
you	1
haven't	0

hum-um	0

yeah	0
i	1
didn't	0
use	1
to	0
but	0
now	0
i	1
really	0
because_1	1
i	0
get	0
so	0
angry	0
about	0
what	1
goes	0
on	1
and	0
then	0
i	0
feel	1
like	1
i	0
can't	1
really	0
complain	1
too	0
much	1
unless	1

unless	0
you	1
have	0
something	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
it	0

yeah	0

right	0

but	0
the	0
problem	1
is	1
that	1
i	0
am	1
very	0
liberal	1
politically	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
hardly	1
ever	1
have	0
anybody	1
that	0
wins	1
that	0
i	0
[laughter-vote]	1
[laughter-for]	1

oh	0
liberal	0
by	1
what	0
do	0
you	0
mean	0
by	0
liberal	1
um	0

liberal	0
politically	0
i'm	0
you	0
know	0
like	0
pretty	0
left	0
wing	0
demo[crat]	0
democrat	0
so	0

well	0
see	1
i	0
don't	1
know	1
anything	0
about	0
politics	1

oh	0
you	0
don't	0

uh	1
what's	0
the	0
main	1
what's	1
the	1
main	0
difference	0
between	1
republicans	0
and	0
democrats	1

okay	0
well	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them_1	1
um	0
[de]pends	0
on	0
what	0
issue	1
you're	0
talking	0
about	1
but	0
democrats	0
are	0
on	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
issues	0
are	0
more	0
liberal	0
than	1
republicans	1
and	0
well	0
it	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1
to	0
say	1
now	1
especially	1
after	0
desert	1
storm	1
but	1
um	1
i	0
think	1
back	1
in	0
the	0
eigh[ties]	1
times	1
when	0
uh	1
my	1
political	0
opinions	1
were	0
being	1
formed	0
like	0
in	0
viet[nam]	1
during	1
the	0
vietnam	1
war	0
and	0
stuff	1
the	0
republicans	1
were	1
more	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
they	0
called	1
hawks	1
which	1
is	0
more	1
like	0
aggressive	1
in	0
war	1
and	0
more	0
pro-war	1
and	0
pro-aggression	1
and	1

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
um	0
the	0
democrats	1
were	1
the	0
doves	1
they	0
were	1
more	1
for	0
peace	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
how	1
much	0
that	0
holds	1
true	0
anymore	1
i	1
think	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
issues	1
are	0

okay	1
and	1
you	1
vote	1
for	1
the	0
democrats	1
or	0

yeah	1

usually	0

yeah	0
and	1
democrats	0
usually	1
are	0
su[pportive]	1
more	0
supportive	0
of	1
public	0
assistance	0
programs	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
and	0
programs	1
to	0
um	0
th[e]	0
the	0
big	1
republican	1
thing	0
is	0
that	0
they	0
don't	1
they	0
vote	1
for	0
less	0
government	1
they	0
want	0
less	1
government	0
involvement	1
in	0
society	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
they're	1
more	0
less	1
apt	0
to	0
vote	1
in	1
you	0
know	0
more	1
aid	1
to	1
people	1
or	1
more	1
m[ore]	1
uh	0
they're	0
less	1
apt	0
to	0
vote	0
in	1
programs	1
that	0
involve	1
the	0
government	1
running	0
things	1

huh	0
okay	0

so	0
so	0
have	0
you	0
ever	0
voted	1
at	0
all	1

no	0
i	0
never	0
have	0

you	0
haven't	0

hum-um	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

i	0
don't	0
keep	1
up	0
on	0
it	1
and	0
i	0
don't	1
feel	1
like	0
i	0
ha[ve]	1
have	0
enough	0
knowledge	1

to	1
even	0
you	1

to	0
pick	1
the	0
right	0
person	1

need	1
well	1

said	0
something	1
to	0
improve	0
voting	1

uh-huh	0

if	0
they	0
could	0
make	0
it	0
more	0
oh	0
easier	0
to	0
find	0
out	0
you	0
know	0
what's	0
going	0
on	0
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i	0

like	0
to	0
me	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
didn't	0

would	0
have	0
been	0
wrong	0
with	0
i	0
can't	1
even	0
remember	0
who	0
ran	0
for	0

that	0
reagan	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
woman	1
that	0
was	0
running	1
for	0
vice	0
president	1
for	0
a	0
while	1
ferraro	0

oh	0
yeah	0
that	0
was	0

ferraro	0

yeah	0
ferraro	0
that	0
was	1
a	0
while	0
ago	1
that	0
was	1
a	0
couple	0
elections	1
ago	0
yeah	0

[laughter-okay]	0

yeah	0
that's	0
okay	0

well	1
well	1
that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
like	0
i	0
didn't	1
know	1
what	0
the	0
difference	1
between	0
dukakis	1
and	0
bush	0
was	1

um-hum	1

you	0
know	1
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
anything	1
about	0
bush	1
or	0
dukakis	1

so	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
think	1
about	1
uh	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
think	0
about	1
what	0
you	0
see	1
on	0
tv	1
about	0
them_1	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
news	1
or	0
on	0
the	0
ads	1
do	0
you	0
kind	0
of	0
just	0

okay	0
i	0
don't	0
remember	1
anything	0
about	0
dukakis	1

you	0
don't	0

but	1
well	0
they're	0
all	1
saying	0
that	0
they're	0
going	1
to	0
do	1
you	0
know	1
whatever	0
is	0
best	1
for	0
their	0
campaign	1
anyway	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
if	0
they	0
had	1
some	0
kind	0
of	0
public	0
programs	1
where	0
you	0
can	0
just	0
go	0
out	1
and	0

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
like	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
school	0
they	1
didn't	0
teach	1
you	0
about	1
demo[crats]	1
uh	0
the	1
government	1
not	0
really	1

right	0

you	0
didn't	1
get	0
any	0
government	0
classes	1

hum-um	0

yeah	0
it's	0
really	1
hard	1
too	0
because	0
before	1
they	0
used	0
to	0
have	1
um	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
the	0
stuff	1
that	0
they	0
put	0
out	0
now	1
it	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
doesn't	1
just	0
seem	1
like	1
it	0
i	0
know	0
for	0
a	0
fact	1
that	0
the	1
any	1
kind	0
of	0
stuff	1
that	0
if	0
you	1
wrote	1
and	0
asked	1
for	0
material	1
well	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
believe	1
in	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
believe	1
in	1
they	0
don't	0
take	1
any	0
stands	0
on	0
anything	1
they	0
kind	0
of	0
say	1
well	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
want	1
me	0
to	0
believe	1

yeah	0

or	0
they	0
word	1
it	0
so	0
that	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	1
to	0
tell	1
where	0
they're	0
standing	1
on	0
certain	0
issues	1

well	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
they're	0
yeah	0
i	0
know	0
how	1
they	0
do	0
it	1
it	0

um-hum	0

it	0
like	0
i[t]	0
with	0
the	0
abortion	0
issues	0
and	0
stuff	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
kind	0
of	0
take	0
a	0
stand	1
on	0
some	1
things	0
like	0
abortion	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
so	0
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
how	1
i	0
judge	1
there's	0
a	0
few	1
things	0
where	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
say	0
yes	1
or	0
no	1
like	0
abortion	1
or	0
gun	1
control	1
or	0
let	0
me	0
see	0
i	0
try	0
to	0
look	1
at	0
what	1
if	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
newspaper	1
articles	1
or	0
the	1
i	0
don't	0
trust	1
tv	1
as	0
much	1
but	0
newspaper	1
articles	1
can	1
show	1
wheth[er]	0
how	0
they	0
voted	1
in	0
the	0
past	1
and	0
but	0
you	0
get	0
you	0
know	0
it	0

right	0

it	0
all	0
depends	1
again	1
on	0
whose	0
writing	1
it	0
and	0
who	1
they're	0
for	1
because	0
they	0
can	0
slant	1
that	0
too	1

right	0
and	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
poli[ticians]	0
the	0
politicians	0
i'm	0
the	0
also	1
the	0
politicians	1
put	0
out	1
what	0
makes	1
them_1	0
look	0
good	0
anyway	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0

my	0
[laughter-family]	0

no	0

we're	0
kind	1
of	0
really	1
independent	1

all	0
split	0

but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
families	0
do	0
that	1
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
wives	1
feel	1
like	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
vote	1
the	0
way	0
that	0
their	0
husbands	0
vote	1

right	0

and	0
that	0
kind	1
of	0
keeps	1
from	0
getting	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
issues	1
resolved	1
golly	0

i	0
lie	0
hm	0

but	0
well	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	1
did	1
understand	0
politics	1
i	0
probably	1
would	0
vote	0
more	1

um-hum	0

but	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
if	0
i	0
voted	0
for	0
bush	0
or	0
like	1
when	0
uh	0
gary	1
hart	1
was	0
running	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	0
would	0
have	0
voted	1
for	0
him	1
just	0
because	1
he	0
was	0
nicer	0
looking	1
not	0

hart	0

uh-huh	0

not	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
was	0
good	0
looking	0
but	0
he	0
was	0
young	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

and	0
then	1
i	0
didn't	1
think	0
that	1
was	0
right	1
because	0
he	0
may	1
have	0
been	0
a	0
good	0
president	1
or	0
whatever	1

um-hum	0

but	0
because	0
it	0
was	0
he	0
had	0
an	0
affair	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
it	0
just	1
threw	0
him	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
whole	1
running	0

yeah	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
go	1
by	0
their	1
uh	0
personal	1
life	0
when	0
they	0
vote	1
and	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

which	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
got	0
turmoil	1
in	0
your	1
personal	1
life	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
let	1
it	0
come	1
into	0
work	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
that	0
have	1
had	0

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
everybody	0
does	0
it	0
just	0
depends	1
on	0
how	0
well	1
you	0
can	0
hide	1
it	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i	0
that's	0
very	0
true	0
i	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
doesn't	1
really	0
have	1
that	0
much	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
um	0
unless	1
they've	0
done	1
something	0
really	0
horrible	1
you	0
know	1
or	0
something	1
real	0
abnormal	1

well	0

criminal	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that's	0
different	0
but	0

yeah	0
right	0

but	0
if	0
him	1
and	0
his	0
wife	1
weren't	0
getting	0
along	1
i	0

but	0
otherwise	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	1
what	0
is	1
what	1
effect	0
does	0
that	0
have	1
on	0
him	0
running	1
for	0
president	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1

yeah	0
yeah	0

it's	0
all	0
so	0
secretive	0
see	0
we	0
really	1
don't	0
see	1
the	0
true	1
person	1
anyway	0

that's	0
right	0

i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	0
having	1
a	0
big	1
effect	0
on	0
how	1
poorly	1
that	0
the	0
country's	1
being	0
run	1
is	0
that	1
um	0
the	1
the	0
election	1
the	0
people	1
that	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
elected	1
are	0
turning	1
it	0
into	0
a	0
popularity	1
contest	1
by	0
advertising	1
the	0
things	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
that	0
really	1
don't	0
have	0
anything	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
how	0
well	1
they	0
do	0
the	0
job	1

right	0

but	0
see	0
they're	0
trying	1
to	0
find	0
an	0
excuse	1
not	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
what	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
issues	1
that	0
people	1
really	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
about	1
because	1
on	0
those	0
issues	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
say	0
yes	1
or	0
no	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
don't	1
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	1
then	1
maybe	0
somebody'll	1
vote	1
for	0
them_1	0
that	0
wouldn't	1
have	1
if	0
they	0
had	0
come	1
down	0
on	0
the	0
wrong	0
side	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
so	0

right	0

so	0
they	0
just	0
try	0
and	0
make	0
it	0
a	0
personal	0
thing	0
i	0
mean	0
if	0
you	1
remember	1
any	1
of	0
the	0
tv	0
commercials	1
from	0
the	0
last	1
presidential	0
campaign	1
they	0
all	0
had	1
uh	0
pictures	1
of	0
bush	1
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
walking	1
around	0
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
and	1
even	0
from	0
reagan	1
it	0
was	0
all	1
just	0
like	1
looks	1
like	0
a	0
mcdonald's	1
commercial	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	0

that's	1
[laughter-about]	0
what	0
it	0
looked	1
like	0

well	1
what	0
did	1
you	0
think	1
of	0
reagan	0
as	0
a	0
president	1

i	0
just	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
really	0
inept	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
he	0
did	0
anything	1
at	0
all	1
he	1
they	0
just	1
kind	0
of	0
sat	1
him	0
up	0
there	1
like	0
a	0
puppet	1
and	0
the	0
people	0
that	0
were	0

do	0
you	0
think	1
he	0
won	1
from	0
carter	1
because	1
of	0
the	1
um	0
the	1
hostages	1
that	0
were	0
held	1
at	0
that	0
time	1

well	0
i	1
think	0
that	0
was	1
part	1
of	0
it	1
i	0
think	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
the	0
the	0
economic	0
problems	0
that	0
the	0
country	1
was	0
having	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
the	0
the	0
recession	0
and	0
stuff	0
people	1

um-hum	0

people	1
just	0
had	0
a	0
picture	0
of	0
carter	1
as	0
not	0
being	0
real	0
capable	1
but	0
he	0
actually	0
all	0
right	0
[laughter-this]	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	0

i	0
thought	1
carter	0
was	0
good	0
too	1
and	0
that	0
was	0
yeah	0

did	0
you	0
i	0
always	0
liked	0
him	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
couldn't	1
get	0
over	1
the	0
fact	0
that	0
reagan	1
beat	0
him	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
i	0
just	1
couldn't	0
believe	1
that	0
he	1
got	0
voted	0
out	1

but	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
wasn't	0
well	0
let's	0
see	0
that's	0
been	0
about	1
ten	0
years	0
ago	0
right	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0

okay	0
so	0
i	0
was	0
only	0
fifteen	1
or	0
sixteen	1
but	0
i	0
remember	0
carter	0
and	0
i	0
liked	0
him	0

you	0
did	0
have	0
you	0
heard	1
stuff	0
about	0
him	0
lately	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
he's	1
doing	1

no	0
i	0
sure	0
don't	0

well	0
he	1
is	0
just	1
he	0
is	0
really	1
active	0
still	0
politically	1
he's	0
been	0
overseas	0
you	0
remember	1
when	0
he	1
was	0
in	0
office	1
he	0
did	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
stuff	1
for	0
the	0
middle	1
ea[st]	0
for	1
pe[ople]	0

bracket	0

uh-huh	0

uh	0
i	1

[sup]posed	0
to	0
get	0
out	0
of	0

she	1
was	0
gonna	0
get	0
picked	0
up	0
she	1
was	0
gonna	0
pick	0
him	0
up	1
because_1	0
she	1
only	0
lives	1
in	0
you	0
know	0
like	0
two	1
blocks	0
away	0
from	0
the	0
school	1
i	0
was	0
trying	1
to	0
get	0
my	0
husband	1
to	0
come	0
and	0
pick	0
him	0
up	1
and	0
all	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	1
and	0
he	1
had	0
a	0
hundred	1
and	0
four	0
fever	0
they	0
couldn't	1
uh	0
to	0
give	1
him	0
anything	0
because	0
they're	1
not	0
allowed	1
to	0
at	0
school	0
and	0
everything	0

right	1

i	0
was	0
so	1
furious	1
i	0
i	0
quit	1
that	0
job	0
and	0
i	0
stayed	0
home	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
longer	0
then	1
i	0
went	0
and	0
got	1
a	0
um	0
a	0
job	1
in	0
real	1
estate	0
where	0
i	0
can	0
kind	0
of	0
adjust	1
my	0
time	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
better	1

yeah	0
a	0
li[ttle]	0
little	1
bit	0
more	0
flexibility	1
you	0
can	0
come	1
and	0
go	1

yeah	1
but	0
uh	0
i	1
haven't	0
had	0
any	0
good	0
really	0
very	1
good	0
experience	0
with	0
child	1
care	0

yeah	1
well	1
when	0
our	1
kids	0
were	0
small	1
we	0
had	0
a	0
couple	1
of	0
uh	0
good	0
good	0
women	1
who	0
uh	0
would	0
often	1
co[me]	0
uh	0
get	1
them_1	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
the	0
house	1
and	0

you	1
wanna	1
go	1
first	1

no	1
you	1
can	0
start	1

okay	1
um	1
one	1
of	1
the	0
things	1
they	1
talked	1
about	1
was	1
uh	0
did	1
we	1
di[d]	0
wha[t]	1
do	1
what	1
do	0
we	0
think	1
about	0
a	0
judge	1
making	1
the	1
decision	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	1
really	1
don't	0
agree	1
with	1
that	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	1
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
is	0
better	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
than	1
e[ven]	0
having	1
a	0
unanimous	1
decision	1
rather	1
than	0
to	1
have	1
one	0
person	1
be	0
responsible	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
that	1
they	0
could	1
be	1
objective	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
every	1
time	1

right	1

y[ou]	0
you	0
know	1
what	0
i	0
mean	1

right	1
there's	1
there	1
th[is]	1
thi[s]	1
this	1
topic	0
is	0
kind	0
of	0
moot	1
um	0
there	1

yeah	1

there	1
there's	0
no	0
way	1
we	1
we	1
couldn't	1
survive	1
in	1
a	1
sy[stem]	1
in	1
a	1
in	0
a	0
juror	1
syst[em]	0
in	1
a	0
trial	1
system	1
without	1
a	0
jury	1

right	1

um	1
one	1
man	0
can	1
never	1
be	0
one	0
man	1
one	0
woman	1
can	0
never	1
be	0
objectionable	1
in	0
every	1
case	1

that's	0
it	1

um	1
every	1
person	1
has	1
their	1
opinions	1
and	1
that's	1
why	1
jury	1
selection	0
is	1
often	1
very	0
difficult	1
um	1

well	0
i	1
i	0
feel	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
too	1
uh	0
they	1
were	0
saying	1
uh	1
you	1
know	0
what	1
new	1
ways	1
could	1
you	0
could	1
it	0
you	1
you	1
know	0
change	1
the	0
system	1
i	1
i	0
really	1
think	0
that	1
um	1
we	1
spend	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
time	1
uh	0
going	1
through	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
i	0

i	0
mean	0
i[f]	1
if	0
you	1
go	1
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
and	0
especially	1
if	0
a	0
person	1
has	1
confessed	1
if	0
they	0
have	1
been	0
caught	1
you	1
know	0
point	1
blank	1
in	1
the	0
crime	1
there's	0
uh	0
no	1
question	1
it's	0

right	1

it's	0
beyond	1
a	0
reasonable	1
doubt	1
you	0
all	1
these	0
things	1
i	1
mean	0
you	1
know	0
we've	1
gone	1
through	1
this	1
uh	0
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1

right	1
they	0
shouldn't	0
allow	1
an	0
appeal	1

and	1
it	1
can	0
go	0
on	1
for	0
ten	1
twenty	1
years	0

yep	1

i	0
i	1
think	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
little	1
ridiculous	1

[laughter-um-hum]	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
only	1
people	0
who	1
benefit	1
from	0
that	0
are	0
the	0
lawyers	1

no	1
that's	0
right	1
i	0
work	1
for	0
a	1
law	1
firm	1
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-ought]	0

i	1
i'm	0
serious	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
lawyers	1
have	0
caused	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
problems	1
tha[t]	1
ha[ppen]	0
that	1
exist	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
criminal	1
system	0
today	1
with	0
plea	1
bargaining	1

right	1

you	1
know	0
if	0
someone	1
is	0

well	1
plea	1
bar[gaining]	1
plea	1
bargaining	1
is	1
a	0
different	0
story	1

well	1

plea	1
bargaining	1
is	0
something	0
completely	1
different	1
that	1
that	1
actually	0
prevents	1
trials	1
or	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
speeds	1
them_1	0
up	1

well	1
i	0
know	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	1
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
all	1
of	0
the	0
whole	0
criminal	1
system	1
is	0
messed	1
up	1
in	0
in	0
that	1
regard	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
know	1
people	1
who	0
commit	1
uh	0
crimes	1
that	0
they	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	1
it	0
works	1
exactly	1
but	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	0
lesser	1
sentences	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
understand	0
that	0
the	0
jails	1
are	0
full	0
of	0
people	1
you	0
know	1
uh	1
and	0
that	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
do	0
something	1

right	1

but	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
reason	1
they	0
are	1
full	0
is	0
because	1
they	0
know	1
that	0
they	1
can	0
get	0
away	1
with	0
it	0

hum	1

you	0
you	1
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
tha[t]	0
we	0
we	1
don't	0
have	1
um	1
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
states	0
don't	1
have	0
capital	0
punishment	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
i	1
think	1
they	0
should	1

we	1
do	0

i	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
if	0
a	0
person	1
is	0
guilty	1
of	0
taking	1
someone's	0
life	1
and	0
like	0
you	0
say	1
it's	0
it's	0
there's	0
no	1
doubt	1
whatsoever	0
like	0
drunk	0
drivers	1
that	0
kill	1
people	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
all	1

right	1

they	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	1
i	0
i	1
just	0
think	1
that	0
that's	1
they've	0
they've	1
taken	1
a	0
life	1
and	0
if	1
they	1
should	0
pay	1
for	0
it	0
with	0
their	1
life	1

right	1
when	0
you're	0
saying	1
as	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	0
appeal	1
um	1
procedure	1
is	0
concerned	1

yeah	1

we	1
just	0
have	0
the	0
case	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
you've	0
probably	0
heard	1
of	0
marion	1
berry	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
his	1
fi[nal]	0
his	0
last	1
appeal	1
was	1
was	0
denied	1
two	1
days	0
before	0
his	0
sentence	1
was	0
up	1

oh	0
really	1

so	1
i	0
mean	1
his	0
appeal	1
was	0
denied	1
and	0
two	1
days	0
later	0
he	0
got	0
out	0
of	0
jail	1
for	0
cocaine	1
possession	1

it	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	0
um	0
that	1
was	0
absurd	1
there	0
was	0
no	0
there	1
was	0
no	1
reason	0
the	1
appeal	1
process	0
should	0
have	1
dragged	1
on	0
that	0
long	1
for	0
a	0
six	1
month	0
sentence	1

i	1
know	0
that	1
the	1

uh-huh	1
an[d]	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
wha[t]	0
what	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
to	1
change	1
it	0
to	0
make	1
it	0
better	1

well	1
uh	0
the	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	0
can	1
i	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
the	1
the	0
appeal	1
procedure	1
is	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	1
can	0
possibly	0
think	1
of	0
um	1
i	0
like	1
i	0
said	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
removing	1
of	0
the	0
jury	1
and	0
having	1
the	0
judge	1
sentence	0
that's	1
absurd	1
there's	1
no	0
way	0
that	1
could	0
work	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
don't	0
agree	1
with	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	1
but	1

imagine	1
the	0
guilt	1
that	0
person	0
would	0
have	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
burned	1
out	1

oh	0
exactly	1

is	1
there's	0
no	0
possible	1
way	1
that	0
you	1
could	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
feel	0
good	1
about	0
yourself	1

exactly	1

right	1

if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
do	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
day	1
after	0
day	1

no	1
one	0
would	0
want	1
the	0
job	1

no	1
rea[lly]	1
not	0
really	1

um	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
like	0
i	1
said	1
the	0
you	0
know	1
everyone	1
has	0
their	0
opinions	1
about	0
every	0
case	1

well	0
wou[ld]	1
do	0
you	1
think	0
people	1
should	0
have	1
a	1
trial	1
if	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	1
like	1

oh	1
yeah	0
i	0
i	0
feel	0
that	0
everyone	1
is	0
everyone	1
is	0
um	1
entitled	1
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
that	1
that	1
that	0
right	1
sh[ould]	0

i	1
mean	0
supposing	1
i	1
come	0
up	0
to	0
you	1
and	0
i	0
just	0
point	1
blank	1
kill	1
you	0

well	1
i	0
mean	1
were	0
there	0
witnesses	1

in	0
other	1
words	1
you're	0
saying	1
that	0
we	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
whether	0
it's	0
premeditated	1
or	1
what	1
the	0
circumstances	1
were	1

right	1

right	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
you	0
can't	1
remove	0
the	0
jury	1
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
case	1

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
you	1
could	0
have	0
fifty	1
people	1
in	0
audience	1
watching	1
a	0
murder	1
take	0
place	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
you	1
you'd	0
still	1
there's	0
still	1
mitigating	0
circumstances	1

well	0
it's	0
i	1
i	1
feel	0

well	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
like	1
that	0
topic	1

uh	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
i've	1
got	0

do	1
you	0
i	1
don't	1

no	1
okay	1

no	0
i'm	1
pretty	0
opinionated	1
about	1
that	1
and	0
many	1
other	0
things	1
as	1
you	0
well	0
know	1
i	1
agree	1
with	0
it	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
company	1
should	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
test	1
at	0
any	0
any	1
employee	1
anytime	1
they	0
see	1
fit	1

well	1

i	0
just	0
i	0
just	0
don't	0
think	0
there's	0
a	0
place	1
in	0
our	1
en[vironment]	0
environment	1
you	1
know	1
in	0
the	1
work	1
force	1
for	0
drugs	1
or	0
alcohol	1
either	1

well	1
i	0
don't	1
believe	0
in	0
drugs	0
or	0
alcohol	1
but	0
if	1
you'll	1
remember	0
when	0
the	0
teachers	1
had	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
tcat	1
they	0
were	0
talking	1
about	1
drug	1
testing	1
us	0

right	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
we	0
were	1
laughing	1
that	1
we'd	1
have	0
to	1
go	0
to	1
that	0
examination	1
to	0
prove	1
we	0
could	0
read	0
and	0
write	1
with	0
a	0
specimen	0
of	0
urine	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
we	1
found	0
it	0
belittling	1

you	0
did	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	0
well	1
i	1
can	0
sort	0
of	0
understand	0
that	1
uh	0
but	0
not	1
being	1
a	0
teacher	0
as	0
you	1
are	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
i	0
was	0
not	0
quite	1
as	0
sympathetic	1
as	0
you	1
know	0
as	0
i	1
probably	0
would	1
have	1
been	0
if	1
if	0
kay	1
were	1
a	1
teacher	1
or	0
something	1

that's	1
true	0

but	1
uh	0

but	1
then	0
you	1
know	1
at	0
the	0
same	1
token	1
i'm	0
not	1
against	1
because	0
i	0
look	1
at	0
airline	1
pilots	0
bus	1
drivers	0
you	1
know	0
people	1
that	1
really	1
have	1
other	1
peoples'	0
lives	1
in	0
their	1
hands	1
truck	1
drivers	1

uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

that's	0
right	1

that's	0
right	1

it's	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	1
a	1
huge	1
problem	0
with	0
truck	1
drivers	0
using	1
drugs	0
and	1
alcohol	0

th[at's]	0
that's	0
right	1
and	0

and	0
i	1
think	0
it	0
is	1
a	0
big	0
problem	0
with	0
them	0
using	0
drugs	0
from	0
what	0
you	0
read	1
you	0
know	1

and	1

but	1
uh	0

you	1
know	0
in	0
those	1
areas	0
i	0
really	1
you	1
know	0
do	0
believe	1
that	0
maybe	1
we	0
should	1
clean	1
up	0
our	0
you	1
know	0
house	1

yeah	1
i	1
think	1
so	0
too	1
i	1

i	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
it	1
uh	0
i	1
know	0
kay's	1
company	0
you	0
know	1
they	1
started	0
it	0
couple	0
of	0
years	1
ago	0
and	1
so	0
many	1
of	0
the	0
people	0
even	0
the	0
professional	1
people	0
were	0
boy	1
they	1
were	0
so	1
against	1
them	0
doing	1
that	0
you	0
know	1
and	0
i	0
thought	0
jeez	1
to	0
me	1
it's	0
quite	1
simple	1
uh	0
you	0
either	0
need	1
a	0
job	1
or	0
you	0
don't	1
the	0
the	0
job	1
is	0
what	0
provides	1
all	1
of	0
your	0
needs	1
and	0
uh	0
if	0
they	1
say	0
hey	1
you	0
can't	0
do	1
this	0
work	1
i'd	0
say	0
hey	1
i	0
agree	1
i	0
don't	0
i	0
won't	0
do	1
that	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
most	1
of	0
them_1	0
have	0
agreed	1
to	0
that	0
now	1
although	0
they	0
didn't	0
like	1
it	0
at	0
first	0

yeah	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
just	0
like	0
anything	0
else	1
a	0
new	0
concept	1
you	1
know	0
as	0
i	1
had	0
said	0
if	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
testing	1
area	0
with	0
my	0
urine	1
specimen	0
i	0
was	0
insulted	1

yeah	0
i[t]	0
it	0
it	0
is	0
i	1
can	0
see	1
where	0
you	0
would	0
think	0
yeah	1
that	0
is	1
belittling	1
you	1
know	0
i'd	1
probably	0
feel	1
the	0
same	0
way	1
if	0
i	1
had	0
to	0
do	0
that	0

but	0
at	0
the	0
same	1
token	1
in	0
education	1
we	0
can't	0
do	0
d[rug]	0
drug	0
random	1
drug	0
testing	0
on	0
kids	1

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

you	0
know	1
i	1
mean	0
their	1
rights	0
are	0
protected	1

you	1
bet	1
oh	1
gosh	1
they	1
w[ould]	1
they	0
would	0
really	1
raise	1
a	1
stink	1
if	1
that	1
was	0
to	0
happen	1

what	0

well	1
but	0
why	1
if	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
do	0
teachers	1
or	0
professionals	1
why	1
not	0
do	1
the	0
kids	0
when	0
we	0
see	1
them	0
and	0
they're	0
you	1
know	0
under	1
the	0
influence	0

right	1
yes	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
that	0
i	0
i	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
be	0
opposed	0
to	0
it	0
at	0
all	1
it's	0
just	0
our	0
bleeding	1
heart	0
liberals	1
that	0
would	0
fight	1
it	0
too[th]	0
tooth	0
and	0
nail	1
you	0
know	1

that's	1
true	1

but	0
uh	0
well	1
lynn	1
i've	1
enjoyed	0
talking	1
with	0
you	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	0
long	0
we're	0
suppos[ed]	0
to	0
carry	0
on	0
a	0
conversation	1
do	0
you	1

it's	0
three	1
minutes	0
and	0
the	0
clicker	1
comes	0
in	0
when	0
it's	0
time	1
to	0

oh	0
well	0
we'd	1
better	0
keep	0
talking	1
because_1	0
i've	1
not	0
heard	1
it	0
have	1
we	0

yeah	1

have	0
you	1
heard	0
it	0

no	1

anyway	1
we	0
both	1
a	0
sort	1
of	0
agree	1
on	0
it	0
don't	1
we	0
a[bout]	0
about	0
random	1
testing	0

well	1
do	0
we	0
agree	1
or	1
unless	1
it's	1
it's	0
not	1
me	1

well	0
you	0
see	1

you	1
know	0
here	0
we	0
go	1
again	0
i	1
mean	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

yeah	1
you	1
know	0
i	0

if	0
you	0
agree	1
yeah	1

i	0
believe	1
that	0
truck	1
drivers	0
and	0
people	1
that	0
have	0
even	0
though	0
teachers	1
have	0
other	0
kids	0
lives	0
in	0
their	0
hands	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
stoned	1
or	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
drunk	1

yeah	1

and	0
there	1
was	0
an	0
incident	1
in	0
my	0
children's	0
high	1
school	0
where	0
a	0
teacher	1
stayed	1
drunk	0

is	1
that	0
right	1

uh-huh	0

you	0
just	1
don't	0
think	1
of	0
that	0
happening	1
with	0
teachers	1

and	1
yet	1

i	0
really	1
don't	1
i	0
when	0
i	1
think	0
of	0
drug	1
testing	0
i'm	1
thinking	0
of	0
the	0
uh	0
you	0
kn[ow]	0
outside	1
of	0
education	0

uh	0
well	1
no	1
it	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
are	0
as	0
susceptible	1
a	0
society	1
as	0
anybody	0
else	1

sure	1
sure	1

i	0
know	1
that	0
but	0
uh	0
you	0
don't	0
think	1
of	0
that	0
first	0
hand	1
normally	1

and	0
uh	0

yeah	1
well	1
did	0
you	0
hear	1
on	0
the	0
news	1
where	0
the	0
teacher	1
of	0
the	0
year	1
was	0
up	0
for	0
child	1
molestation	0

isn't	1
that	0
isn't	1
that	0
mind	1
boggling	1

it	0
was	0
on	0
the	0
news	1
tonight	1

goodness	1
it	0
it	0
is	1
it's	0
mind	1
bogg[ling]	0
and	0
well	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
agree	0
with	0
you	0
i	1
know	0
teachers	1
are	0
just	0
like	0
everybody	0
else	1
same	1
problems	1
the	0
same	0
uh	0
good	0
qualities	1
as	0
anybody	0
else	1

yeah	1

then	1
i	1
think	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
it	0
came	1
push	1
came	0
to	0
shove	0
i'd	0
probably	1
be	0
drug	1
tested	0
you	1
know	0
because_1	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

because_1	0
it	0
does	1
you	1
know	0

y[ou]	0
you	0
think	1
the	0
benefit	1
would	0
be	0
greater	1
than	0
the	0

yeah	1
because_1	0
you	0
know	1
as	0
i	0
say	1
i'm	0
sitting	1
there	0
fussing	0
and	0
fussing	1
and	0
yet	1
i	0
know	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
one	1
teacher	0
who	0
was	1
an	0
alcoholic	0
in	1
school	1
as	0
well	0
as	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
presume	1
out	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
that	1
was	0
in	0
your	1
children's	0
high	1
school	0

um-hum	0

isn't	0
that	0
amazing	1

and	0
you	1
know	0
my	1
children	1
brought	0
it	0
to	0
my	1
attention	0
i	0
never	0
was	0
there	1
to	0
see	1
it	0

if	0
it	0
if	0
it's	0
if	0
it	0
was	0
true	1
there	1
i'm	0
sure	1
it's	0
true	0
with	0
just	0
about	0
probably	1
to	0
some	1
degree	0
every	0
school	1
there	0
is	1

um-hum	0

you	1
know	0
because	0
they	0
represent	1
a	0
pretty	1
good	0

and	0
that's	1
not	0
giving	0
a	0
good	0
example	1
to	0
students	1

no	1
certainly	0
not	1
uh	0
certainly	0
not	1
they	0
don't	0
need	1
that	0
example	0
but	0

okay	1

the	1
topic	1
is	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
uh	1
sources	1
where	1
i	1
receive	0
news	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
for	0
me	1
that's	0
uh	0
mostly	0
newspaper	1
and	0
radio	1
i	0
almost	0
never	1
watch	1
television	1
as	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0
course	1
so	0
i	1
don't	0
get	0
news	0
from	0
television	1
except	0
during	1
the	0
war	0
i	0
watched	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
cnn	1
because	0
it	1
was	0
so	0
good	1

uh-huh	0

well	0
why	1
was	0
cnn	1
the	0
on[ly]	0
of	0
course	0
i	1
think	1
saddam	1
hussein	1
only	0
allowed	1
cnn	1
to	0
broadcast	1
it	1
is	0
that	1
not	0
true	1

um	0

it	1
was	0
unusual	1
not	0
to	0
have	1
the	0
different	1
sources	1
you	0
know	1
of	1
news	0
coverage	1

yeah	1
um	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
i	0
guess	0
uh	0
i	1
don't	0
even	0
know	0
why	1
i	1
watch	1
cnn	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	1
wanted	1
more	0
news	1
it's	0
one	1
of	1
the	0
few	1
times	1
i	1
wanted	0
more	0
news	0
than	0

yeah	1
well	0
i	1
know	0
even	1
if	1
you	0
watched	1
abc	1
nbc	0
or	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
y[ou]	0
i	1
mean	0
what's	1
the	1
other	0
one	0
uh	0
cbs	1

cbs	1

they	1
all	1
were	0
were	0
tapped	1
into	0
cnn	1

were	1
they	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

that's	1
the	0
only	0
thing	1
they	1
broadcast	1
an[d]	1
like	1
you	1
i	1
listen	1
to	1
the	0
radio	1
on	0
my	0
job	1
at	0
work	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
all	1
this	0
week	0
they've	0
been	0
having	0
this	0
uh	0
a	1
discussion	1
about	0
that	1
is	1
why	1
uh	1
why	1
cnn	1
was	0
well	0
i	1
listen	0
to	0
a	0
christian	1
radio	1
station	0

um-hum	0

and	1
they	0
were	1
saying	1
that	1
cnn	1
is	0
definitely	1
a	0
world	1
uh	0
news	1
service	1
and	1
uh	0
that	1
was	0
you	0
can't	1
really	0
be	0
sure	1
of	0
the	0
quality	1
of	0
what	0
you	0
got	1
you	0
know	1

hm	1

uh	0
we	0
had	1
some	0
uh	0
some	0
people	1
from	0
our	0
church	1
went	0
to	0
israel	1
uh	0
just	0
for	1
a	0
uh	0
tour	1
sort	1
of	0
thing	0

um-hum	1

and	1
i	0
was	0
watching	1
on	0
tv	1
they	0
they	0
broadcast	0
this	0
terrible	1
riot	1
supposedly	0
that	0
was	0
going	1
on	0
in	0
jerusalem	1
so	0
we	0
got	0
all	1
fearful	1
for	0
our	1
people	0
come	0
to	0
find	0
out	1
they	0
came	0
back	1
and	0
said	0
they	0
weren't	0
even	0
aware	1
of	0
it	1

right	1

and	0
so	1
it	0
really	1
made	0
me	0
question	1
as	0
to	0
what	1
how	1
do	0
we	0
know	1
ab[out]	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
if	0
the	0
news	0
we're	0
getting	1
is	0
any	0
good	1
so	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	0
the	0
news	0
just	0
focuses	0
on	0
major	0
events	1
that	0
probably	0
don't	0
affect	0
ninety	0
nine	0
percent	0
of	1
the	0
people	1
who	0
are	0
right	0
there	1
when	0
the	0
news	1
is	0
being	0
made	1

yeah	1

right	1
right	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
c[an]	0
i'm	1
from	0
california	1
and	1
i	1
can	0
remember	1
being	0
in	0
uh	0
in	0
these	0
earthquakes	1
and	0
i	0
mean	0
they	1
were	0
they	0
were	0
very	0
minor	1
kinds	0
of	0
things	1
from	0
my	1
point	1
of	1
view	0
and	0
it	0
seemed	1
you	0
know	0
from	0
anyone	0
else's	1
point	0
of	0
view	0
but	0

yeah	0

but	0
they'd	0
get	0
all	1
blown	0
up	0
in	0
the	0
news	0
uh	0

uh-huh	0
well	0
i	1
it	0
i	1
find	0
it	0
depressing	1
to	0
watch	1
or	0
especially	1
tv	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0
uh	0
local	1
news	0
concentrates	1
on	0
murders	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
i'm	1
from	0
dallas	1
and	0
uh	0
we	1
have	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
bad	1
stuff	1
it	0
just	0
really	1
gets	0
me	0
depressed	1
even	0
to	0
watch	1
it	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0
yeah	1

so	0
then	1
you	0
wake	1
up	0
one	1
morning	0
and	1
you're	0
in	0
war	1
with	0
somebody	0
you	0

i've	0
i've	0
i've	1
never	0
done	1
this	0
before	0
i	0
mean	0
i've	1
never	0

this	1
is	0
your	0
first	0

because_1	0
i	0

yeah	1
well	1

so	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
are	0
we	0
suppose	1
to	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
me	0
it	0
says	0
you're	0
supposed	0
to	0
talk	1
for	0
three	0
minutes	1
but	0
i	0
think	0
we've	0
been	0
talking	1
for	0
three	0
minutes	0
and	0
nobody	0
has	0
interrupted	1

well	1
i'd	0
i	0
got	1
into	0
a	0
conversation	0
last	1
night	0
with	0
a	0
lady	1
and	0
they	0
interrupt	1
at	0
ten	1
minutes	1

i	1
see	0

so	1
if	0
we've	0
done	1
our	0
three	0
minutes	0
let's	0
just	0
let	1
the	0
conversation	0
end	1
and	0
say	0
bye	1

uh-huh	0

well	0
all	0
right	1
nice	0
talking	1
to	0
you	0

[laughter-nice]	1
[laughter-talking]	0
to	0
you	0
too	0
bye-bye	1

all	1
right	0
bye	1

bye-bye	1

okay	1
well	1
um	1
i	1
used	1
to	0
work	1
in	1
a	1
day	0
care	1
center	1

uh-huh	1

i	1
worked	1
in	1
um	1
in	1
all	1
the	0
different	1
areas	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
care	1
center	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
deceiving	1
to	1
people	1
i	1
did	0
not	0
work	1
there	0
long	1
because	1
i	0
couldn't	1
handle	1
the	1
the	1
treatment	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
got	1
and	0
this	1
is	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	1
a	0
very	1
well-known	0
center	1
here	0
in	0
tyler	1
who	0
had	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
um	0
centers	1
all	0
over	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
um	1
city	1
and	1

um-hum	0

and	1
they	1
would	1
um	1
be	0
one	1
way	1
when	0
the	0
parents	1
were	0
there	1
and	0
be	1
another	1
way	1
when	0
the	1
parents	0
left	1

yeah	1

so	1
um	1
i	1
think	1
you	1
need	1
to	0
make	1
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
do	1
do	1
day	1
care	1
centers	1
you	1
know	1
you	0
should	1
make	1
frequent	1
checks	1
and	1
um	0
to	0
check	0
in	1
on	0
them_1	0
when	0
they're	1
[laughter-not]	0
[laughter-expecting]	1
it	1

because	0
they	1
do	1
do	0
things	0
differently	1
when	1
you're	1
not	0
around	1
so	1

well	0
that	0
i	0
know	0
wh[at]	1
the	1
things	1
that	0
we	1
kind	1
of	0
looked	0
at	1
is	0
is	0
you	0
wanna	1
see	1
how	1
many	0
teachers	1
you	0
have	1
and	0
and	0
how	1
many	0
kids	1
they	0
have	0
and	0
how	1
they	0
break	0
it	1
up	0

um-hum	0

right	1

because	1
we	1
had	0
we	1
had	0
one	0
that	0
sounds	0
kind	1
of	0
like	0
what	0
you	1
were	0
in	1

um-hum	0

it	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
really	1
good	1
one	1
and	0
in	0
fact	1
it	0
worked	0
out	1
for	0
us	1
because_1	0
my	1
wife	1
we	1
kind	0
of	0
bartered	1
my	0
wife	1
did	1
artwork	1
for	1
them_1	0
and	1
then	1
you	1
know	1
so	0
we	1
got	1
our	1
uh	0
day	1
care	0
free	1

um-hum	0

but	1
they	1
didn't	0
have	0
enough	0
teachers	1
and	1

well	0
this	1
one	0
was	0
set	0
up	1
good	1
i	0
mean	0
they	0
had	1
two	1
teachers	1
to	0
every	1
room	1
um	0
sometimes	1
three	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
they	0
had	1
a	0
good	1
system	1
like	0
so	1
when	0
you	0
walked	0
in	1
everything	1
looks	0
cool	1

um-hum	0

the	1
problem	1
i	1
had	0
was	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
affection	1
to	0
the	1
children	1
enough	1
they	1
did	0
not	0
show	1
them	0
care	1
to	0
these	0
small	1
children	1
who	0
are	1
being	0
left	1

um-hum	0

um	0
they	1
one	1
time	0
i	1
picked	0
up	1
this	1
little	1
boy	1
who	0
was	1
crying	1
and	0
the	0
owner	1
came	1
and	0
just	0
chewed	1
me	1
up	0
one	0
side	1
and	0
down	0
the	0
other	0
you	0
know	1
he	0

hm	0

he	0
said	0
you	1
are	0
gonna	0
have	0
every	1
child	0
in	0
here	0
wanting	0
you	0
to	0
pick	0
them_1	0
up	1

and	0
i	1
said	0
no	1
this	0
child	0
was	0
crying	1
and	0
needed	0
some	0
comfort	1
you	0
know	1
what	1

yeah	1

what	1
is	1
your	1
problem	0
so	1
um	0

did	0
did	0
they	0
separate	1
them_1	0
by	0
age	1
group	1

yes	1

because_1	0
i'd	1
think	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
that's	1
one	0
thing	0
that	0
was	0
important	1

right	1
they	0
did	1
they	0
had	1
like	0
um	0
the	0
the	0
crawlers	1
the	0
babies	1
that	0
didn't	1
walk	0
in	0
one	1
room	0
the	0
ones	1
that	0
were	0
starting	1
to	0
walk	0
in	0
one	0
room	1

uh-huh	0

then	0
they	0
had	1
like	1
the	0
um	0
three	1
three	0
year	0
olds	1
upper	1
fours	1
lower	1
fours	1
upper	0
fives	1
lower	0
fives	1
you	1
know	0
just	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	1

you	1
know	0
they	0
really	1
did	0
separate	1
them_1	0
well	0

it	0
it	0
sound	1
yeah	1

it	1
was	0
just	1
the	0
teachers	1
themselves	1

it	0
sounds	1
like	0
to	0
me	1
your	1
your	1
concern	1
would	0
be	0
to	0
make	0
sure	1
that	0
they	0
are	0
loving	1
people	0
affectionate	1
people	0
that	0
they're	1
they're	0
kind	1
of	0
par[ents]	0
maybe	0
parents	1
themselves	1
or	0
something	1

right	1

but	0
yeah	1
that	0
they're	1
not	0

yeah	1
their	0
system	1

right	1
but	0
their	1
but	0
their	0
system	1
was	0
was	0
great	1
but	0
um	0
the	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
caring	1
just	0
wasn't	0
there	1

um-hum	0

the	0
one	1
woman	1
that	0
taught	1
that	0
did	1
the	0
babies	1
i	0
worked	1
with	0
her	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
fabulous	1

um-hum	0

she	0
loved	1
them	0
babies	1
and	0
she	0
loved	1
them_1	0
and	0
cared	1
for	0
them_1	0
but	0
um	0
every	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
others	1
that	0
i	0
saw	1
was	0
just	0
screaming	1
and	0
yelling	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
would	0
make	1
me	1
a	0
nervous	0
wreck	1
[laughter-so]	0
you	1
know	0

yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
think	0
that's	0
probably	0
a	0
really	1
important	0
thing	1
because	0
you	1
can	0
have	0
doctorates	1
and	0
phd's	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
know	1
all	0
the	0
technical	1
stuff	0
but	0
if	0
they	0
don't	0
reach	0
out	1
and	0
touch	0
the	0
kids	1
then	0
that	1
doesn't	0
do	0
any	0
good	1

yeah	0
these	0
kids	1
are	0
just	0
in	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0
all	0
day	1
and	1
uh	0
with	0
no	1
any	0
type	0
of	0
emotional	1
you	0
know	1
getting	0
love	1
getting	0
care	1
they're	0

yeah	1

they're	0
just	0
there	1
you	0
know	1
going	1
through	0
this	0
routine	1
which	0
is	0
lousy	1

yeah	1

an[d]	0

the	0
other	1
the	0
other	1
group	0
that	0
we	1
had	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
interesting	1
the	0
other	1
one	0
we	1
went	0
to	0
the	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
husband	1
and	0
wife	1
team	0

um-hum	0

and	0
we	1
knew	0
them	0
from	0
other	0
associations	1
but	0
uh	0
it	0
was	0
kind	1
of	0
interesting	1
because	0
she	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
the	0
strict	1
one	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
you	1
know	0
she	1
would	0
she'd	1
put	0
her	0
arm	1
around	0
the	0
kids	0
and	0
talk	1
to	0
them_1	0
and	0
stuff	1
you	0
know	1
but	0
he	1
was	0
actually	0
the	0
more	1
um	0
the	0
more	1
uh	0
what	0
demonstrative	1
type	1
the	0
more	0
loving	1
he	0

um-hum	0

he	0
would	0
you	1
know	0
laugh	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
play	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	1
and	1
it	0
it	0
it	0
was	0
kind	0
of	0
interesting	1
to	0
see	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
actually	1
the	0
man	1
in	0
the	0
group	1
that	0
that	0
did	1
that	0
side	1
of	0
it	0

uh-huh	0

an[d]	0

yeah	0
you	0
don't	1
see	1
that	0
much	1

yeah	1
so	0
they	1
had	1
a	0
really	1
nice	0
balance	1
we	1
liked	1
that	0
one	0
in	1
fact	1
it	0
was	0
called	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
play	1
school	0
or	0
something	1
but	0

that's	0
cute	1

but	0
they	0
also	1
did	1
they	0
also	1
did	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
teaching	1
things	1
and	0
then	0
they	0
had	1
um	0
you	0
know	1
obedience	1
obedience	1
was	0
important	1

yeah	0
that	0
has	1
to	0
be	1
with	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0

and	1
you	1
know	0
so	0
they	1
u[sed]	0
you	0
know	1
they	0
used	1
uh	0
oh	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
used	1
the	0
you	0
probably	0
heard	1
where	0
you	1
know	1
where	0
you	0
stand	1
in	0
front	1
of	1
the	0
clock	1
and	0
get	1
your	0
power	1
back	1
to	0
control	1
yourself	1

i've	0
never	1
heard	1
of	0
that	1
that's	1
that's	1
a	0
new	1
one	0
on	0
me	1

and	0
it's	0
it's	0
it's	0
one	1

uh	0
i	1
can't	0
remember	1
what	1
they	0
call	0
it	0
exactly	1
but	0
y[ou]	0
you	0
just	0
stand	1
them_1	0
in	0
front	0
of	0
the	0
clock	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
has	0
a	0
second	1
hand	0
that	0
goes	0
around	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	1
have	0
to	0
stand	1
there	0

i	0
had	0
it	0
five	1
years	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
year	1
or	0
last	1
two	1
years	1
it	0
seemed	1
to	1
go	0
out	1
really	1
easily	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
went	0
out	0
twice	1
in	0
two	0
years	1
and	0
that's	1
that's	1
a	1
lot	1
it	1
shouldn't	1
go	0
out	1
that	1
much	1

no	1
hm	0

and	1
so	1
i	0
went	1
ahead	1
and	0
bought	0
another	1
standard	1
when	1
i	1
bought	1
the	0
honda	1
but	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
i'm	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
that	0
again	1
i	0
think	0
i'm	1
going	0
back	0
to	0
automatic	1
now	1

well	1
i	0
never	1
w[ell]	1
well	0
i	0
kind	1
of	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
standard	1
but	1
i've	0
never	1
owned	0
one	1
so	0
i	0
had[n't]	1
i	0
don't	0
drive	1
one	0
a	0
lot	1

right	1

so	1
i	0
don't	1
f[eel]	0
feel	0
comfortable	1
in	0
traffic	1
with	0
it	1

right	1

and	1
for	0
everything	1
i've	0
heard	1
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
easier	0
to	0
sell	1
an	0
automatic	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1

and	1
and	0
resale	1
value	1
is	0
really	1
important	0
to	0
me	1

that's	0
true	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1
me	0
too	1
that's	0
why	1
i	0
got	0
the	0
honda	1

yeah	0

hondas	1
have	0
great	1
resale	1
value	0

yeah	0

the	0
mazda	1
definitely	1
did	0
not	1
not	1
at	0
[laughter-all]	1
they're	1
worse	1
than	0
american	1
cars	0
i	0
think	1
or	0
just	1
as	0
bad	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
resale	1
goes	1

i	0
did	0
pretty	0
well	1
with	0
my	1
uh	1
regal	1
because	0
it	1
was	1
in	0
really	1
good	1
shape	1
but	0
it	0
still	1
looked	1
real	1
nice	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	1
interior	1
was	1
still	1
really	0
nice	1
there	0
[what'n/wasn't]	1
cracks	1
all	0
over	0
the	0
dash	1
board	0
and	0
stuff	1
an[d]	1

right	1

and	0
it	0
had	1
some	1
some	1
nice	0
features	1
so	0
i	1
ended	0
up	0
okay	1
with	0
the	0
buick	1

good	1

and	0
i	0
anticipate	1
the	0
same	0
thing	1
with	1
the	0
honda	1
whenever	0
i	0
decide	1
to	0
sell	1
it	0
course	0
i	0
may	0
never	1
sell	1
it	0

[laughter-right]	1

i	0
may	0
drive	1
it	0
till	0
it's	0
dead	1
but	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
that's	1
what	0
i	0
did	1
with	0
the	0
mazda	1
drive	1
it	0
till	1
the	0
till	0
the	0
clutch	1
went	0
out	1
and	0
the	0
wheels	1
fell	0
off	1
[laughter-so]	1

yeah	0

[laughter-so]	1
probably	1
what	0
i'll	0
do	0
again	1

yeah	0

but	0
i	0
really	1
like	1
the	0
hondas	1
i	1
like	0
foreign	0
cars	1
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	1

yeah	0

i	0
looked	1
at	0
the	0
mitsubishi	1
galant	1
i	1
was	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
four	1
door	0
car	1
having	0
driven	1
the	0
rx	1
seven	0
so	0
long	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
so	1
small	1
and	0
it's	0
really	1
impractical	1
so	0
i	0
wanted	1
something	0
with	0
a	0
real	1
trunk	1
and	0
four	1
doors	1
something	0
easy	1
to	0
get	0
in	0
and	0
out	1
of	0
and	0
i	0
looked	1
at	0
the	0
galant	1
and	1
those	1
were	1
really	1
nice	1
and	1
you	0
can	0
get	1
them_1	1
for	0
a	0
great	1
price	1

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
found	1
it	0
hard	1
to	0
deal	1
with	0
the	1
dealership	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
through	0

oh	1

so	1
that's	0
how	1
i	0
ended	1
up	0
with	0
a	0
honda	1

i	0
wasn't	1
even	0
looking	1
for	0
a	0
car	1
when	0
i	1
bought	1
this	0
car	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
thinking	1
about	0
buying	1
a	0
prelude	1
from	0
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	0
moving	1
to	0
new	0
york	1
or	0
something	1
so	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
gonna	1
sell	0
her	0
car	1
because_1	0
she	0
didn't	0
need	1
it	0
anymore	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
only	1
like	0
a	0
year	1
old	1
and	0
i	1
had	0
never	0
driven	1
uh	0
a	0
prelude	1
so	0
i	0
went	1
to	0
a	0
dealership	1
because	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
uh	0
the	0
same	1
year	1
and	0
same	1
model	0
of	0
prelude	1
on	0
their	0
used	1
car	1
lot	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
test	1
drove	1
it	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
just	0
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
this	0
brand	1
new	1
white	1
prelude	1
you	0
know	1
two	1
liter	0
si	1
with	0
the	1
the	0
sun	1
roof	1
and	0
the	0
moon	1
roof	1
and	1

oh	1
yeah	0

they're	0
nice	1
i	0
think	1

and	1
i	1
i	0
bought	1
it	0
loaded	1

oh	1
yeah	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
loaded	1
i	1

i	0
mean	1

i	1
i	0
love	1
all	0
those	1
little	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
[laughter-don't]	0
need	1
but	0
they're	1
so	0
wonderful	1

yeah	0
i	0
went	1
there	1
looking	0
at	0
a	0
used	1
car	1
and	0
two	0
days	1
later	1
i	0
bought	1
this	0
car	1
i	1

i	0
felt	1
i	0
felt	1
like	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
worst	1
impulse	1
that	1
w[as]	0
that	1
was	0
the	0
largest	1
impulse	0
buy	1
i	0
had	1
ever	0
made	1
the	1

the	1
oth[er]	0
the	0
two	1
other	0
things	1
that	0
i've	0
bought	1
on	0
impulse	1
are	0
vcr	1
and	0
a	0
[laughter-washer]	1
and	0
dryer	1

i	0
would	0
[laughter-say]	1

i	0
go	1
for	0
the	0
big	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
i	0
noticed	1
mine	1
was	0
definitely	1
not	0
impulse	1
i	0
really	1
needed	0
a	0
new	0
car	1
mine	1
was	0
just	1
it's	0
getting	1
worn	1
out	0
i	0
guess	1
from	0
being	1
a	0
sports	0
car	1
i	0
drove	1
it	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	1
got	0
it	0
right	1
after	0
high	0
school	1
so	0
by	0
the	0
time	1
i	0
traded	1
it	0
in	1
it	1
was	0
[laughter-ready]	1

yeah	1
i	0
got	1
i	0
got	1
my	0
buick	1
as	0
a	0
high	1
school	0
graduation	0
gift	1

ready	1
to	0
[laughter-go]	1

did	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
this	0
[what'n/wasn't]	1
really	1
an	0
impulse	1
i	0
mean	0
buying	1
it	0
right	1
then	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
right	1
quickly	1
was	0
kind	1
of	0
impulsive	1
but	0
i'd	1
been	0
thinking	1
about	0
buying	1
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
three	1
years	0
and	0
i	0
was	1
just	0
scared	1
to	0

right	1

i	0
was	0
scared	1
to	0
start	0
taking	1
on	0
payments	1
because	0
the	0
buick	1
was	0
long	1
since	0
paid	1
for	0

right	1
that's	0
same	1
with	0
me	1
would	0
you	1
ever	0
buy	1
a	0
used	0
car	1
for	1
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
yourself	1

buy	0
a	1
buy	1
buy	1
a	0
used	0
car	1

like	1

right	1

sure	1

i	1
i	0
was	1
going	0
to	0
buy	1
one	0
once	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
worry	1
about	1
who's	0
driven	1
them_1	0
and	0
what	0
they've	1
been	0
through	1
and	0
the	0
warranties	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
just	1

yeah	0

just	1
i	0
can't	1
seem	0
to	0
get	1
over	0
that	1
that	0
just	1
bothers	0
[laughter-me]	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
why	1

well	1
um	0
like	1
on	0
hondas	1
they	1
supposedly	1
the	0
maintenance	1
records	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
registered	1
with	0
honda	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
you	1
can	0
request	1
whatever	0
maintenance	1
records	1
exist	1
on	0
cars	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
have	1
them_1	0
checked	1
out	0
by	0
mechanics	1
and	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

mean	0
they	0
can't	1
stop	1
you	0
from	0
doing	1
it	0
so	0

hoping	1
that	0
they	0
do	1
go	0
to	0
a	0
honda	1
dealership	1
to	0
get	0
them_1	0
serviced	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

well	1
and	0
even	1
if	0
they	0
didn't	1
you	0
can	0
still	1
get	0
a	0
good	0
idea	1
from	0
a	1
if	0
you	0
can	0
get	1
a	0
good	0
mechanic	1
to	0
check	1
it	0
over	0
real	0
carefully	1
and	0
check	1
the	0
blocks	1
and	0
everything	1

yeah	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

well	1
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
all	1

okay	1
well	0
i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	1
to	0
you	1

i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	0
to	0
you	1

bye-bye	1

bye-bye	1

okay_1	1
so	1
what	1
are	1
what	1
are	0
your	1
views	1
o[n]	1
on	0
capital	1
punishment	1

i	1
have	1
ambivalent	1
feelings	1
because	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
it	1
serves	1
as	1
a	0
kind	1
of	1
deterrent	1
we	0
would	1
like	0
to	0
think	1
it	1
is	0
but	1
on	1
the	0
other	0
hand	1
it	0
is	0
very	1
very	1
expensive	0
to	1
maintain	1
you	1
know	0
texas	1
has	0
one	0
of	1
the	0
biggest	1
criminal	1
justice	0
systems	0
in	1
the	0
country	0

yes	1

and	0
it's	0
eating	1
us	0
alive	1
budget	1
wise	0
and	0
um	0

so	1
are	0
they	1
currently	1
practicing	1
capital	0
punishment	1
in	0
your	1
state	1

yes	1
we	1
do	1
practice	1
capital	0
punishment	1

but	1
the	1
nature	1
of	0
the	1
uh	0
courts	1
and	0
the	0
appeals	1
and	1
the	0
stays	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
means	0
that	1
it's	1
a	0
very	1
long	1
haul	0
before	0
anybody's	0
ever	0
executed	0

yes	1
that's	0
similar	1
to	0
georgia	1

yeah	0
and	0
then	1
i	1
was	1
reading	1
in	0
the	1
paper	1
just	0
this	0
morning	1
it's	0
interesting	1
because_1	1
i	0
had	1
forgotten	1
i	0
guess	1
that	0
i	0
wrote	1
this	1
little	1
topic	0
down	1
that	1
it	0
costs	1
more	1
to	1
execute	1
somebody	1
tha[n]	0
than	0
it	0
does	1
to	0
keep	1
them_1	0
because	1
of	0
all	0
the	0
costs	1
of	0
the	0
appeals	1
and	0
all	1
that	0
you	0
know	0

that's	0
probably	0
true	1
considering	0

yes	1

yes	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
in	1
a	0
way	1
that	0
it	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
defeats	0
the	1
purpose	1
of	0
having	1
capital	1
punishment	1
if	0

well	0
i	0
think	1
capital	0
punishment	0
is	0
supposed	1
to	0
be	0
primarily	1
a	0
deterrent	1
to	0
other	0
people	1
you	0
know	1
who	0
would	1
see	1
it	0

yes	1

right	1
that	1
would	0
be	1
the	1
intent	1
of	0
it	1

yeah	1
but	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
how	1
successful	1
that	1
is	1

well	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
would	1
be	0
more	0
successful	1
if	1
it	0
was	0
applied	1
in	0
a	0
more	0
expedient	0
manner	1
if	1
there	0
weren't	1
so	0
many	1
appeals	1

quicker	1
maybe	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
if	0
if	1
the	1
person	1
who's	0
gonna	0
commit	1
the	0
crime	1
knew	1
that	0
they	0
were	0
gonna	0
be	1
punished	0
severely	1
possibly	0
capital	1
punishment	1

um-hum	0

what	0
what	1
kind	0
of	0
work	1
do	0
you	0
do	0

uh	0
i'm	1
a	1
research	1
engineer	1
i	0
work	1
uh	1
f[or]	0
with	0
georgia	1
tech	1

hum	0
well	1
see	0
i'm	1
a	0
school	1
principal	1

um	1

elementary	1
school	1

yes	1

and	0
in	1
a	0
very	1
poor	1
section	0
of	0
town	1
with	0
pr[edominantly]	0
predominantly	1
anglo	1
kids	1
and	0
i	1
see	0
kids	0
already	1
that	1
are	0
gonna	0
be	1
criminals	1
in	0
spite	1
of	0
everything	1
we	0
can	0
do	1

hum	0

and	1
see	0
i'm	1
afraid	0
i	1
think	0
if	0
we	0
would	0
take	0
the	0
equivalent	1
amount	0
of	0
money	0
and	0
invest	1
it	0
in	0
young	1
people	0
that	0
i	0
mean	1
course	0
you	0
couldn't	0
do	1
that	0
because_1	0
you	0
got	1
to	0
do	0
something	0
with	0
the	0
ones	0
that	0
are	0
already	0
there	1

um-hum	0

but	0
i	0
think	1
if	0
we	0
would	0
make	0
a	0
bigger	1
investment	1
in	0
kids	1
we'd	0
have	0
fewer	1
decisions	1
to	0
make	1
down	0
the	0
road	1
you	0
know	1

um	0
that's	0
probably	0
true	1
but	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	0
other	1
factors	0
that	0

oh	1
yeah	0

but	0
pu[mping]	1
pu[mping]	1
pumping	1
more	0
money	0
into	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
is	0
a	0
good	1
thing	0
but	0

well	1
i'm	1
not	0
talking	0
about_1	0
just	1
in	0
the	0
school	1
system	0

but	0
it's	0
not	1
gonna	0

oh	0
i	0
see	1

see	0
i'm	1
talking	0
about_1	0
like	0
in	0
in	0
uh	0
i'm	1
afraid	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
kids	1
who	0
just	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
taken	0
out	0
of	0
their	0
homes	1
and	0
reared	1
uh	0
i	0
know	0
institutions	1
don't	0
work	0
that	0
well	1
but	0
it's	0
a	0
bad	1
day	1
[laughter-because_1]	0
[laughter-because_1]	0
i	1
have	0
all	1
these	0
kids	0
through	0
my	0
office	1
i	1
have	0
a	0
school	0
of	0
five	0
hundred	1
and	0
thirty	0
seven	0
kids	0

um-hum	0

five	1
hundred	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
good	1
solid	0
kids	0
and	0
i	1
have	0
the	0
same	1
thirty	0
seven	1
in	0
my	0
office	0
every	1
day	0

um	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
their	0
parents	1
are	0
totally	1
irresponsible	1
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
in	0
the	0
penal	1
system	0

so	0
that's	0
a	0
difficult	1
situation	1

and	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
just	0
see	0
those	1
kids	0
going	0
down	0
the	0
road	1
now	0
not	0
all	1
of	0
them_1	0
will	0
commit	0
offenses	1
that	0
have	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
capital	1
punishment	0
but	0
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
have	0
already	0
been	0
in	0
youth	1
centers	0
and	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	0
and	0

um	0

and	0
if	0
we	0
had	0
something	1
to	0
do	1
before	1
they	0
get	0
to	0
be	1
full	1
blown	0
adult	0
criminals	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
talking	0
about_1	0
necessarily	0
in	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
that	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
should	0
be	1
the	0
agent	0
of	0
all	1
the	0
social	0
action	1

um-hum	0

i	1
think	0
that's	0
one	1
reason	0
we	0
have	0
problems	1
in	0
school	0
sys[tems]	0
uh	0
and	1
some	0
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
our	1
problems	0
but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it's	0
because	0
everything	0
society	0
wants	1
we're	1
supposed	0
to	0
do	1

um-hum	0

but	0
that's	1
another	0
subject	0
but	0

well	0
that's	1
probably	0
true	1
wh[at]	0

anyway	1
i	1
dealt	0
with	0
two	0
or	0
three	0
kids	0
today	1
that	0
are	0
gonna	0
end	0
up	1
where	0
somebody	1
has	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
decision	1
what	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
them_1	0

hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
not	0
an	0
easy	0
solution	1
there's	0
there's	0
no	0
easy	0
solution	1
for	0
that	1

um-hum	0

i	1
don't	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
there	0
is	1
an	0
easy	0
solution	0
but	0
if	1
you	0
could	0
find	1
a	0
way	0
to	0
prevent	1
some	0
of	0
it	0
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
what	0
it	0
would	0
be	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
money	1
better	0
spent	1
than	0

um-hum	0

do	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
costs	1
more	1
to	0
keep	0
an	0
inmate	1
on	0
death	0
row	1
than	0
it	0
does	0
to	0
send	0
a	0
kid	0
to	0
harvard	1

that's	0
true	1

i'm	0
sure	0
it	0
is	1
yeah	1

statistically	1
that's	0
true	1

hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
certainly	1
capital	0
punishment	0
isn't	0
gonna	0
solve	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
problems	1
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0

are	0
you	1
for	0
it	0

uh	0

i'm	1
for	0
it	0
in	0
in	0
some	1
cases	1

i	0
guess	1
i	0
am	1
for	0
certain	0
cri[mes]	0
yeah	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
in	0
certain	1
crimes	0

what	0
kind	0
of	0
crimes	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
use	1
it	0
for	0

um	0
premeditated	1
murder	1
crimes	0
of	0
that	1
nature	0
i	0
think	0
should	0
definitely	1

um-hum	0

any	0
mass	1
murderer	1
type	0
individual	0

i	1
i	1
would	0
consider	1
it	0
for	0
sexual	1
abuse	0
of	0
children	1
on	1
going	0
you	1
know	0
not	1
one	0
instance	0

into	0

but	1
uh	0
he	1
didn't	0
carry	0
any	0
ties	1
or	0
anything	0
because	0
he	0
he	1
just	0
went	1
over	1
there	0
with	1
the	0
that	1
attitude	1
that	1
well	0
if	0
i	0
don't	1
take	1
it	1

they	1
won't	0
make	0
me	1
wear	1

that's	1
true	1
that's	0
a	0
good	1
idea	0

because_1	0
uh	1
he	1
just	0
he	1
didn't	0
you	1
know	1
he's	1
not	1
really	1

blue	1
jeans	0

and	0
also	1
uh	0
to	0
get	1
off	0
the	0
clothing	1
the	0

you	1
know	0
how	0
they	0
have	1
the	0
the	0
different	1
designated	0
areas	1
for	0
smokers	1
and	0
stuff	1
i	1

the	0
no	0

right	1

i	1
think	0
that's	0
great	1

yeah	0
and	0
if	0
you	0
happen	1
to	0
go	1
into	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
areas	1
that	0
is	1
a	0
smoke	0
smoke	1
area	1
and	0
you	0
don't	1
smoke	0
you	0
almost	0
strangle	1

oh	0
really	1
do	0
you	1
smoke	1

so	1
much	0
smoke	1
in	0
the	0
air	1
yeah	1
areas	0
the	0
smoking	1
area	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
closed	1
in	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
if	0
you	1
don['t]	0
if	0
you	0
don't	1
smoke	0
and	0
you	0
go	0
in	1
there	0
tha[t]	0
everybody	1
that	1
goes	0
in	1
there	0
smokes	1
so	1
it's	0
full	1
of	0
smoke	1
when	0
when	1
you	1
go	0
in	0
there	1
i	0
used	1
to	0
smoke	1
a	0
long	0
time	0
ago	1

i	0
think	1
that's	0
um	0

i	0
used	0
to	0
burn	1
my	0

i	0
used	0
to	0
burn	1

best	1
way	0

the	0
price	1

reason	0
why	1
they're	0

so	0
that	0
that	1
has	0
a	0
lot	1

wa[s]	0
it	0

just	0
plain	1

uh	0
necked	1
uh	0
sw[eater]	0

um	0
some	1
othe[r]	0
other	1
little	0
things	1
on	0
it	0
and	0
i	0

and	0
i	0
go[t]	0
i	0
got	1
it	0
at	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
price	1
i	0
think	0
maybe	1
it	0
was	0
nine	1
ninety	0
nine	1
or	0
something	0

oh	1
that's	0
great	1

and	1
it	0
was	0
so	1
pretty	1
and	1
after	0
i	0
wore	1
it	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
times	1
i	0
realized	1
why	1
[laughter-it]	0
[laughter-was]	0
why	1
it	0
was	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1

huh	0
oh	1

there	0
was	0
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
the	0
back	1
of	0
it	0
there	1
was	0
it's	0
like	1
there	0
it	1
had	0
been	0
slit	1
and	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
just	0
sewed	1
it	0
back	1
together	1
right	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
[laughter-the]	0
the	0
back	1
you	0
know	0
wasn't	0

oh	1
no	1

wasn't	0
a	0
seam	1
or	0
anything	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
that's	1
why	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1
although	1
it's	0
not	1
it's	0
not	1
really	1
noticeable	1
um	0
from	1
the	0
outside	1
but	0
but	0
still	1
it's	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
really	0
not	1
not	0
not	1
a	0
good	0
quality	1

and	0
then	1
i	0
was	0
told	1
by	0
somebody	1
that	0
works	1
for	0
jc	0
penney's	1
that	0
um	0
ross	1
ross	1
is	0
just	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
places	1
that	0
sell[s]	0
sells	0
seconds	1

the	0
defect	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
um	0
they	0
don't	1
really	0
buy	1
the	0
first	0
quality	1
they	0
buy	0
the	0
[laughter-second]	1
and	1
uh	0
places	1
like	0
jc	0
penney's	1
that	0
they'll	0
reject	1
the	0
seconds	0
they'll	0
send	0
them	0
back	1
every	0
time	1
but	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
places	1
like	0
ross	1
dress	1
for	0
less	1
and	0
uh	0
tj	1
max	1

tj	1
max	1
does	0
that	0
yeah	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
we	1
have	0
a	0
tj	0
max	0
over	0
here	1
and	0
um	0

well	1
what	1
would	0
you	1
have	1
at	1
a	1
dinner	1
party	1

well	1
uh	1
lately	1
since	1
i	1
have	1
children	1
i've	1
cut	1
down	1
on	1
having	1
dinner	1
parties	1
but	1

uh-huh	1

but	1
when	1
i	0
do	1
i	1
try	1
to	1
keep	1
it	0
pretty	1
simple	1
on	0
things	1
that	1
i	0
can	1
prepare	1
ahead	1
of	0
time	1
uh	0
i	1
have	0
one	1
recipe	0
for	1
uh	1
a	0
really	1
good	1
um	1
type	1
of	0
a	0
meatball	1
it's	0
called	1
burgundy	1
meatballs	1
and	1
it's	0
made	1
with	0
r[ed]	0
red	1
wine	1
and	1
um	0

oh	1
gosh	1
that	1
sounds	0
great	1

um	0

it's	0
it's	0
really	1
good	0
and	1
you	0
can	0
make	1
it	0
ahead	1
of	1
time	1
and	0
then	1
um	0
make	1
the	1
sauce	1
when	1
you're	1
ready	1
to	1
um	1
to	1
serve	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

that's	1
one	0
of	0
my	1
favorite	0
things	1
to	0
to	0
serve	1

well	1
um	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
would	0
probably	1
depend	1
on	0
whether	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
formal	1
or	1
informal	1
dinner	1
party	1

sure	1

but	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
informal	1
my	1
first	1
choice	0
would	0
be	0
crawfish	1

oh	0
really	1
well	1
i	0
guess	1
being	0
from	1
that	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1

because	1
i	1
mean	0
crawfish	1
everybody	1
over	0
here	1
likes	0
crawfish	1
but	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
have	1
to	0
worry	1
about	0
satisfying	1
my	1
guest	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
if	1
it	1
was	0
a	1
formal	1
uh	0
dinner	0
party	1
i	0
would	0
probably	1
think	0
of	0
something	1
else	1
like	0
um	0
shrimp	1
shrimp	1
fettucini	1
is	0
real	0
easy	1
to	0
um	0
make	1
and	0
everything	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
it's	1
usually	0
well	0
liked	1
by	0
people	1
i	0
guess	0
i'm	1
just	0
a	0
seafood	1
fan	1
so	0
i	0
think	1
on	0
the	0
lines	1
oh	1

well	1
how	0
do	1
you	1
make	1
how	1
do	1
you	0
you	1
cook	1
crawfish	1
i	0

i	0
in	1
fact	1
i	1
just	0
came	1
back	1
from	1
the	0
grocery	1
store	1
and	1
being	1
in	0
texas	1
we	0
don't	1
have	0
too	1
many	0
you	1
know	0
people	1
that	1
that	1
eat	1
crawfish	1
but	1
they	1
had	0
live	1
crawfish	1
on	0
sale	1

oh	1
yeah	1
um	1

um	1
you're	1
not	1
supposed	1
to	0
i	1
mean	1
you're	1
not	1
supposed	1
to	1
eat	1
them_1	0
dead	1
i	0
mean	1
well	1
you	0
eat	1
them_1	1
dead	1
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0

don't	1
buy	1
them_1	0
that	0
way	1

right	1
because_1	1
if	0
if	0
they're	1
dead	1
for	1
too	0
long	1
you	0
can	0
always	1
tell	1
whenever	1
they're	0
cooked	1
if	1
they've	0
been	1
dead	1
for	0
a	1
long	1
time	1
because_1	0
their	1
tail	1
straightens	1
out	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
you're	0
not	1
supposed	0
to	1
eat	1
those	0
because_1	1
they're	0
the	0
bad	1
for	1
you	1

okay	1
well	1
i'll	0
remember	1
that	0

yeah	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
go	0
in	1
a	1
restaurant	1
and	1
order	1
crawfish	1
i	0
mean	1
every	0
once	1
in	1
a	0
while	1
you'll	1
see	1
o[ne]	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
doesn't	1
happen	0
very	0
often	1
because	0
it's	0
just	0
an	0
accident	1
but	0
if	0
the	0
tail	1
is	0
straight	1
on	0
it	0
then	0
yeah	1
don't	0
eat	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
um	0
you	0
just	1
put	1
some	0
cajun	1
well	0
lots	1
of	0
pepper	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
you	0
just	1
boil	1
them	0
and	1
they're	1
absolutely	1
wonderful	1
but	0
there's	1
uh	0
they're	0
a	0
pain	1
to	0
peel	1
for	0
some	1
people	0
once	1
you	0
get	0
used	1
to	0
it	0
they're	0
real	0
easy	1
but	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	1
have	0
nails	1
or	0
anything	0
you	0
can	1
plan	1
on	0
those	0
being	0
shot	1

when	0
you	0
were	1
um	0
whe[n]	1
when	0
you	1
serve	1
it	0
do	0
you	1
shell	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
serve	1
them	0
to	1

i	0
think	1
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	1
i	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
it	0
depends	1

um-hum	1

like	1
if	0
like	1
my	1
age	0
if	0
there	1
was	0
a	0
bunch	0
of	0
college	1
kids	1
coming	1
over	0
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	0
no	0
i	1
they	0
would	0
shell	1
their	0
own	1
you	1

sure	1

you	1
know	0
we'd	1
just	0
have	0
crawfish	1
and	0
beer	1
or	0
something	1
but	1
um	0
if	1
it	0
was	0
more	0
formal	1
like	1
if	0
i	0
was	0
you	0
know	1
working	1
environment	1
then	0
i	0
would	0
probably	1
um	0
sh[ell]	0
shell	1
them_1	0
or	0
at	0
least	1
disconnect	1
them	0
from	0
the	0
head	1
but	0
there's	1
a	0
there's	0
a	0
big	0
thing	1
over	0
here	1
that	0
everybody	1
sucks	0
the	0
head	1

so	0
they	1
don't	0
have	0
see	1
that	0
ooh	1

so	1
um	0
it	0
it	0
would	1
just	0
depend	1
that's	1

that's	1
the	0
best	0
part	1
of	0
the	0
crawfish	1

sucking	1
the	0
head	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
i[t]	0
it	0
just	0
depended	1
on	0
what	0
type	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
guess	1
but	0
you	1
can	0
buy	1
uh	0
the	0
crawfish	1
tails	1
already	0
peeled	1
an[d]	0
everything	1
and	0
usually	1
you	0
use	0
those	1
like	1
for	0
frying	1
or	1
to	0
put	1
in	0
salads	1
or	1
to	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
make	0
a	0
sauce	1
with	0
or	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0
you	1
can	0
go	0
ahead	0
and	0
buy	1
them_1	0
cooked	1
and	0
shelled	1
and	0
they're	1
more	0
expensive	1
of	0
course	1
but	1

does	1
it	0
taste	1
a	0
lot	1
like	0
shrimp	1

um	0
yeah	1
it	0
really	0
does	1
i	0
like	1
shrimp	0
better	1

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

just	1
um	0
but	0
crawfish	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
just	0
has	0
a	0
taste	1
of	0
its	0
own	1
it	0
also	1
depends	1
on	0
who's	1
cooking	1
it	0
and	0
how	0
much	0
seasoning	1
they	0
use	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	1
that	0
but	0

sure	1

but	0
um	0
i	1
think	0
that	1
and	0
also	1
to	0
get	1
totally	1
off	0
c[rawfish]	0
the	0
subject	1
of	0
crawfish	1
lots	1
of	0
vegetables	1
and	0
hors	0
d'oeuvres	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
that	0
really	0
helps	1

yeah	1
we	1
have	0
a	0
a	0
friend	1
another	0
couple	0
where	1
the	0
husband	1
is	0
the	0
one	0
who	0
cooks	1
all	1
the	0
time	1

and	1

that's	0
what	0
i	1
need	1

yeah	1
that's	0
what	0
i	1
wish	0
i	0
had	1
but	1
in	0
our	1
family	1
i'm	0
the	0
one	1
who	1
who	0
cooks	1
and	1
i	1
i	1
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
it's	1
gotten	1
a	1
little	0
more	0
difficult	1
with	0
kids	1
but	1
i	1
really	1
do	0
enjoy	0
cooking	1
and	0
we	1
um	1
we	1
have	0
them	1
over	1
for	0
dinner	1
back	1
and	0
forth	1
quite	0
a	0
lot	1
and	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
before	0
i	0
had	1
my	0
second	1
child	1
we	0
sort	0
of	0
had	0
a	0
contest	1
going	0
where	1
you	0
know	0
he	1
would	0
cook	1
and	0
then	0
the	0
next	1
time	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
my	1
turn	1
and	0
i'd	0
try	0
to	0
outdo	1
him	1
and	0
then	0
he'd	0
try	1
to	0
outdo	0
me	1
and	0

oh	1

and	0
we	0
we	1
was	0

was	0
really	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
and	0

i	0
bet	0
that	1

and	0

that	1
that	0
got	0
pretty	1
competitive	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
who	1
could	0
come	0
up	0
with	0
the	0
best	1
recipe	1

yeah	1
it	1

it	1
did	1
and	1

we	1
we	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
fancier	1
or	0
more	0
courses	1
than	1
the	0
other	1
or	1

that	1

don't	0
know	1
if	0
we	0
have	0
enough	1
time	1
for	0
it	0
it's	0

oh	1

it's	0
real	1
easy	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
unique	1
things	1
in	0
this	0
like	0
a	0
pound	1
of	0
ground	0
beef	1
some	0
bread	0
crumbs	1
um	0
an	0
egg	1
um	0
um	0

seasoning	1
usually	0
just	0
light	1
seasonings	1

yeah	1

seasonings	1
like	0
salt	1
and	0
pepper	1
um	0
and	0
chopped	1
up	0
water	1
chestnuts	1
which	0
is	0
something	1
different	1
um	0

oh	1

that	0
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1

makes	1
them	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
crunchy	1
you	0
need	1
to	0
chop	0
them_1	0
up	0
real	1
fine	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	1
it	0
makes	1
them	0
crunchy	1
and	0
that	0
adds	0
something	1
new	0
to	0
it	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
sauce	1
is	0
just	0
made	1
with	0
um	0
bouillon	1
cubes	1
water	1
burgundy	1
wine	1
and	1
um	0
cornstarch	1
instead	1
of	1
flour	1

um-hum	1

oh	1

so	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
thick	1
rich	1
type	0
of	0
a	0
sauce	1
it's	0
more	1
of	0
a	1
when	0
you	0
use	0
corn	1
starch	1
in	0
in	0
gravy	1
like	0
you	1
know	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
um	0
chinese	1
food	0
the	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
gravy	1
or	0
a	0
sauce	1
that	0
comes	0
with	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
they	0
use	0
corn	1
starch	0
instead	1
of	0
flour	1
in	0
all	1
of	0
their	0
sauces	1
and	0
gravies	1

um-hum	1

and	0
it	0
gives	1
it	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
different	1
consistency	1

well	0
um	0
how	0
long	1
do	0
you	1
cook	1
the	0
meatballs	1

the	0
meatballs	1
you	0
just	1
um	0
after	0
you	1
form	1
them	0
fry	1
them	0
in	0
a	0
pan	1
until	1
they're	1
uh	0
browned	1
on	0
all	1
all	0
sides	1
and	0

uh	0
huh	1

and	0
then	0
drain	1
off	0
all	0
the	0
grease	1
uh	0
then	1
what	0
i	0
usually	1
do	0
is	0
i	0
freeze	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you're	0
ready	1
to	0
serve	1
them	0
then	0
you	0
cook	1
the	0
sauce	1
and	0
then	0
put	0
the	1
meatballs	1
into	1
the	0
sauce	0
and	1
heat	1
it	0
probably	1

oh	1

you	0
have	0
to	0
heat	1
it	0
up	0
for	0
a	0
good	1
oh	1
if	0
they're	0
frozen	1
you	0
know	0
it	0
may	0

half	0
hour	1
for	0
them	0
to	0
thaw	1
out	0
but	0

heat	1
them	0
thoroughly	1
in	1
the	0
sauce	0
itself	1
let	0
them	1
simmer	1

the	0
sauce	1

there	0
anything	1
else	1

well	1
i	0
i	1
think	0

we've	0
covered	1
the	0
subject	1
i've	0
got	0
some	1
interesting	1
information	1
about	0
crawfish	1
i	0
was	1
in	0
fact	0
i	0

it's	0
good	1
cause	0
i	0
was	0
curious	1
about	0
that	0
today	1
when	0
i	0
saw	0
those	0
for	0
sale	1

oh	1
yes	1

yes	1
you	0
need	1
to	0
try	1
them_1	0
oh	0
they're	0
wonderful	1

oh	0
i	0
will	1
i'm	0
sure	0
my	0
husband	1
will	0
be	1
surprised	1
because_1	0
we	0
were	0
talking	1
about	0
them	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
even	0
before	1

uh	0
well	0
what	1
would	0
you	1
say	0
your	0
opinion	1
is	0
on	0
gun	0
control	1

well	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i've	1
i've	1
had	1
mixed	1
emotions	1
i	1
guess	1
when	1
i	1
listen	1
to	0
uh	1
the	1
radio	1
and	0
and	1
watch	0
tv	1
about	1
the	0
different	1
uh	0
things	1
that	0
are	0
happening	1
i	1
uh	1
i'm	1
against	1
it	1
but	1
on	0
the	0
same	1
token	1
um	1
i	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
purchased	1
a	1
gun	1
just	1
because	1
i	1
wanted	1
the	0
right	1
to	0
do	1
that	0

well	1

so	1
i	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
rifle	1
in	1
the	0
house	1
um	1
the	0
ammunition	1
is	0
probably	1
so	1
old	1
i'm	1
afraid	1
to	0
use	1
it	1
but	1
uh	1
i	0
bought	1
it	0
for	0
target	1
practicing	1
and	0
uh	1
and	0
also	1
because	0
i	1
wanted	1
a	1
weapon	1
uh	0
how	0
do	0
you	1
feel	1
about	0
it	0

well	1
i	1
think	1
uh	0
down	1
here	0
in	0
texas	1
they	1
don't	0
have	1
a	0
waiting	1
period	1
on	1
handguns	1

hm	0

and	0
i	1
think	1
they	0
need	1
that	1
uh	1
now	0
i	1
do	1
have	1
a	1
i	0
have	1
a	1
pistol	1
it's	0
a	1
little	0
twenty	1
two	1
and	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
twenty	1
two	1
or	1
a	0
twelve	1
gauge	1
shotgun	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
you	0
know	0
i	1
do	1
like	1
to	0
have	1
my	0
guns	1

uh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i'll	0
ever	1
use	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
and	1
like	0
you	1
my	0
bullets	1
to	1
my	0
little	0
pistol's	1
probably	1
uh	0
about	1
three	1
years	0
old	1
uh	1
my	1
gun	1
hasn't	0
been	1
shot	1
in	0
a	0
year	1
or	0
two	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
like	0
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
where	0
handy	0

well	1
up	1
uh	0
up	1
in	1
new	0
england	1
where	0
i'm	1
from	0
uh	0
y[ou]	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
get	0
a	0
permit	1
before	0
you	1
could	0
buy	0
any	1
ammu[n]it[ion]	1
amm[unition]	0
ammunition	1
and	1
i	0
thought	1
that	0
was	1
really	0
good	0
and	1
i	0
think	1
it	1
they	0
uh	0
takes	1

takes	1
two	1
weeks	1
for	0
that	0
system	1
to	0
process	1
um	0
your	1
request	1
for	1
uh	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
gun	1
permit	1
but	1
uh	1
but	0
to	1
buy	1
ammunition	1
you	1
have	1
to	0
get	1
a	0
p[ermit]	1
permit	1
from	0
the	1
police	1
station	1
in	1
your	1
local	1
area	0
to	1
do	1
that	0

i've	1
never	0
heard	1
of	0
anything	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0
um	1

that	0
would	0
be	1
nice	1
but	0
a[nd]	0
you	0
know	0

the	1
criminals	0
that	0
are	0
going	1
to	0
get	0
their	1
guns	1
one	1
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1

i	0
i	0
i	0
agree	0
i	0

i	0
think	1
you	0
know	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
that	0
that	0
needs	1
to	0
happen	1
is	0
uh	0
to	1
to	0
stop	1
the	0
impulse	1
buyer	1
from	0
um	0
buying	1
it	0
quickly	1
and	0
and	1
um	0
maybe	0
putting	0
a	0
week's	1
waiting	1
period	0
or	0
something	0
on	1
it	0
but	0

but	0
if	0
someone's	1
really	1
determined	1
to	0
to	1
pick	0
up	0
a	0
firearm	1
uh	0
you	0
can	0
pick	1
it	0
up	0
anyplace	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
you	1
can	0
get	1
them	1
really	1
cheap	1

i	1
know	1
i	1
i	1
uh	0
th[e]	0
i	1
had	1
a	0
waiting	1
period	0
on	0
my	1
pistol	1
because_1	0
i	1
was	0
down	0
in	0
uh	0
tennessee	1
and	1
uh	0
they	0
had	0
a	0
waiting	1
period	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
we	0
bought	1
it	1
there	1
and	0

how	0
long	1
was	1
the	1
waiting	0
period	0
out	1
there	0

about_1	0
nine	0
days	0

ah	0
that	0
wasn't	0
too	0
too	0
bad	0

no	0
no	0

because	0
i[f]	0
if	0
you're	0
gonna	1
go	0
buy	1
something	1
um	0
of	0
of	0
that	1
nature	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you're	0
gonna	1
have	1
some	1
idea	1
as	0
to	0
what	1
you're	0
gonna	0
do	1
with	0
it	0
you're	0
not	1
gonna	0
react	1

quickly	1
in	0

you	0
[d]on't	1
have	0
a	0
need	1
to	0

the	0
next	1
day	1

yeah	1
somebody	1
want	1
do	1
th[at]	1
i	1
i	1
at	0
times	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
ought	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
waiting	1
period	1
on	0
all	1
firearms	1

yeah	0
i	1
do	0
too	1
uh	0
because	1
[laughter-it]	0
doesn't	1
make	0
any	0
difference	1
uh	0
uh	0
whether	1
it's	0
a	0
pistol	1
or	0
a	1
shotgun	1
i	1
suppose	1
they	0
both	1
do	0
the	0
same	1
kind	0
of	0
job	1

shotgun	1
hurts	1
worse	1
than	0
a	0
pistol	1
does	0

uh	0
yeah	0
i	0
suppose	0
i'd	1
never	0
got	0
shot	1
with	0
either	0
one	1
but	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
um	1
i	1
think	1
you	0
could	0
recover	1
from	0
a	0
pistol	1
but	1
not	0
from	1
a	0
[laughter-shotgun]	1

a	0
shotgun's	1
got	0
too	1
much	0
of	0
a	0
spread	1
or	0
at	0
least	0
ours	0
does	0
uh	0

yeah	0

uh	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
little	1
uh	0
thing	1
on	0
the	0
bo[ttom]	0
bottom	1
of	0
th[e]	0
on	0
top	1
of	0
the	0
barrel	1
where	1
you	1
a[s]	0
you	0
turn	1
it	1

uh-huh	1

you	0
can	1
make	0
it	0
either	1
tight	0
or	0
[laughter-as]	1
loose	0
as	1
loose	0
can	1
get	0

oh	0

and	0
the	1
spread	0
changes	1

uh	0
i've	1
got	0
a	0
a	0
manual	1
singled	1
shot	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
doesn't	1
have	0
any	1
any	0
automatic	1
features	1
to	0
it	0
the	0
further	1
away	0
i	0
get	1
the	0
the	1
uh	0
wider	1
the	0
shot	1
gets	0
from	0
the	0
target	1

yeah	0

and	0
the	0
closer	0
that	0
i	0
get	0
the	0
tighter	0
that	0
it	0
gets	0
it's	0
got	1
a	0
hell	1
of	0
a	0
kick	1
to	1
it	0

yeah	0
my	0
husband	1
had	1
a	0
uh	0
a	0
police	1
gun	1
at	0
one	0
time	1
and	1
i	0
shot	1
that	1
thing	0
one	0
time	1
almost	0
knocked	0
me	0
down	1

it	0
was	0
just	1
a	1
little	0
i	0
don['t]	0
i	0
forget	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
three	1
fifty	0
seven	1
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0

do	0
you	0
belong	1
to	1
a	0
gun	1
club	1
or	0
you	0
uh	0

he	1
belonged	1
to	0
one	1
awhile	0
back	1
uh	0
since	0
we	0
mo[ved]	0
we've	1
only	1
been	0
here	1
in	0
texas	1
for	1
about	0
a	0
year	1

um-hum	0

uh	0
we	1
can't	1
even	0
find	1
a	0
place	0
to	0
shoot	1
just	1
for	1
target	1
practice	1

no	0
kidding	0

i'd	0
love	1
to	1
get	1
used	0
to	1
that	1
shotgun	1
we	1
traded	1
his	0
pistol	1
for	1
that	1
shotgun	1

huh	0
well	0
the	0
the	1
um	0
uh	0
clubs	1
that	0
we've	0
got	1
around	0
here	1
are	0
kind	1
of	0
expensive	1
but	0
uh	0
it's	0
well	1
worth	0
it	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
down	1
and	0
shoot	1
up	0
against	0
a	0
sand	1
bag	1
and	0
so[me]	0
targets	1
and	0
have	1
uh	0
competition	1
um	0
i've	1
never	1
really	0
joined	1
a	0
club	1
because	0
i	0
haven't	1
got	0
the	0
time	1
not	1
because	0
i	0
haven't	0
got	0
the	0
desire	1
uh	0
there's	0
an	0
annual	1
membership	1
fee	1
uh	1
that's	0
that's	1
fairly	1
high	1
plus	1
there's	0
initi[ation]	1
initiation	1
fee	0
that	1
you	1
have	1
to	0
pay	1
as	0
a	0
first	1
time	1
uh	0
uh	0
member	1

so	0
the	0
whole	1
process	1
can	0
cost	1
you	0
a	0
hundred	1
fifty	0
dollars	1
just	0
to	0
join	0
the	0
club	1
plus	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
ammunition	1
in	0
any	0
tournaments	1
that	0
you	0
would	1
join	1
in	0

yeah	0
well	0
that's	0
what	1
uh	1
my	0
husband	0
wh[en]	0
when	0
he	1
was	1
in	0
it	0
gun	1
club	0
when	0
they's	0
done	0
that	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
he	1
went	0
mostly	1
just	0
to	0
um	0
shoot	1
at	0
paper	1
targets	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
but	0
you	1
know	0
they	1
used	0
speed	1
and	0
accuracy	1
and	0
all	0
that	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
the	0
gun	1
clubs	1
serve	1
a	0
useful	0
purpose	1
in	0
fact	1
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
somehow	1
they	0
tie	1
the	1
legislation	1
into	0
not	0
only	1
when	0
you	0
buy	1
a	0
weapon	0
you	0
have	1
to	1
uh	0
show	1
that	0
you've	0
gone	0
to	0
school	1
or	0
gone	0
to	0
some	0
class	1
to	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
handle	1
that	0
weapon	0

that's	0
a	0
good	0
i've	1
never	0
thought	1
of	0
that	1

that's	1
a	0
good	1
point	1

and	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
it	1
even	1
a[fter]	0
after	1
you	0
wait	1
your	0
nine	0
days	1
if	0
you	0
don't	1
know	0
how	0
to	0
hand[le]	1
it's	0
just	1
like	0
putting	1
someone	0
in	0
an	0
automobile	1
that	0
doesn't	1
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
and	0
you	0
give	1
him	0
a	0
license	1
because	1
he	0
waited	1
nine	1
days	0

yeah	0
that	0
and	0
yeah	0

he	1
could	0
he	1
could	0
not	0
only	1
um	1
uh	0
shoot	1
himself	1
he	0
could	0
he	0
could	1
uh	0
mishandle	1
a	0
weapon	0
leave	1
it	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
let	0
a	0
child	1
get	0
at	1
it	0

and	0
well	0
we	1
uh	1
we	1
was	1
living	1
on	0
a	1
navy	1
base	1
down	0
in	0
memphis	1
and	0
uh	0
this	0
one	1
guy	0
decided	1
to	0
play	1
uh	0
lonesome	1
cowboy	1
or	0
something	1
and	0
he	1
was	0
twirling	1
his	0
gun	1
around	0
and	0
shot	1
himself	0
in	0
his	0
foot	1

wow	0
he	0
was	0
fortunate	0
he	0
[laughter-could]	1
[laughter-he]	0
[laughter-could]	0
[laughter-of]	0
[laughter-hit]	1
[laughter-something]	0
[laughter-else]	1

well	0
he	1
went	0
tumbling	1
down	0
the	0
steps	1
along	1
with	0
uh	0
shooting	1
his	0
foot	1
almost	0
off	1
he	0
broke	1
his	0
leg	1
and	0
a	0
collar	1
bone	1
and	0
couple	1
of	0
other	1
things	0
i'm	0
sure	1
being	0
mister	1
cowboy	1
i	0

wow	0

i	0
can't	1
remember	0
what	1
the	0
na[me]	0
term	1
was	0
going	1
around	0
it	0
was	0
about	0
four	1
to	0
five	1
years	0
ago	0

but	0
naw	1
th[e]	0
i	1
guess	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
good	1
idea	1

about_1	0
uh	0
private	1
citizens	1
selling	1
uh	0
weapons	1
like	0
if	0
you	0
wanted	1
to	0
sell	1
your	0
pistol	1
to	0
me	1
huh	0
how	0
do	0
you	1
feel	0
about	0
that	1
do	0
you	0
believe	1
there	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
legislation	1
guiding	1
the	0
um	0
buyer	1
and	0
the	0
seller	1
and	0
or	0
do	0
you	1
believe	1
that	0
you	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
sell	1
your	0
system	1
uh	0
because	0
you	0
own	1
it	0

uh	1
that's	1
a	0
hard	1
one	0
because_1	1
we	0
did	1
that	0
but	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
there	1
ought	0
to	0
be	0
some	1
rule	0
against	1
it	0
i'll	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
person	1
who	0
sells	1
the	0
gun	1
ought	1
to	0
protect	1
themself	1
because	1
if	0
that	1
gun's	0
registered	1
to	0
them	1
and	0
somebody	1
else	1
uses	0
that	0
gun	0
in	0
something	1
the	0
cops	1
are	0
gonna	1
come	0
to	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
is[n't]	0
isn't	1
there	0
a	0
way	1
to	1
um	0
to	0
deregister	1
yourself	0
after	0
you	0
register	1
a	0
gun	0

ah	0

i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	0
i've	1
only	0
had	1
one	1
gun	0
and	0

because	0
i	1
have	0

and	0
i've	0
kept	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
the	0
one	1
gun	0
that	0
was	0
in	0
my	1
name	1

yeah	0
is	0
it	1
registered	0

yeah	0
i	1

the	0
um	0
the	0
rifle	1
that	0
i've	1
got	0
is	0
not	1
registered	1

and	0
um	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
why	1
i	0
never	1
registered	0
it	0
but	0
the	0
uh	0

i	1
don't	0
think	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
register	1
a	0
shotgun	1

um	0
i'd	0
i'd	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
it's	0
voluntary	0
the	0
um	0
the	0

well	0
see	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	1
has	0
a	0
thing	1
if	0
they	1
go	0
to	0
uh	0
regulating	1
uh	0
all	1
right	0
uh	0
banning	1
guns	1
o[f]	0
pri[vate]	0
private	1
pri[vate]	1
private	1
ci[tizens]	0
citizens	1

yeah	0

this	0
my	1
kid	1
is	0
jumping	1
on	0
me	0
i	0
can't	1
hardly	0
talk	1

my	0
husband	1
feels	1
that	0
they'll	0
come	1
and	0
collect	1
everybody's	0
guns	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
that	0
could	0
happen	0
it's	0
just	0
like	1
the	0
uh	0
the	0
social	1
security	1
system	1
once	1
they	0
uh	0
they	0
gave	1
everybody	0
a	0
number	1
and	0
now	1
they're	0
making	1
you	1
um	0
uh	0
get	1
one	0
at	0
at	0
birth	1

and	0
once	1
they	0
have	1
your	0
number	0
they	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
your	0
identification	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
if	0
you	0
try	1
to	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
um	0
like	1
uh	0
not	0
identify	1
yourself	0
to	0
the	0
government	1
they	1
know	0
who	0
you	0
are	1

and	0
everything	0
about	0
you	0

and	0
that's	0
true	0

uh	0
i	0
bu[t]	0
you	0
know	0
they	0
know	1
it	0
from	0
how	0
much	1
money	1
you	0
make	1
a	0
week	1
to	1
uh	0
probably	1
your	1
uh	0
my	0
kid	0
is	0
banging	0
i	0
was	0
seeing	1
what	0
they	0
was	0
banging	1
on	0
uh	0
i've	1
lost	0
my	0
train	1
of	0
thought	1
i'm	0
sorry	0

that's	0
all	0
right	0
yeah	0
you	0
were	0
talking	1
about	1
uh	0
um	0
fed[eral]	1
what	1
the	0
federal	1
government	1
knows	1
about	0
people	1

oh	0
the	0
social	0

yeah	0
they	0
pr[obably]	0
they	0
probably	1
know	0
everything	1
from	0
half	1
the	0
time	1
wh[at]	0
ho[w]	0
what	0
time	1
you	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
bathroom	1

they	0
probably	0
do	0

no	0
that's	0
that's	0
a	0
little	0
bits	0
extreme	0
but	0
they	1
could	0
know	0
anything	1
and	0
everything	1
about	0
you	0
and	0
uh	0
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
have	1
my	0
gun	1
if	0
they	1
go	0
to	0
banning	1
banning	1
them_1	0
i'd	1
lose	0
my	0
gun	1
but	0
we	0
wouldn't	1
lose	0
our	0
pis[tol]	1
or	1
ou[r]	0
shotgun	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
we're	1
wanting	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
couple	1
more	1
that	0
no	1
one	0
knows	1
about	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
uh	0

do	0
you	0
find	1
it	0
difficult	1
picking	0
up	1
uh	0
guns	1
that	0
that	0
are	0
not	1
registered	1

naw	0

no	0
i	0
don't	0
either	0
i	1
can	0
i	1
can	0
buy	1
some	0
uh	0
today	1
if	0
i	0
wanted	1
to	0
just	0
you	0
know	0
put	0
up	0
the	0
money	0

yeah	0
w[ell]	0

yes	0
well	0
you	1
can	0
look	0
in	0
the	1
uh	0
the	0
we	1
got	1
the	0
thing	1
down	0
here	0
called	0
a	0
shopper	1

uh-huh	0

it's	0
a	0
a	0
who	1
a	0
it's	0
a	0
it's	0
a	0
bargain	1
thing	1
uh	0
you	0
go	1
and	0
everyb[ody]	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
always	1
see	0
guns	1
in	0
there	0
five	0
to	0
seven	0
guns	0
a	0
day	0

yeah	0

it	0
comes	1
out	0
every	0
tuesday	1

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
no	0
waiting	1
period	1
on	0
that	1

naw	0
[laughter-none]	0
whatsoever	0

you	0
ca[n]	0
call	0
w[e]	0
we	1
sold	0
a	0
refrigerator	1
through	1
it	0
and	1
it	0
took	1
us	0
all	1
of	0
twelve	1
hours	0

you	0
sell	0
the	0
refrigerator	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i'm	0
sure	1
it'd	0
be	0
even	1
less	0
for	0
somebody	1
with	0
a	0
good	1
gun	1

hm	0
yeah	0
i	0
think	1
the	0
federal	1
government	1
is	0
um	0
is	0
really	1
far	1
away	1
from	0
uh	0
um	0
control	1
i	1
i	0
don't	1
believe	1
in	0
um	0
should	0
i	0
shouldn't	1
probably	1
say	0
control	1
i	0
mean	0
regulation	0
control	1
is	0
something	0
that	0
i	0
wouldn't	1
want	0
the	0
federal	1
government	1
to	0
have	1
b[ut]	0
um	0
but	0
i	0
would	1
like	0
to	0
see	1
them	0
have	1
a	0
monitoring	1
capability	1
so	1
that	0
they	0
know	1
who	1
has	1
what	0
weapons	1

yeah	0
well	0
i'll	0
agree	1
with	0
you	0
there	1
they	0
do	1
have	0
too	1
much	0
control	1
over	0
us	0
already	1

yeah	0

uh	0
we	1
could	0
look	0
at	0
our	0
paychecks	1
and	0
see	1
how	0
much	0
control	1
they	0
have	1

unfortunately	1
we	1
uh	0
we	0
vote	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
people	1
who	0
spend	1
the	0
money	1
so	0
i	0
can't	1
complain	1
too	1
much	0

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
they're	0

anyway	1
what	1
are	0
your	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
first	1
comments	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1

uh	1
my	1
first	1
comments	1
on	1
the	1
budget	1
i	0
would	1
say	1
there	0
has	1

what	1
would	0
you	1
start	1
cutting	1
f[irst]	0
what	1
would	0
be	1
the	0
first	1
thing	1
you'd	0
cut	1
defense	1

surprisingly	1
no	1
i	0
would	1
i	1
would	0
cut	1
the	0
prison	1
systems	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
self-support	1

mean	0
private	1
enterprise	1

hm	1

have	1
private	1
enter[prise]	1
enterprise	1
do	1
it	1

you	1
mean	1
the	0
prisons	1

uh-huh	1
they're	1
already	0
talking	1
about	0
it	1
i	1
mean	1
they're	0
talking	1
about	1
um	1
having	1
it	1
uh	1
as	1
a	1
you	1
know	0
business	1
uh	0
to	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
to	0
so	1
the	1
you	0
know	1
the	0
government	1
doesn't	1
have	0
to	1
deal	1
with	0
it	0

i	1
hadn't	1
heard	1
that	1

but	0
uh	1
yeah	1
because	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
all	1
funded	1
either	1
state	1
or	1
federally	1
funded	1
so	1
or	1
uh	0
obvious[ly]	1
so	1

right	1

so	1
but	1
um	0
but	1
see	1
they're	1
they	1
don't	1
have	1
enough	1
um	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
there's	1
there's	0
not	1
enough	1
room	1
in	0
these	0
prisons	1
and	0
that	0
and	0
that	1
uh	0
to	0
continue	1
funding	1
it	0
they	0

but	1
to	0
me	1
well	0

they	0
think	1
they	0
need	1
to	0
maybe	1
have	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
private	1
you	1
know	0
business	1
private	0
enterprise	1
come	1
in	0
so	1

well	0
see	1
the	0
other	1
way	0
i'm	1
thinking	1
about	0
is	0
they	0
should	1
be	0
self-supporting	1
like	0
um	1
the	0
prisoners	1
make	1
license	1
plates	0
or	0
farm	1
or	0
small	1
industry	1
inside	1
the	0
prisons	1
anything	1
to	0
where	1
they	0
can	0
be	0
self-supporting	1
within	0
themselves	1
in	0
other	1
words	1
they're	1
in	1
there	0
for	0
a	1
purpose	1
put	1
them	0
to	0
work	1
rather	1
than	0
sitting	1
there	0

um-hum	1

it's	0
the	0
same	1
thing	0
like	1
the	0
whole	1
criminal	1
i	0
shouldn't	1
say	0
criminal	1
but	0
the	0
whole	0
police	1
department	1
of	0
the	0
united	0
states	1
i	0
feel	1
the	0
same	1
way	1
uh	0
someone	1
gets	1
picked	0
up	1
for	1
drunk	1
driving	1
he	1
should	1
put	1
enough	0
in	1
there	0
that	1
goes	0
back	1
into	1
paying	1
for	0
that	0
policeman	1
being	1
out	1
there	0

um-hum	1

so	0
it's	0
self	1
defen[se]	1
you	1
know	0
self-defense	1
on	0
that	0
point	1
um	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
my	0
defense	1
budget	1
uh	0
they're	0
cutting	1
it	0
back	1
now	1
what	0
twenty	1
five	0
percent	1
i	0
wouldn't	1
want	1
to	0
see	1
it	0
cut	1
any	1
more	1
than	0
that	1

yeah	1

but	0
again	1
i'd	0
like	0
to	0
see	0
something	1
on	1
the	0
other	1
end	1
back	1
into	0
education	1
but	0
not	1
in	0
the	0
education	1
we	0
have	0
today	1
so	1
i'm	1
lost	1
on	0
that	1
one	1
i	0
would	0
like	1
to	0
be	1
a	0
little	1
more	1
into	1
investigating	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
other	1
countries	1
in	0
the	0
world	1
and	1
their	1
educational	0
problems	1
and	0
to	0
come	0
up	1
with	0
something	1
a	0
little	0
better	1
than	0
what	1
we've	1
got	1

um-hum	1
yeah	1
its	0
tough	1
to	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
um	1
you	0
know	1
what	1
uh	0
as	0
far	1
as	1
this	1
that	1
good	1
or	0
bad	1
or	0
what	1
but	0
uh	1
i	0
was	0
just	1
talking	1
to	0
somebody	0
else	1
and	0
all	0
those	0
european	1
countries	1
they	0
pay	1
all	0
the	0
way	1
through	1
college	1
and	0
stuff	1
like	0
that	0
they	1
so	1
uh	0

well	1
not	1
so	0
much	0
pay	1
i'm	0
not	1
trying	1
to	0
see	0
the	0
government	0
put	1
out	0
any	0
more	1

no	1
yeah	1
i	0
know	1
what	0
you	0
are	0
saying	1
but	0
i'm	1
just	0
saying	1
that	0
even	1
the	0
differences	1
uh	0
is	1
that	1
you	1
know	0
some	0
countries	1
pay	1
for	0
students	1
to	0
go	1
to	1
through	1
college	1
and	0
etcetera	1
but	0
here	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
it's	0
just	0
up	1
to	0
high	1
school	0

yeah	1
but	0
see	1
we	1
don't	0
even	1
push	1
the	0
fact	1
to	0
the	0
high	1
school	0
kids	1
that	0
there's	0
other	1
means	1
of	0
education	1
out	0
there	1
rather	1
than	0
college	1
to	0
go	1
either	1
as	0
an	0
apprentice	1
which	1
they	1
they	0
do	1
in	0
other	1
countries	1
just	0
doing	1
this	0
which	0
i	1
think	1
would	1
bring	1
the	0
education	1
back	1
up	1
you	1
know	0
why	1

hum-um	1

why	1
not	0
an	0
apprentice	1
out	0
to	1
a	0
a	0
company	1
and	0
learn	1
from	0
down	1
on	0
the	1
bottom	1
as	0
a	1
wood	1
worker	1
or	1
you	1
know	0
just	0
a	0
technician	1
you	0
can	0
learn	1
on	0
the	0
job	1
which	1
of	0
course	1
again	1
which	1
m[ean]	0
would	0
mean	1
again	1
our	0

um-hum	1

our	0
education	1
budget	1
will	0
go	0
down	1
if	0
this	1
is	0
in	1
a	0
few	0
years	1
i	0
mean	1
it's	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
overnight	1

yeah	1

but	0
that	1
would	1
come	1
down	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
pro[gram]	1
you	1
know	0
that's	1
one	0
reason	1
uh	1
you	0
know	1
we	0
do	1
have	0
the	0
education	1
is	0
that	1
what	1
it	0
takes	1
for	1
these	0
companies	1
to	0
bring	1
somebody	0
on	0
board	1
uh	1
they're	1
not	1
willing	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
put	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
training	1
for	1
only	1
a	0
certain	0
amount	1
so	1

so	1
um	1
it's	1
you	1
know	0
as	0
far	0
as	1
the	0
technical	1
side	1
but	1
uh	0
even	1
like	1
one	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
biggest	1
things	0
now	1
is	0
like	1
paralegals	1
and	0
stuff	1
i	0
mean	0
they	1
they're	1
trying	1
to	0
get	0
more	0
people	1
into	0
that	1
field	1
but	0
they	1
can't	1
just	0
bring	1
somebody	0
in	1
without	1
even	0
having	1
gone	1
to	1
you	1
know	0
school	1
in	0
that	0
area	1
before	1
they	0
can	0
work	1
you	1
know	0
for	0
a	0
lawyer	1
as	0
a	0
paralegal	1

excuse	1
me	0
i	0
see	1
it	0
being	0
done	1
i	1
know	1
of	0
a	0
friend	1
that	0
works	0
for	0
my	1
lawyer	1
that	0
has	0
had	0
no	1
training	0
whatsoever	1
and	0
she's	1
training	1
her	0

um-hum	1
well	0
yeah	1
i	1
i'm	1
well	1
ye[ah]	0
i	1
you	1
know	0
i'm	0
assuming	1
that	0
it	0
can	1
be	0
done	1
uh	0
my	1
perspective	1
is	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
been	1
with	0
a	0
couple	1
of	0
big	0
companies	1
now	0
and	0
it's	1
like	1
they'd	1
are	0
unwilling	1
to	0
put	1
the	0
time	1
in	1
you	1
know	0
they	0
want	1
somebody	1
you	1
know	0
when	0
they	1
then	0
when	0
they	1
bring	1
them	0
off	1
bring	1
them	0
in	1
that	0
they	1
have	0
something	1
you	1
know	0
a	0
certain	1
amount	1
to	0
contribute	1
obviously	1
there's	0
uh	0
uh	0
you	1
know	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
to	0
learn	1
uh	0
after	0
that	1
but	1
but	1
uh	0
that's	1
true	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
um	0
you	1
know	1
businesses	1
are	0
small	1
you	1
know	0
small	1
businesses	1
that	0
could	1
uh	0
let	1
me	0
change	1
my	0
channel	1
i've	1
got	1
a	0
cordless	1
phone	1
let	0
me	0
see	1
if	0
that	1
clears	1
this	0
up	1
is	0
that	1
better	1

yes	1

okay	1

wow	1

an[d]	1
yeah	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
cordless	1
phone	1
and	0
all	1
of	0
a	0
sudden	1
we	0
had	1
a	0
bad	1
uh	0
frequency	1
there	0
or	0
something	1
so	1
we	0
had	1
some	0
interference	1
so	0
i	0
changed	1
that	0

yeah	1
it	0
sounded	1
you	0
were	0
calling	1
from	0
around	0
the	0
world	1
[laughter-somewhere]	1

anyway	1
so	1
um	0

we[ll]	1

but	0
uh	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
they	0
maybe	1
they	0
need	0
to	1
uh	0
help	1
promote	1
that	0
more	1
give	1
incentives	1
like	1
uh	0
if	0
they	0
do	1
bring	0
somebody	1
on	0
they	1
will	1
pay	1
some	0
of	0
their	0
costs	1
or	0
give	1
tax	1
breaks	0
or	0
whatever	1
it	0
is	0
you	0
know	1
for	0
them	1
to	0
train	1
people	0
you	1
know	0
stuff	1
like	0
that	1
programs	1
like	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
i	1

um-hum	1

i	1
don't	0
know	1
you	1
know	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0
options	1
they've	0
got	1

well	0
that's	1
something	1
about	0
what	0
germany's	1
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
doing	1
something	1
similar	1
to	0
that	0
right	0
now	1
and	1
uh	0
they	0
have	0
jobs	1
out	1
on	0
you	1
know	0
bulletin	1
boards	1
so	0
people	0
know	1
what	0
is	0
open	1
for	0
an	0
apprentices	1
in	0
different	0
fields	1
but	0
see	1
that	1
again	1
would	0
cut	0
some	1
of	0
our	0
budget	0
down	0
for	0
education	1
but	0
build	1
up	0
our	0
education	1
with	0
the	0
people	1
at	1
people	1
per	0
at	0
high	1
school	0
level	1
which	0
i	0
would	0
like	1
to	0
see	1
rather	1
than	0
so	1
many	0
kids	0
getting	0
out	0
of	0
school	1
they're	0

uh-huh	1

they're	0
they	0
go	1
on	0
the	0
unemployment	1
list	0
before	0
we	1
have	0
turn	0
around	1
because	0
they	0
don't	1
have	1
any	0
education	1

um-hum	1

i	0
don't	1
mean	0
college	1
and	0
i'm	1
for	0
college	1
but	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
that	0
don't	0
want	1
their	0
higher	1
education	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
quote	0
quote	0
college	1
is	0
concerned	1
they've	0
had	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
i	1
just	0
heard	1
something	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
it	1
was	0
like	0
only	1
it	0
was	0
either	0
sixty	1
percent	1
or	0
forty	1
percent	1
go	1
to	0
college	1
and	0
then	1
out	0
of	0
that	1
percentage	1
only	1
so	1
many	0
can	0
get	1
their	0
degree	1

um-hum	1

so	0
i	0
thought	0
that	1
was	0
interesting	1
but	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
most	1
people	0
i	1
knew	1
have	0
gone	1
and	0
got	0
their	0
degree	1
so	1

oh	1
yeah	1
but	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them	0
out	0
there	0
that	1
haven't	1

yeah	1
well	1
i	1
ju[st]	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
uh	0
was	1
basic	1
in	1
a	0
you	0
know	1
middle	1
upper	0
middle	1
class	1
area	1
and	1

that's	1

and	1
yeah	1
so	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
that	1
demographic	1
area	0
there	1
you	0
know	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them	1
do	1
go	0
on	1
and	1
they	0
go	1
to	0
college	1
etcetera	1

well	1
it	0
seems	1
to	0
me	1
that	0
kids	1
that	0
a[re]	0
get	1
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0
that	0
parents	1
have	0
gone	1
to	0
college	1
and	0
college	1
here	1
and	0
college	1
there	1
that	0
are	0
really	1
not	1
interested	1
in	0
going	1
to	0
college	1
and	0
forced	0
into	1
it	0
usually	1
are	0
your	0
drop	1
outs	0
where	1
if	0
they're	0
said	1
hey	1
it's	0
just	1
as	0
advisable	1
to	0
go	0
into	0
something	0
you	0
enjoy	1
and	0
you	1
like	1
because	0
you	1
can	0
get	1
just	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
being	1
a	0
journeyman	1
carpenter	1
or	0
an	0
electrician	1
or	0
plumber	1
or	0
anything	1
else	1
like	0
that	0
make	0
as	0
much	1
money	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
enjoy	1
it	0
more	1
they'll	1
make	1
a	0
lo[t]	1
happier	1
life	1
for	0
themselves	1

yeah	1

question	1
you	0
threw	1
that	0
question	1
on	0
me	1
about	0
the	0
deficit	1
put	0
it	1
on	0
your	1
shoe	0
now	1
what	1
would	0
you	1
do	1

well	1
as	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
deficit	1
that's	1
a	0
whole	1
nother	1
uh	1
my	1
perception	1
of	1
the	0
budget	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
government	1
and	0
they	1
have	0
so	1
much	0
to	0
spend	1
and	0
there's	1
not	1
enough	0
money	1
to	0
spread	0
around	1
but	0
the	0
deficit	1
basically	1
is	1
that	0
the	0
trade	1
surplus	0
between	1
the	0
other	0
countries	1
and	1
that	0
we	0
have	1
more	0
money	1
or	0
goo[ds]	1
you	0
know	1
more	0
money	1
going	0
out	1
and	0
too	1
many	0
goods	1
coming	0
into	1
this	0
country	1
you	0
know	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
part	1
of	0
that	1
problem	1
i	0
think	1
is	0
still	1
you	0
know	1
uh	0
like	0
japan	1
still	1
does	0
not	1
let	0
us	0
compete	1
fairly	1
in	0
their	0
country	1
and	1
and	0
obviously	1
the	1
the	0
demand	1
for	0
their	1
goods	1
is	0
quite	0
high	1
here	0
so	1
they	1
can	0
get	0
their	0
goods	1
in	0
here	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
start	1
even	1
that	0
out	1
we	0
need	1
to	0
continue	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
at	0
least	0
threaten	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
we're	0
going	1
to	0
give	1
them	0
higher	1
tariffs	1
etcetera	1
to	0
raise	1
their	0
prices	1
to	0
you	1
know	1
ours	1
but	1
um	0
it's	0
just	1
that	1
uh	0
they're	1
in	1
i	0
think	1
you're	1
you're	1
going	0
to	0
find	1
that	0
just	0
because	0
the	0
united	1
states	1
you	1
know	0
there	0
is	0
such	1
a	0
demand	1
here	0
the	0
market	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
uh	0
uh	0
the	0
mon[ey]	1
you	0
know	0
money	1
being	0
spent	1
and	0
the	0
goods	1
flow	0
in	1
and	1
we	0
don't	0
sell	1
you	1
know	0
we	0
don't	1
uh	0
sell	0
products	1
abroad	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
we	0
bring	0
in	1
so	1

were	0
you	0
watching	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
news	1
stations	0
i	0
couldn't	1
even	0
tell	1
you	0
which	1
one	0
i	0
watched	1
but	0
they	0
had	1
on	0
there	1
where	1
the	1
the	0
output	1
from	0
the	0
united	0
states	1
was	0
basically	1
from	0
smaller	1
businesses	0
rather	1
than	0
the	0
larger	1
ones	0
are	0
exporting	1

hum-um	1

all	1
right	1

have	1
you	1
ever	1
been	1
drug	1
tested	1

um	1
that's	1
a	0
good	0
question	1
um	0
uh	0
i	0
had	1
a	1
job	1
i	0
had	1
to	1
go	1
get	0
a	1
blood	1
test	1
for	0

uh-huh	1

um	0
and	1

and	1
they	0
and	1
they	1
did	1
a	0
full	1
blood	1
screen	0
on	1
me	0
but	0
they	1
didn't	0
call	1
that	0
a	0
drug	1
test	0
so	0
tha[t]	1
i	0
think	1
they	0
checked	1
for	0
drugs	0
they	0
just	0
don't	0
tell	1
you	0
they	1
did	0

yeah	1

i	0
had	1
i've	1
had	1
uh	0
two	1
or	1
three	1
drug	1
tests	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
to	0
get	1
before	1
i	1
could	0
start	1
working	1
at	0
a	1
job	1
uh	0
different	1
jobs	1
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
had	0
one	1
at	0
ti	1
and	1
then	1
one	1
at	1
another	0
engineering	1
company	0
and	1
really	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
don't	0
mind	1
them	1
i	1
don't	0
do	0
drugs	1
anyway	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
i	0
did	1
maybe	0
i	0
would	1
[laughter-but]	0
um	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
i	1
know	0
a	0
girl	1
that	1
she's	1
a	0
nurse	1
and	0
they	1
get	0
drug	0
tested	0
randomly	1
i've	1
never	0
been	0
randomly	1
drug	1
tested	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
that	1
would	1
probably	1
bother	1
me	0
to	0
wake	1
up	0
one	0
day	1
and	1
find	1
out	0
halfway	0
through	1
the	1
day	0
that	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
be	1
drug	1
tested	1
and	1
you	1
didn't	0
know	1
about	1
it	1

yeah	0
well	1
i	0
guess	1
it	1
depends	1
on	0
if	1
you	0
got	1
something	1
to	0
worry	1
about	0

yeah	1
i	1
guess	1
so	0
i	0
guess	1
so	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
that	0
it's	0
right	1

well	1
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
i	0
come	1
from	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
biased	1
opinion	1
because	0
i'm	1
a	1
a	1
therapist	1
and	1
a	0
drug	1
and	0
alcohol	1
counselor	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
i've	1
done	1
employee	1
assistant	1
work	1
and	0
i	0
i	1
know	1
the	0
the	1
kind	1
of	1
cost	1
businesses	1
go	0
through	0
in	0
terms	1
of	0
accidents	1
on	1
the	0
job	1
that	0
are	0
specifically	1
drug	0
and	0
alcohol	0
related	1

right	0

right	0

and	0
it's	0
like	1
in	0
the	0
billions	1
of	0
dollars	1
every	0
year	1
um	0
and	1
th[e]	0
the	0
only	0
way	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
prevent	1
that	1
is	0
is	0
you	1
know	0
making	1
sure	1
that	0
the	0
employees	1
are	0
drug	1
and	1
alcohol	0
free	1

that's	0
true	1

and	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
the	1
problem	1
in	1
the	0
work	1
place	1
is	0
that	1
that	1
people	1
are	1
like	1
if	0
your	0
boss	1
is	0
your	0
drinking	1
buddy	0
or	0
whatever	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
can	0
come	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
work	1
drunk	1
and	0
get	1
in	0
an	1
accident	1
and	0
he'll	1
cover	0
up	1
for	0
you	0
and	0
nobody	0
knows	1
about	0
it	0
but	0

right	0

but	0
c[ould]	0
you	0
know	1
ends	1
up	0
costing	1
the	0
company	1
lots	1
and	0
lots	1
of	0
money	0

that's	1
true	1

so	0

i	1
believe	0
it's	0
right	1
especially	1
for	0
certain	1
jobs	1

you	1
know	0
there	1

i	0
think	0
anyone	1
in	0
a	0
in	0
a	0
public	1
job	0
like	0
bus	1
drivers	0
and	0
cab	1
drivers	1
and	0
police	1
officers	0
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
i	1

uh-huh	0

i	1
think	0
they	1
should	0
be	0
randomly	1
drug	1
tested	0
i	1

yeah	0

i	1
believe	0
full	1
force	1
in	0
that	1

yeah	1

i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
i	1
believe	0
every	0
secretary	1
in	0
every	0
company	1
needs	0
to	1
be	1

true	1

you	1
know	0
secretaries	1
aren't	0
aren't	1
really	0
going	0
to	0
cost	0
the	0
company	0
that	1
much	0
money	1
if	0
they	0
fall	1
face	0
forward	0
in	0
their	0
typewriter	1
or	0
something	1
[laughter-so]	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i'm	1
kind	0
of	0
biased	1
too	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
do	1
drugs	0
and	0
so	1
i	1
really	0
don't	1
care	1
one	0
way	0
or	1
another	1
if	1
anybody	1
wants	0
to	0
pull	0
me	0
up	1
tomorrow	1
and	0
test	1
me	0
because	0
i	0
have	1
nothing	0
to	0
worry	1
about	0

uh-huh	1

yeah	0

so	0
i	1
guess	0
that's	1
kind	0
of	0
biased	1

yeah	0
well	1
and	0
it's	0
i	0
i	0
think	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
problems	1
with	0
it	0
is	0
it	0
affects	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
other	1
folks	0
on	0
the	0
job	1
if	0
somebody	0
else	1
is	0
impaired	1

yeah	1
it	1
does	1

because	1
generally	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
um	0
you	0
find	0
out	1
one	1
way	0
or	0
another	1
if	0
somebody's	1
got	0
a	0
problem	1
on	0
the	0
job	1

yeah	1
that's	1
true	0

and	1
if	0
e[ven]	0
even	1
if	0
like	1
you	0
say	1
even	1
if	0
it's	0
just	1
the	0
secretary	1
if	0
her	0
work	1
or	0
abilities	1
start	0
affecting	1
her	0
coworkers	1
then	1
it	0
it's	0
still	1
a	0
problem	1

yeah	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

but	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
do	0
about	0
the	0
occasional	1
user	0
that	0
may	1
have	0
gone	1
to	0
a	0
party	1
three	1
days	0
before	1

and	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
it's	0
been	1
the	0
whole	0
weekend	1
since	0
they've	0
done	1
anything	0
and	0
they	0
happen	1
to	0
be	0
tested	1
monday	0
morning	1
and	0
they	1
could	0
be	1
fired	1
for	0
that	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
unfair	0
also	1

well	0
yeah	0
i	0
guess	1
it	1
comes	1
with	0
the	0
turf	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
so	1
i	0
guess	0
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
suffer	1
the	0
[laughter-consequences]	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
you're	0
i[n]	0
i[n]	0
in	0
terms	1
of	0
drugs	1
they're	0
illegal	1
so	0
you're	0
you're	0
breaking	1
the	0
law	0
anyway	1

that's	1
true	0

that's	0
true	1

probably	1
the	0
the	0
biggest	1
problem	0
with	0
those	1
is	0
they	0
don't	1
do	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
job	1
of	0
of	0
assessing	1
for	0
alcohol	1

that's	0
true	1

and	0
that's	1
probably	0
the	0
biggest	1
problem	0
there	0
is	1

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
so	1
more	1
than	0
drugs	1
and	0
i	1
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
companies	0
that	0
will	1
put	1
you	0
in	0
an	0
alcohol	1
rehabilitation	0
before	1
they	0
would	0
put	0
you	0
in	0
a	0
drug	1
rehab	0

yeah	0

they	0
would	0
pay	1
for	0
an	0
alcohol	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
they	1
don't	0
always	0
pay	1
for	0
drug	1
rehabilitation	0

well	0
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
positive	1
things	0
that	1
ha[s]	0
has	1
come	0
out	1
of	1
it	0
some	1
of	0
the	1
employee	0
assistance	1
program	0
if	0
you	0
do	1
test	0
positive	1
for	0
something	0
they	0
will	1
give	0
you	0
an	0
opp[ortunity]	0
o[pportunity]	0
opportunity	1
to	1
go	1
get	0
your	0
life	1
straight	0
rather	1
than	0
to	0
lose	1
your	0
job	1

yeah	0

that's	1
true	0

and	0
i	1
th[ink]	0

i	1
think	0
that's	0
fair	1

th[ink]	0

yeah	1
and	0
i	1
think	1
the	0
benef[its]	1
the	1
company	1
benefits	0
in	0
the	1
long	1
run	0

yeah	1
that's	1
true	0
that's	1
about	0
all	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
say	0
on	1
it	0

what	1
what	1
kind	0
of	0
testing	1
do	0
they	0
do	1
when	0
you	1
went	1

uh	0
it's	0
a	0
urine	1
test	0

urine	0
screen	1
yeah	1

and	1
they	0
uh	0

yeah	1

it	0
was	0
really	1
very	1
official	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
in	1
a	0
room	1
solely	1
by	0
yourself	0
sign	0
papers	1
that	0
say	1
you	0
were	0
totally	1
alone	1
sign	1
papers	0
that	0
say	1
this	0
is	0
yours	1
and	0

and	0
and	0
you	1
have	0
to	0
fill	1
the	0
bottle	1
yourself	1
and	0
label	1
it	0
yourself	1
and	0
all	1
of	0
that	1
so	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
that	0
they're	0
sure	1
that	0
you	0
haven't	1
borrowed	1
anybody's	0
i	0
guess	1
or	0
something	1

well	0
that	1
happens	1

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
i	0

i	0
ca[n't]	1
it's	0
hard	1
to	0
believe	1
but	0

[laughter-it]	0
happens	0
a	0
lot	1

but	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
does	1

there	0
there	0
are	0
people	1
that	0
kn[ow]	0
pay	1
other	0
people	0
for	0
that	0
to	0
help	1
them	0
out	0

i	0
know	1
i'm	0
amazed	1
at	0
the	0
things	0
people	1
will	0
do	1

yeah	1

it	0
is	1
amazing	1
i	0
guess	1
there	0
are	1
people	0
that	0
do	1
that	0
and	0
they	1
are	0
those	1
are	0
expensive	0
tests	1
i'm	0
glad	1
i	0
never	0
had	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
one	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
it	0
depends	1
r[eally]	0
r[eally]	0
really	1
on	0
how	1
how	0
strong	1
a	0
test	0
it	0
is	1
they've	0
got	0
different	0
degrees	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
as	0
how	1
far	0
back	1
they	0
can	0
check	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	0
so	1

they	0
got	1
some	0
unusual	1
things	0
besides	1
blood	0
and	0
urine	1
tests	0
they've	0
they've	1
got	0
some	1
companies	0
that	0
are	0
doing	1
um	0
hair	1
tests	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1
well	0
that	1
they'll	0
pull	1
out	0
one	0
of	0
your	0
hairs	1
and	0
they	0
can	0
apparently	1
test	1
um	0
back	1
a	0
certain	0
period	0
of	0
time	1
um	0
because	1
um	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
residue	1
ends	0
up	0
in	0
your	0
hair	1
follicles	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0

how	1
weird	1
i	0
didn't	1
know	0
that	1

it's	0
kind	1
of	0

oh	0
that's	0
weird	1

hair	1
follicles	0
i	0
guess	1
are	0
just	0
dead	0
protein	1
and	0
they	0

yeah	1

and	0
it	0
it's	0
apparently	1
al[most]	0
almost	0
like	1
a	0
a	0
calendar	1
they	0
they've	0
got	1
it	0
pretty	1
precise	1
now	1
that	0
they	0
can	0
go	0
back	1
and	0
look	1
at	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
growth	1
in	0
a	0
hair	1
when	1
you	0
used	1
and	1
and	0
that	1
type	0
of	0
thing	0

that's	1
wild	1

so	0

it's	1
amazing	1
the	0
things	1
they	0
can	0
find	0
out	1
from	0
different	0
things	1
on	0
your	0
body	1

yeah	0
so	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
they	0
perfect	1
that	1
and	0
then	0
it's	0
not	1
quite	1
as	0
cumbersome	1
as	0
having	0
to	0
go	0
fill	1
a	0
bottle	1
or	0
give	0
blood	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
[laughter-that's]	1
[laughter-true]	1

that's	1
true	0
i'm	1
glad	1
i	0
never	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
by	0
giving	0
blood	1
i	0
can't	1
stand	1
the	0
thought	0
of	0
giving	0
blood	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
can't	1
even	0
do	1
it	0
for	0
wadley	1
even	0
though	0
it's	0
a	0
good	0
cause	1

yeah	0

well	0
i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	1
to	0
you	0

i	1
did	0
too	1

thank	1
you	0

uh-huh	0
bye	1

bye	1
bye	0

so	0
tha[t]	0
the	1
topic	1
is	1
hobbies	1

your	1
spare	0
time	1

yeah	1
who	1
has	1
spare	1
[laughter-time]	1

um	1

really	0

i	1
really	1
my	1
spare	1
time	1

usually	1

about	0
it	1

full	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
two	0
kids	1

my	0
spare	1
time	1
usually	1
involves	1
something	1
with	1
the	1
kids	1
y[eah]	1

yeah	0

you	1
know	1
hobbies	1

i	1
i	1

and	0
things	1
like	0

and	0

christmas	1
season	1
making	1
them_1	1
up	1
for	0
other	0
people	1
and	1

wise	1
and	0

to	0
do	1
just	0
don't	0
look	0
[laughter-very]	0
good	0

an[d]	0

i've	0
i	1
guess	0
mostly	1

that	0
i	0
did	0

very	0
good	0
topic	1
it	0
feels	0
like	1
if	0
you	0
know	1
not	1

not	1
when	0
you're	0
n[either]	1
neither	0
one	1
of	0

really	0
like	1

were	0
done	1
especially	1
like	0
needlepoint	1

uh-huh	1

needlepoint	0
cushions	1
and	0
things	1

yeah	0

but	1
it	0
just	0
seems	1
like	0
there'd	0
be	0
so	1
much	0
time	1
involved	0
in	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
and	0
that	0
the	0
petty	1
point	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
it's	0

yeah	0

it's	0
like	0
god	1
it	1
j[ust]	0
just	0
seems	1
like	0
it's	0
easier	1
just	0
to	0
go	1
out	0
and	0
buy	1
it	0
[laughter-already]	0
[laughter-made]	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	1
wh[at]	0
what	1
is	0
it's	1
like	0
there	1
but	0
here	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
country	1
stuff	0
is	0
in	1
you	0
know	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
woodwork	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
uh	0
stenciling	1

yeah	0

and	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
to	0
any	0
like	0
a	0
flea	0
market	0
and	0
stuff	0
and	0
there's	1
just	0
tons	1
of	0
stuff	0
everywhere	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
people	0
just	0
do	0
it	0
in	0
their	0
garage	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
then	0
on	0
weekends	0
they	0
go	0
out	1
and	0
sell	0
it	1
and	0
during	0
the	0
week	1
they	0
go	0
back	0
and	0
do	1
some	0
more	1

and	1
see	0
they	1
do	1
that	1
as	0
their	0
job	1
whereas	1
you	0
know	1
for	0
us	1
i[t]	0
and	0

right	1

and	0
they	1
make	1
it	1
cheaper	1
for	0
us	0
to	0
[laughter-buy]	1

yeah	1
definitely	0

so	0
but	1
and	0
i	0
i	1
mean	0
i'm	1
sure	0
it	0
must	1
be	0
relaxing	1
to	0
do	0
things	1
like	0
that	0
because	1
i	1
can	0
remember	1
when	0
i	0
used	0
to	0
do	1
you	0
know	0
those	0
little	1
salt	1
dough	1
figurines	1
and	1
things	1
it	0
was	0
it	1
was	1
relaxing	1
you	0
know	1
creative	1
you	1
felt	1
very	1
creative	1

um-hum	0

but	1
it	1
just	0
was	0
so	0
time	1
time	1
involved	1
you	0
know	1
so	0
much	1
time	1
involved	1
and	1
the	0
different	1
steps	1
and	0
things	0

yeah	0

um-hum	0

so	1
and	0

okay_1	1
well	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	0

i	0
think	0
we	0

done	0
five	1
minutes	0
so	0
we	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
keep	0
talking	1

[laughter-nothing]	1
[laughter-anymore]	0

yeah	0
[laughter-so]	0

okay	1

bye-bye	0

[laughter-okay]	0
bye-bye	0

so	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
most	0
of	1
your	1
current	1
event	0
information	1

well	1
duri[ng]	1
see	1
i'm	1
going	1
to	1
school	1
right	1
now	1
and	1
uh	1
while	1
i'm	1
working	1
i	1
don't	1
get	1
a	1
i	1
don't	1
get	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
read	1
the	0
paper	1
a	1
lot	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	0
don't	1
watch	0
tv	1
as	0
much	1
really	0
either	1
because	0
uh	1
my	1
free	1
time	1
is	1
kind	1
of	1
and	0
i	1
do	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
other	1
stuff	1
with	1
it	1

right	1

while	1
i'm	0
at	0
work	1
sometimes	0
i	0
on	1
the	0
computer	1
network	0
um	0
i	0
read	1
the	1
news	1
sometimes	1
and	1

um-hum	0

and	1
that's	1
kind	0
of	1
helpful	1

i	0
would	1
imagine	1
going	1
to	0
college	1
though	0
your	0
professors	1
and	0
different	1
things	1
you	0
keep	0
up	1
on	1
what's	0
going	1
on	1

that's	0
true	1
i	0
mean	0
my	1
roommates	0
and	1
stuff	1
you	1
know	1
people	0
around	1
me	0
talk	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	1

and	0
the	0
people	1
i	0
work	0
with	0
are	0
pretty	0
you	1
know	0
up	0
up-to-date	1
on	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
stuff	0
so	0

right	1
well	1
i'm	1
a	0
housewife	1
i	0
have	0
three	1
kids	1
and	1
so	1
um	0
i	1
get	1
most	1
of	1
my	1
information	1
probably	1
through	0
just	1
the	1
news	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock	0
and	0
then	1
um	1
talking	1
with	0
people	0
and	1
just	1
hearing	1
what's	0
going	1
on	1
but	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

do	0
you	0
watch	1
do	0
you	0
watch	0
the	0
network	1
like	0
major	1
network	0
news	1
or	0
do	0
you	0
watch	0
like	0
the	0
mcneil	1
lehrer	1
hour	0

just	1
the	1
regular	0
channel	1
just	1
channel	0
eight	1

oh	1
really	1

that's	1
our	0
channel	1
here	1
that's	0
the	1
um	1
eyewitness	1
news	1

uh-huh	1

so	1

oh	1
ch[annel]	1
see	1
channel	1
where	1
i	1
am	1
channel	0
eight's	1
um	1
like	0
public	1
tv	1
so	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	1
different	1

oh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1

i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
the	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
the	1
commentators	1
on	0
like	1
the	1
major	1
networks	1
like	1
right	1
it's	1
kind	1
of	0
appropriate	1
right	0
now	1
because	1
of	1
the	0
election	1
stuff	1
going	1
on	1
but	1
um	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
um	0
they	1
kind	1
of	0
get	0
to	1
throw	1
their	0
opinions	1
into	1
how	1
they	1
you	0
know	1
report	1
on	0
the	1
news	1

right	1
and	1
i	0
think	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
elections	1
they	1
choose	1
who	1
they're	0
going	0
to	0
follow	1
and	0
who	0
they're	0
not	1
and	0
basically	1
you	0
know	1
if	0
a	0
c[andidate]	0
candidate	1
can	0
get	1
them	0
to	0
follow	1
then	1
the	0
news	1
will	0
you	1
know	0
kind	0
of	0
publicize	1
his	0
name	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
exactly	1

i	1
don't	1
think	1
that	0
the	0
way	0
i	1
get	0
the	0
news	1
is	0
the	0
right	1
way	0
to	0
get	1
it	0
i	0
think	1
you	0
get	0
a	0
very	1
lopsided	0
picture	1
of	0
what's	0
going	0
on	1

uh-huh	0
uh	0
because	0
they	1
can	0
they	0
can	0
only	1
report	1
on	0
i	0
mean	1
they	0
give	1
each	0
candidate	1
perhaps	1
you	0
know	1
ten	1
second	0
blurbs	1
in	1
which	1
to	0
you	1
know	1
to	0
say	1
you	0
you	0
just	1
can't	1
get	1
a	0
full	0
picture	1
of	1
you	1
know	0
their	0
message	1
unless	1
you	0
have	0
time	1
to	0
sit	0
down	0
and	0
r[ead]	0
and	0
probably	0
read	1
something	0
on	0
it	1

right	1

right	1
and	0
the	0
news	1
too	0
it	0
just	1
doesn't	0
um	0
cover	1
a[ll]	0
that	1
many	0
stories	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
just	1
covers	0
your	0
basic	1
you	1
know	0
violent	1
crimes	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
and	0
and	0
your	0
ca[tastrophes]	0
catastrophes	1
with	0
weather	1
and	0
stuff	0
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
other	1
than	0
that	1
you	0
really	1
don't	0
know	0
what's	0
going	0
on	1

yeah	1

um	0
i	1
will	0
read	0
our	0
current	1
letters	1
that	0
come	1
out	0
on	0
elections	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
do	0
read	0
that	1
and	0
i	0
do	1
study	0
who's	1
running	1
in	0
our	0
area	0
and	0
i	0
do	1
study	0
what's	1
going	0
on	0
in	0
the	0
economy	1
it	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
do	1
read	1
other	0
magazines	1
um	0
too	1
to	0
get	1
my	0
information	1

what	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	0
see	0
i	1
subscribe	0
to	0
like	0
science	1
news	1
and	0
that's	1
that's	1
real	0
good	0
because	0
it	0
gives	1
like	0
a	0
brief	1
summary	1
of	0
all	1
like	0
the	0
updates	1
like	0
of	0
what's	1
going	0
on	0
in	0
science	1
without	1
getting	0
into	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
detail	1
that	0
would	0
you	1
know	0
bog	1
me	0
down	1
that	0
i	0
wouldn't	0
know	1
about	0

right	1

but	0
other	1
than	0
that	1
i	0
don't	0
really	0
r[ead]	0
i	1
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
really	0
subscribe	1
to	0
anything	0
else	1

i	0
i	0
used	1
to	0
read	0
every	1
month	0
a	0
reader's	1
digest	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
um	0
now	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	0
have	0
friends	1
that	0
clip	0
articles	1
or	0
if	0
i	1
you	1
know	0
am	0
interested	1
in	0
something	0
of	0
course	1
during	0
the	0
w[ar]	0
when	0
we	1
were	0
in	0
war	1
i	0
read	1
up	0
on	0
that	1
just	0
a	0
little	0
in	0
the	0
newspaper	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
what	0
was	0
going	0
on	0
but	0

oh	0
yeah	1

but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
times	0
i	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
wish	1
i	0
had	1
the	0
time	0
to	0
read	1
all	0
the	0
stories	0
in	0
the	0
newspaper	1
but	0
i	0
just	1
can't	0
seem	0
to	0
find	0
the	0
time	1

yeah	1

if	0
they'd	0
put	1
it	0
out	0
in	0
a	0
video	1
or	0
on	0
not	0
a	0
video	1
but	0
a	0
cassette	1
tape	1
or	0
something	1
where	0
you	1
could	0
just	1
listen	1
to	1
it	0
i	1
would	0
do	1
that	0
while	1
i	0
was	1
doing	0
other	0
things	1

yeah	1

but	0

well	1
i	1
remember	0
dur[ing]	1
back	1
during	0
the	1
uh	1
during	0
the	0
war	1
everyone	0
here	1
at	0
work	1
always	0
had	0
the	1
radio	1
or	1
the	0
tv	1
on	0
because_1	0
that	1
they	1
were	0
going	0
constantly	1
with	0
that	1
stuff	0

right	1

but	0
uh	1

well	1
i	0
um	0
they	1
even	0
did	0
a	0
story	1
on	0
our	0
news	0
here	1
in	0
texas	1
on	0
what	1
people	0
wanted	0
to	0
see	0
more	1
of	0
and	0
people	1
said	0
that	0
they	0
wanted	0
to	0
see	0
more	1
on	1
outside	1
of	0
texas	1
news	1
you	0
know	1
we	1
just	1
don't	0
want	1
to	0
hear	1
every	1
night	1
all	0
the	0
killings	1
that	0
went	0
on	1
here	0
in	0
dallas	1

yeah	1

that	1
we	1
want	0
to	0
hear	0
what's	1
going	0
on	1
with	0
the	0
economy	1
what's	1
being	0
done	0
to	0
help	1
it	0
what's	1
going	0
on	1
in	0
other	0
countries	1
what's	0
you	0
know	1
just	0
more	1
information	1

if	0
they	0
reported	1
every	0
m[urder]	0
if	0
they	0
reported	1
every	0
violent	1
crime	0
in	0
atlanta	1
it	0
would	0
take	0
it	0
would	0
probably	1
take	0
the	0
whole	0
news	1
[laughter-hour]	0

[laughter-yeah]	0
well	0

but	0
uh	1

well	0
i	0
guess	1
you'll	0
get	0
pretty	0
good	0
news	1
coverage	0
in	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	1
when	0
you	0
host	1
the	0
uh	0
summer	0
olympics	1

oh	0
yeah	1
that's	1
they	0
still	1
already	1
they're	0
having	0
like	0
um	0
in	1
the	0
newspaper	1
they	0
have	0
a	0
section	1
i	0
think	1
every	0
now	1
and	0
then	0
o[n]	0
on	0
the	0
olympics	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
they've	1
got	0
like	0
a	0
countdown	1
it's	0
like	0
sixteen	1
hundred	0
days	1
or	0
something	1

i	1
know	0
we're	1
trying	0
to	0
get	0
tickets	1
to	0
it	0
right	0
now	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

that's	1
gonna	0
be	0
crazy	1
that	0
time	1
of	0
year	1
here	0
but	0

but	0
uh	0

yeah	1

i	0
can't	1
believe	1
i	0
mean	0
they're	0
they're	1
uh	0
stretching	1
out	1
the	0
olympic	1
news	0
for	0
that	0
much	0
coverage	1
over	0
i	0
guess	1
people	0
want	0
to	0
hear	1
about	0
it	0
also	1
big	0
in	0
big	1
in	0
the	1
news	1
right	0
now	0
is	0
the	1
braves	1
because	0
they're	1
uh	1
they're	0
in	0
you	1
know	0
tr[aining]	0
spring	1
training	1
or	0
whatever	0
and	1

right	1
right	1

and	1
they	0
did	1
so	0
well	0
last	1
year	0

yeah	1
they	1
spent	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
time	0
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
they	0
spend	0
a	0
long	1
time	0
on	0
sports	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
um	0
that's	1
fine	1
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	0
more	1
time	0
spent	0
on	0
other	1
things	1

yeah	1

but	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	1
they	0
way	1
they	0
do	0
the	1
newscasts	1
uh	0
i	0
wish	1
they	0
they	0
kind	0
of	0
separated	1
it	0
you	1
know	0
or	0
if	0
you	0
wanted	1
to	0
watch	0
one	1
thing	0
you	0
could	0
turn	1
to	0
s[ome]	0
some	0
channel	1
for	0
it	0
but	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
cable	1

it's	1
it's	1
hard	1
to[pic]	1
topic	1
because	1
is	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
doing	1
a	1
good	0
job	1
or	1
a	1
bad	1
job	1
and	0
you	1
got	1
to	0
divide	1
it	0
two	1
different	0
categories	1
whether	1
you	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
or	1
whether	0
you	0
live	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
rural	1
place	1
like	1
i	1
do	1

yeah	1
and	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about	1
public	1
schools	1
being	1
lower	1
level	1
high	1
school	1
level	1
or	1
state	1
school	0

well	0
public	1
school	0
all	0
the	0
way	0
up	0
kindergarten	1
all	0
the	1
way	0
up	0
to	0
uh	0
uh	0
high	0
school	0

okay	1
but	1
you're	1
excluding	1
high-level	1
education	1

yes	0
well	1
yeah	1
i	1
am	1
um	0

okay	1

act[ually]	0
actually	0
i	1
think	1
that	0
i	0
at	1
the	0
higher	1
level	0
education	1
i	1
don't	1
think	0
there's	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
a	1
problem	1
there	1
it's	0
pretty	1
much	1
funded	1
well	0
there	0
are	1
small	0
colleges	1
that	1
i'm	0
sure	0
are	0
struggling	1
but	1
uh	0
it's	0
the	0
job	1
that	0
the	0
the	0
high	1
school	0
and	0
the	0
grade	1
schools	0
are	1
doing	0
that	1
i	0
see	1
in	0
a	0
area	1
like	0
ours	0
our	0
school	0
even	0
a	0
bad	1
school	0
is	0
a	0
good	1
school	0
up	0
here	1
where	1
if	0
i	0
lived	1
in	0
new	0
york	0
city	1
or	0
washington	1
dc	1
uh	0
i	1
would	0
seriously	0
consider	0
moving	1
if	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
child	1
i	0
wouldn't	0
let	0
them	0
go	1
to	0
a	0
public	1
school	0
system	0
there	0
but	0
of	0
course	0
people	0
are	0
trapped	1
economically	1
and	0
they	0
can't	0
do	1
that	0

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
down	1
here	0
the	1
school's	1
are	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
they	0
rate	0
i	1
moved	0
to	1
arkansas	1
and	1
texas	1
after	1
living	1
in	0
ohio	1
and	0
the	1
schools	0
down	1
here	0
rate	1
you	0
know	0
bottom	0
ten	1
percent	1
across	0
the	0
country	0
and	0
having	0
been	1
through	1
grade	1
school	1
up	1
there	1
and	0
coming	0
down	1
here	0
to	1
high	1
school	1
i	0
can	1
understand	0
why	1
because	0
they're	0
so	1
far	0
behind	1
and	0
so	1
poorly	0
staffed	1
half	1
the	0
time	0
the	0
teachers	1
don't	1
know	0
what's	1
going	0
on	1

well	0
that's	1
really	0
too	0
bad	1
because	1
i[t]	0
it	0
it's	0
giving	0
some	0
people	1
unfair	0
advantage	1
i	0
mean	0
we	1
our	0
high	1
school	0
up	0
here	1
is	0
like	0
a	0
junior	0
college	1
in	0
florida	1

right	0

what	0
we	0
learned	0

well	1
that	1
was	1
my	1
experience	1
going	1
through	1
junior	1
high	0
up	0
there	1
when	0
i	1
came	1
down	1
south	1
for	1
high	1
school	1
i	1
was	1
just	0
repeating	1
what	1
i'd	1
already	1
done	1
because	1
we	0
were	0
so	1
far	0
advanced	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
i'd	1
been	0
in	1
a	0
parochial	1
school	0
before	1
junior	1
high	0
and	1
you	1
know	1
even	0
the	1
public	1
schools	0
are	1
behind	1
the	0
parochial	1
schools	1

yeah	0

so	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
i	0
like	1
the	0
concept	1
they've	0
got	1
now	1
where	0
they	1
have	0
more	1
directed	1
education	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
pick	1
a	0
career	1
path	1
or	0
you	0
get	0
counseling	1
earlier	1
and	0
then	1
you	0
you	0
learn	1
the	0
things	1
that	0
help	1
you	0
rather	0
than	0
spending	1
four	1
years	1
learning	0
the	0
same	1
things	0
over	0
and	0
over	1

oh	0
they	0
they	0
have	1
that	0
down	0
there	1
that	0

well	1
they	0
talk	1
about	0
it	0
and	1
there	0
are	1
a	0
few	1
in	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
more	1
like	0
in	0
i	0
live	1
in	1
a	0
big	1
metroplex	1
and	0
some	1
of	1
the	0
the	0
better	1
parts	0
of	0
the	1
metroplex	1
the	0
the	0
suburbs	1
that	1
are	0
richer	1
have	1
those	0
kind	0
of	0
target	1
schools	0
but	0
uh	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
it's	0
like	1
if	0
if	0
your	0
father	1
owns	0
a	0
grocery	1
store	0
and	1
you're	1
really	0
interested	1
in	1
that	1
there's	1
no	1
reason	1
that	1
you	0
should	1
take	1
college	1
prep	0
courses	1
when	0
you	1
can	0
get	1
some	0
general	1
business	1
courses	0
in	1
high	1
school	0

right	0

or	1
if	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
go	1
the	0
science	1
route	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
target	1
school	0
that	0
specializes	1
in	0
science	1
or	0
art	1
you	0
know	0
there's	0
no	1
point	1
in	0
you	0
know	1
i'm	1
an	0
engineering	1
student	0
and	0
if	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
go	0
take	0
art	1
classes	0
you	0
know	0
i'm	1
not	0
going	0
to	1
use	1
them_1	0
and	0
through	0
high	1
school	0
i	1
could	0
have	0
gone	0
so	0
much	0
further	1
if	0
i'd	0
gone	1
to	0
a	0
school	1
that	0
was	0
directed	1

yeah	0
that's	0
where	0
i	0
was	0
fortunate	0
i'm	1
a	0
i'm	0
a	0
technician	1
and	0
we	0
had	0
a	0
vocational	1
um	0
electronics	1
in	0
our	1
high	0
school	0

right	0
in	1
high	1
school	1

so	0
when	0
i	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
first	0
year	0
of	0
tech	1
school	1
uh	0
i	1
had	0
a	0
very	0
easy	0
time	1
because	0
our	0
high	1
school	0
had	1
a	0
a	0
good	1
program	0

right	0

i	0
think	1
the	0
schools	0
today	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
public	1
schools	0
are	0
just	0
they're	0
just	0
overrun	1
you	0
know	0
they	0
don't	0
know	0
what	1
to	0
do	1
there's	0
too	1
many	0
kids	1
and	0
not	1
enough	0
teachers	1
and	0
too	0
many	0
kids	0
don't	0
care	0

yeah	0
i	0
find	1
that	0
that	1
the	0
that	1
in	0
the	0
in	1
the	0
cities	1
it's	0
more	0
less	0
the	0
kids	0
go	0
there	1
to	0
socialize	1
not	0
really	0
to	0
learn	1
and	0

and	0

right	0

and	0
the	0
parents	1
send	0
them_1	0
there	1
because	0
they're	0
supposed	1
to	0
and	0
plus	0
it	0
gets	0
them	0
out	0
of	0
their	1
hair	1
and	0
i	0
also	1
find	1
that	0
that	0
you	0
can	1
send	1
a	0
kid	0
to	0
school	1
but	0
if	0
don't	0
work	0
with	0
them	0
as	0
a	0
parent	1
i	0
think	1
you're	0
putting	0
your	0
child	0
at	0
a	0
big	0
disadvantage	1

yeah	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
there's	0
some	1
kids	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
want	1
to	0
go	0
learn	1
but	0
most	0
of	0
them_1	0
just	0
want	0
to	1
go	0
play	1

yeah	0
well	0
i	0
could	1
i	1
could	0
see	1
if	0
a	0
kid	0
doesn't	0
have	0
any	0
encouragement	1
if	1
they're	1
you	0
know	0
come	0
from	0
a	0
broken	1
home	1
and	0
their	0
parents	1
are	0
more	0
concerned	0
about	1
trying	1
to	0
work	1
and	0
or	0
maybe	0
they're	0
unemployed	0
and	0
they're	0
mad	0
at	0
the	0
world	0
i	0
can	0
see	0
where	0
that	0
wouldn't	0
be	0
very	1
good	0
for	0
a	0
a	0
kid	1
you	0
know	1
he's	0
coming	0
up	1
will	0
you	0
help	1
me	0
with	0
my	0
homework	1
and	0
they're	1
no	1
get	0
away	1
from	0
me	0
i've	0
had	0
a	0
terrible	0
day	1
so	0
it's	0
got	1
a	0
lot	0
to	0
do	0
with	1
economics	1
in	0
the	1
area	1
that	1
you	0
come	1
from	0

yeah	0
that's	0
true	0
i'm	0
wondering	0
with	0
the	0
boom	0
down	0
here	0
it's	1
well	0
not	1
at	0
the	1
moment	1
but	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
the	0
industry's	0
moving	1
southward	1

yes	0
are	0
they	0
going	0
to	0
move	1
to	0
uh	0
mexico	1

so	0

oh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	1
about	0
that	1
but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
industry	1
up	1
in	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
northern	1
states	0
is	0
moving	0
south	1

and	0
i'm	0
wondering	1
if	0
that's	1
going	0
to	0
have	0
any	0
effect	1
you	0
know	0
on	0
what	0
you	1
see	0
now	1
we're	0
we're	0
we're	0
behind	1
down	0
here	1

yeah	0

i	0
say	0
we	1
because_1	0
i	0
live	1
here	0
if	0
that	0
might	0
not	1
turn	0
around	1
in	0
the	0
next	1
you	0
know	0
fifteen	1
twenty	0
years	1

yeah	0
maybe	1
the	0
maybe	0
they'll	0
bring	0
their	0
good	1
schools	1
with	0
them	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
the	0
industry	1
comes	1
hopefully	0
they'll	0
promote	1
good	0
schools	1

yeah	0

because	0
i	0
know	0
the	0
town	1
that	0
i	0
come	1
from	0
the	0
the	1
uh	0
the	0
large	1
ibm	1
plant	0
has	0
something	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
the	0
top	1
rated	0
high	0
school	0
because	0
of	0
their	0
tax	1
base	0
for	0
one	1
and	0
plus	1
for	0
for	1
the	0
type	1
of	0
student	1
that's	0
going	1
to	0
that	0
school	1
it's	0
going	0
to	0
raise	1
the	0
level	0
of	0
the	0
school	1
because	0
your	0
parents	1
are	0
engineers	1
or	0
chemists	1

right	0

they're	0
they're	0
you're	0
most	0
likely	1
to	0
do	0
better	1
in	0
school	1
they're	0
going	0
to	0
help	1
you	1

you	0
hope	0

yeah	0
you	0
hope	0
well	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0
just	0
think	1
it	0
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
duty	1
of	0
the	0
parent	1
to	0
do	1
that	0
i	0
mean	1
jeez	1
my	0
parents	1
always	0
helped	0
me	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
like	0
you	0
say	0
it's	0
the	0
way	1
you're	0
raised	1
and	0
the	1
economic	1
situation	1
you're	0
in	0
i	0
can	0
see	1
some	0
lady	1
she's	0
twenty	0
one	0
years	0
old	0
and	0
she's	0
got	0
four	1
kids	1
a	0
kid	0
in	0
her	0
first	0
grader	0
i	0
don't	1
see	0
where	0
she's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
much	0
time	1
for	0
him	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
like	0

i	0
guess	0
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
wonder	0
is	0
it	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
is	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
who	1
whose	1
supposed	0
to	0
make	1
the	0
change	1
the	0
the	0
state	0
the	0
govern[ment]	0
the	0
federal	1
government	1
you	0
know	1
where's	0
the	1
money	1
supposed	1
to	0
come	1
from	0
is	1
it	1
you	0
know	0
what	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
actually	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
should	0
be	1
a	0
civic	1
level	0
the	0
city	1
level	0
and	0
a	0
a	0
system	1
level	0
really	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
and	0
t[o]	0
to	0
see	0
what	0
they	0
need	1
and	0
not	0
overinflate	1
it	0

what	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
advocate	1
more	0
taxes	0
or	0
better	0
management	0
of	0
what	1
they	0
got	1

like	1
if	0
the	0
teachers	1
are	0
getting	0
six	0
percent	0
raises	1
every	0
year	1
when	0
people	0
in	0
industry	1
have	0
been	0
getting	0
cut	0
back	1
and	0
you're	0
getting	0
raises	0
every	0
eighteen	0
months	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
go	1
hey	1
now	0
wait	1
a	0
minute	0
we're	0

yeah	0

we're	0
in	0
a	0
recession	1
here	0
we	1
uh	0
our	0
town	1
didn't	0
pass	0
the	0
school	1
budget	0
this	0
year	1
and	0
for	0
the	0
first	1
time	1
in	0
many	1
many	0
years	1
just	0
because	0
people	1
are	0
are	0
in	0
the	0
recession	1
and	0
they're	0
even	0
though	1
we've	1
uh	0
enjoyed	1
very	0
good	0
employment	1
here	0
for	0
the	0
past	0
ten	1
years	0
now	0
we	0
got	0
eight	1
percent	0
uh	0
unemployment	1
when	0
it	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
four	1
or	0
five	1
people	0
are	0
going	0
whoa	0

yeah	0

so	0

starts	0
hitting	0
closer	1
to	0
home	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	0
always	0
see	1
it's	0
all	0
it's	0
all	0
money	1
this	0
like	0
a	0
couple	0
other	1
topics	1
we	0
had	0
talked	0
about	0
was	0
crime	1
it	0
it's	0
it's	0
all	0
money	1
based	1
and	0
what	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
unless	0
you	0
just	0
get	0
down	0
to	0
the	0
parent	1
level	0
and	0
and	0
then	0
if	0
you're	0
in	0
a	0
bad	1
situation	0
where	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
send	0
your	0
child	0
to	0
a	0
bad	0
school	1
who	0
knows	0
bu[t]	0
maybe	1
we	0
do	0
we	0
need	0
some	0
more	0
catholic	1
schools	1
support	0
the	0
church	0
instead	0
they	0
seem	0
to	0
have	0
done	1
a	0
the	0
good	1
job	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
in	0
uh	0
some	1
places	0
uh	0
you	0
couldn't	1
go	1
to	0
a	0
public	0
school	1
it	0
was	0
miles	1
down	0
the	0
road	1
and	0
the	0
only	0
school	1
you	0
could	1
go	0
to	0
was	0
the	0
baptist	1
school	0
or	0
the	0
catholic	1
school	0
so	0

yeah	0
they're	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
strict	0

yeah	0
the	0
i	0
don't	0

you	1
uh	0
have	0
to	0
learn	0
you	0
aren't	0
given	1
the	0
chance	0
to	0
you	0
know	0
screw	1
off	0
all	0
the	0
time	0

yeah	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	0
would	0
do	1
that	0
to	0
my	0
[laughter-child]	1
[laughter-though]	1
but	0
so	0
hum	0
pretty	0
much	0
though	0
see	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
any	0
good	0
ideas	1
or	0
or	0
anything	1
that	0
would	0
contribute	1
see	0
this	1
isn't	0
a	0
subject	1
that	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	0
about	1
because	1
i'm	0
never	1
faced	1
with	0
it	0
because	0
our	0
school	1
system	0
in	0
vermont	1
it	0
seems	1
to	0
do	0
a	0
really	0
good	0
job	1

well	1
i	1
know	1
i'm	1
in	0
the	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
only	1
reason	0
i	0
asked	0
about	0
secondary	1
schools	0
or	0
you	0
know	0
advanced	1
education	1
is	0
because	0
down	0
here	1
you	0
know	0
going	1
to	0
the	0
university	1
of	0
texas	1
the	0
education	0
i'm	1
getting	0
i	0
think	1
is	0
kind	0
of	0
shoddy	1
for	0
a	0
public	1
school	1

is	0
it	0

i	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i'm	0
getting	1
what	0
i	0
should	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
texas	1
it's	0
next	1
to	0
free	1
because	0
th[ey]	0
they	0
pay	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
it	0
it's	0
state	0
supported	0

well	0
that	0

but	0
at	0
the	0
same	1
time	1
it's	0
really	1
not	1
it's	0
not	1
like	0
going	0
to	0
mit	1
my	1
engineering	0
degree	0
will	0
be	0
nothing	1
like	0
somebody	1
coming	0
out	0
of	0
mit	1
and	0
that's	1
it's	1
really	1
too	0
bad	1

well	0

but	0
that's	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	1
think	1
it	0
just	0
builds	1
on	0
the	0
foundation	1
that	0
they've	0
already	1
built	1
you	1
get	1
people	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
schools	0
and	0
col[lege]	1
junior	1
colleges	0
that	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
background	1
for	0
an	0
mit	0
kind	0
of	0
curriculum	1
so	0

so	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
lesser	1
engineering	0
school	0
we	0
have	1
a	0
very	1
good	0
public	1
school	0
up	0
here	1
and	1
a	0
degree	1
out	0
there	0
means	1
a	0
lot	1
it's	0
a	0
very	1
good	1
school	1
it's	0
it's	0
university	1
of	0
vermont	1
um	0
we	1
also	1
have	0
some	0
two	1
year	0
college	1
well	1
there's	0
a	0
four	1
year	0
colleges	0
they	0
all	1
have	0
a	0
pretty	1
good	0
reputation	1
but	0
like	0
you	0
say	0
you	0

hello	1
ann	1

hello	1
chuck	1

um	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
i	1
attended	1
a	0
conference	1
here	0
at	1
utah	1
state	0
university	1
on	1
recycling	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
interested	1
to	0
hear	1
because_1	1
they	0
had	0
some	1
people	1
from	1
the	0
epa	1
and	1
lots	1
of	0
different	1
places	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
they	1
had	0
basically	1
decided	1
that	0
there	1
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
real	0
problem	1
here	0
within	0
a	0
few	0
years	1
on	0
solid	0
waste	1

um	0
i	0
didn't	1
think	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
revelation	1

well	1
it's	0
not	1
too	0
new	0

right	1
so	1
what	1
what	1
i[s]	1
is	1
the	1
epa	1
recommending	1
now	1

oh	0
they	0
really	1
didn't	0
propose	1
any	0
solutions	1
actually	1
they	0
were	0
the	1
guy	1
was	1
pretty	1
negative	1
about	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
was	1
doing	0
even	1
though	0
he	1
was	0
from	0
the	1
epa	1

um-hum	0

but	0
he	1
had	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	1
facts	1
to	1
to	1
give	1
and	1
things	0
like	0
how	1
many	0
solid	1
waste	0
plants	1
were	0
being	0
shut	1
down	1
and	0
and	1
uh	0
uh	0
one	0
of	1
the	0
most	1
interesting	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
was	1
recycling	1
of	1
of	1
news	1
print	0
and	1
he	0
was	1
talking	1
about	1
um	0
the	1
city	1
of	1
new	0
york	1
and	0
how	1
they	0
went	1
and	0
collected	1
all	1
this	0
news	1
print	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	0
could	1
sell	1
it	0
for	0
a	1
while	1
they	0
were	0
able	1
to	1
sell	1
it	0
for	0
some	1
amount	0
per	1
ton	1
and	0
now	1
at	0
this	1
stage	0
of	0
the	1
game	0
where	1
they	1
have	1
gotten	1
into	0
recycling	1
they've	0
collected	1
so	1
much	1
news	1
print	1
that	1
they	0
have	1
to	1
pay	1
to	1
have	0
it	1
hauled	0
away	1

why	1
that's	1
a	0
that's	0
a	0
common	1
problem	0
now	1
that	0
seems	1
that	1
has	0
happened	1
in	0
dallas	1
as	0
well	1
as	0
new	0
york	1
and	1
i	0
try	1
to	0
recycle	1
all	1
of	0
the	0
newspapers	0
that	0
come	0
to	0
my	1
house	0
and	0
after	1
a	0
while	1
i	0
just	1
quit	0
taking	0
the	0
newspaper	1
because	0
i	0
couldn't	1
recycle	1
it	0
anymore	0
which	1
isn't	1
good	1
for	0
business	0
on	0
the	0
other	1
end	1
either	0
i	0
suppose	1

yeah	0
we're	1
doing	0
some	0
here	1
in	0
in	0
cash	1
valley	1
the	0
community	1
here	1

um-hum	0

there's	1
uh	0
we've	1
actually	1
got	0
a	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
nice	1
set	0
up	0
we've	1
got	1
a	0
couple	0
of	1
plants	1
here	0
that	0
actually	1
take	0
uh	0
recycled	0
paper	1
and	1
shred	1
it	0
and	1
spray	1
it	0
with	0
chemical	0
treatment	1
so	0
that	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
fire	1
hazard	1
and	0
make	0
it	0
into	0
insulation	1

right	1

and	0
they	1
can	0
actually	0
use	1
as	1
much	1
recycled	1
paper	0
as	0
the	0
community	1
can	0
get	1
to	0
them_1	0
because	0
they're	0
actually	0
buying	1
it	0
and	0
shipping	1
it	0
in	0
from	0
outside	1

well	0
that's	1
good	1

so	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
real	0
keys	1
it	0
sounds	1
like	0
to	0
getting	0
recycling	1
for	0
uh	0
paper	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1
to	0
go	1
is	0
to	0
get	1
some	0
sort	0
of	0
business	1
to	0
actually	0
want	1
it	0
once	0
you've	0
collected	1
it	0

right	1
there	0
has	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
a	0
reuse	1
for	0
it	0
i	0
mean	0
that's	0
why	1
they	1
recycle	1
the	0
one	0
i	1
think	0
is	0
the	0
most	0
interesting	1
is	0
with	0
the	0
recycled	1
bottles	1
and	0
all	1
that	0
uh	0
the	0
industry	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
doing	1
with	0
the	0
recycled	1
polymers	1
uh	0
everything	1
from	0
uh	0
waste	1
baskets	1
to	0
carpet	1
to	0
the	1
no	1
stick	0
i	0
mean	0
the	0
sticky	1
slide	1
rugs	0
under	1
the	0
carpet	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
i	1
think	0
they're	0
even	0
putting	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
roadways	1
these	1
days	1
and	0
they're	1
making	0
clothes	1
now	0
that	0
are	0
recycled	1
like	1
the	0
recycled	1
plastic	0
coke	1
bottles	0
and	1
and	0
milk	1
cartons	0
and	0
things	1
like	1
that	1

and	0
there's	1
a	0
paper	0
presented	1
at	0
this	0
conference	1
from	0
a	0
guy	1
from	0
alabama	1
and	0
he	1
was	1
kind	0
of	0
hired	1
to	1
do	1
a	0
study	1
by	0
two	1
departments	1
for	0
the	1
government	1
one	1
was	0
like	0
environmental	1
protection	1
and	0
the	1
other	1
one	0
was	0
oh	0
i	1
can't	1
remember	0
what	0
but	1
the	0
basic	1
idea	1
it	1
was	0
presented	1
to	0
him	1
was	0
how	1
can	0
we	1
maximize	1
the	1
amount	0
of	1
energy	1
that	1
we	0
can	0
get	0
back	1
from	0
recycling	1
and	1
minimize	1
the	0
volume	1
of	1
stuff	1
we	0
are	0
putting	1
into	0
our	1
landfill	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
the	0
solution	1
that	1
he	1
came	0
up	0
with	0
for	0
plastics	1
and	0
it	0
was	1
really	1
quite	1
amazing	1
because_1	1
he	0
says	0
well	1
the	0
best	1
thing	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
plastics	1
is	0
to	0
burn	1
them_1	0

oh	1
really	1

he	0
came	1
to	1
the	0
conclusion	1
plastics	1
is	1
actually	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
biggest	1
problems	1
in	0
landfills	1
cause	1
it's	0
it's	0
low	1
weight	1
but	1
it's	0
high	1
volume	1
so	0
it	0
takes	1
up	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
space	1

right	1

and	1
there's	0
almost	1
no	1
energy	1
there's	0
very	1
little	0
energy	1
value	0
in	0
actually	1
doing	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
recycling	1
but	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
energy	0
in	0
it	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
burn	1
it	0
and	0
use	0
it	0
to	0
produce	1
electricity	1

huh	0

so	1
his	1
solution	0
was	0
to	0
burn	1
plastic	1
collect	1
it	0
and	0
burn	1
it	0

well	1
it's	0
carbon	1
so	0
that	1
makes	0
sense	1
like	0
a	1
carbon	1
fuel	1
of	1
some	1
sort	0
but	0
what	1
what	0
about	0
emissions	1

yeah	1

and	0
it's	0
more	1
than	0
even	0
paper	1
or	0
something	1
like	0
that	0
there's	0
more	1
energy	0
in	0
it	0
per	0
pound	1
or	0
whatever	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
he	0
didn't	1
deal	1
with	0
that	1

oh	1

he	0
just	1
said	0
burn	1
it	0

[laughter-okay]	1

he	0
didn't	0
talk	1
about	0
cleaning	1
it	0
up	1
or	0
anything	0
like	0
that	1
so	0
it's	0
not	1
very	0
practical	1
is	0
it	0

no	1
well	0
that's	1
interesting	1
i	0
bet	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
good	0
day	1
at	0
the	0
uh	0
conference	1
then	1

yeah	1
well	0
real	1
interest[ing]	0

did	0
it	1
change	1
anything	0
for	0
you	1

um	0
not	1
too	0
much	1
i'm	1
uh	0
i	1
got	0
a	1
bit	1
actuall[y]	0

you	1
said	1
you	1
have	1
four	1
cats	1

yes	1

jumped	1
off	0
the	0
balcony	0
actually	0
of	0
a	0
second	1
story	1
apartment	1

he'd	0
never	1
been	0
outside	1
like	1

know	0
by	1
himself	0
outside	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
it	0
started	1
raining	0
and	0
i	1
was	1
hysterical	1
i	0
was	0
i	1
mean	0
you	0
would	0
have	0
thought	1
a	0
child	1
had	0
died	0

yeah	0
um-hum	0

i	1
called	0
everyone	0
i	0
knew	1
i	0
had	0
every	0
friend	1
i	0
knew	1
in	0
the	0
apartment	0
searching	1
for	0
this	0
cat	0

yes	1
i	0
understand	0

and	0
they	0
laughed	1
at	0
me	0
they	0
thought	0
that	0
was	0
so	0
[laughter-hysterical]	1

oh	0
no	0
i	1
understand	0
we	0
have	0
uh	0
we've	0
gone	0
through	0
the	0
same	1
thing	1
with	0
ours	0
we've	0
cut	0
you	0
know	0
they've	0
been	0
ill	0
i	0
mean	0
i	1
take	0
off	0
work	1
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
my	0
cats	1
you	0
know	0
th[e]	0

oh	0
[laughter-yeah]	1

my	0
boss	1
thinks	0
i'm	0
absolutely	0
crazy	0

and	0
then	0
we	1
had	0
a	1
baby	1
and	1
its	0
like	1
all	1
right	1
who	0
comes	0
first	1
the	0
cat	1
or	0
the	0
baby	1

the	0
cat	1
was	0
here	1
first	1
so	1
i	0
know	1
it's	1
hard	1

and	0
and	0
then	0
when	0
we	0
go	0
to	0
sleep	1
at	0
night	0
you	0
know	0
it's	0
like	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
to	0
try	0
to	0
get	0
any	1
space	0
on	0
the	0
bed	1
because	0
we	0
have	0
all	0
four	1
of	0
them	0
up	0
there	0
with	1
us	0

oh	0
how	0
funny	1

it's	1
like	0
all	1
right	0
whose	1
corners	0
is	0
this	0
one	0

that's	0
sweet	1
i	0
have	0
the	1
two	1
the	0
other	1
two	0
cats	0
i	0
have	0
are	0
outdoor	1
cats	0

oh	0
uh-huh	0

and	0
they	1
didn't	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
actually	1
but	0
they	0
got	0
kind	0
of	0
wild	1
and	0
weren't	0
doing	0
very	0
well	1
[laughter-inside]	1
so	0
i	0
put	0
them	1
outside	1
once	0
i	1
got	0
a	1
house	1
and	0
they're	0
doing	0
great	1
out	1
there	0
they	0
love	1
it	1
but	0
the	0
other	1
one	0
the	0
first	1
one	1
i	1
got	1
he	1
doesn't	0
want	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	0
outside	1
unless	1
you're	0
there	1

oh	0
uh-huh	0

other	0
than	0
that	1
he	1
gets	0
scared	1
to	0
death	1
if	0
you	1
shut	1
that	0
door	1
he	0
goes	0
into	1
hiding	1

oh	0
no	1

i	1
think	0
it's	1
from	1
the	0
time	1
he	1
jumped	1
off	0
the	0
[laughter-balcony]	1
and	1

yes	1
uh-huh	0
that's	1
it	1

and	1
lord	0
knows	1
what	1
happened	1
to	0
him	1
[laughter-but]	1
[laughter-he's]	1
probably	0
been	0
through	0
all	1
kinds	0
of	1
nightmares	1

[laughter-right]	0
traumatized	1
for	1
life	1
here	0

probably	1

oh	0
yeah	0
we've	0
all	1
four	0
of	0
ours	0
are	0
house	0
cats	0

are	1
they	0

we	0
started	1
out	0
with	0
two	0
with	0
two	0
outdoor	1
cats	0
but	0
our	1
neighbor	0
decided	1
he	1
didn't	0
like	0
cats	0
and	1
shot	1
one	0
of	1
them	0

oh	0
no	1

oh	1
well	0
he	0
lived	1
through	0
it	1
oh	0
i	1
couldn't	0
believe	1
it	0
we	0
went	0
through	1
like	0
twenty	1
two	1
hundred	0
dollars	1
worth	0
of	0
vet	1
bills	1
the	0

oh	0
my	1
gosh	1

the	0
the	0
cat	1
almost	1
died	0
and	1
but	1
he	0
turned	0
out	0
to	0
be	1
such	1
a	0
wonderful	0
cat	1
oh	0
he	0
loves	1
life	0
now	1

uh	1
i	1
imagine	1

and	0
he's	1
like	1
oh	0
thank	1
you	1
so	0
much	0

i	0
wonder	1
how	1
many	1
of	0
his	0
lives	1
he	1
[laughter-missed]	1
when	0
that	1
happened	1

i	1
know	1
we	1
wondered	0
about	1
that	1
but	1
uh	0
oh	0
that	1
was	1
a	0
traumatic	1
experience	1
for	1

going	1
to	1
talk	1
about	0

spending	1
time	1
with	1

is	0
a	0
big	0
issue	1
with	0
us	1
although	0
i	0
don't	0
recall	1
marking	1
it	0
on	0
my	0
little	0
things	1

are	0
looking	1
for	1
uh	0
words	0
to	0
be	0
said	1
like	0
day	1
care	0
and	0

is	1
i	1
mean	1
there	1
are	1
some	0
real	0
issues	1
here	1
um	1
that	0
i	0
think	1
um	0

uh-huh	0

i	1
don't	1
know	0
it's	0
an	1
interesting	1
phenomena	1
i	0
happen	1
to	0
um	0
i'm	0
a	0
pediatrician	1

oh	0

my	0
husband	1
is	0
a	0
physician	1
so	0
um	0
i	0
i	1
teasingly	1
i	0
talk	0
to	0
parents	0
about	0
this	0
a	0
lot	1
uh	0
children	1
i	0
i	0
think	1
working	1
mothers	0
or	0
mothers	1
who	0
choose	1
to	0
work	0
outside	1
the	1
home	1
um	0
need	0
very	1
early	1
to	1
come	1
to	0
grips	1
with	1
any	0
guilt	1
that	0
they	0
feel	1
and	0
decide	1
what's	0
best	1
for	0
them	1
and	0
their	0
family	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	1
feel	0
when	0
my	0
children	0
were	1
very	1
young	1
i	0
had	1
jobs	1
that	1
helped	1
me	0
be	1
flexible	1
with	0
my	0
schedule	0
and	1
spend	0
time	1
with	1
them	0
and	1
all	1
that	1
sort	0
of	1
thing	1
and	0
i	1
long	1
ago	1
decided	0
i'm	0
a	0
better	0
mother	1
because	0
i	0
work	0
outside	0
the	0
home	1
i	0

um-hum	0

i	0
really	1
believe	1
that	0
and	0
it	0
has	0
um	0
helped	1
us	0
to	0
afford	1
some	0
things	1
for	0
our	0
children	0
that	0
we	0
couldn't	0
otherwise	1
that	0
i	0
think	0
are	0
wonderful	1
particularly	0
at	0
this	0
age	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
our	0
kids	0
are	0
real	1
secure	1
and	1
have	0
a	0
real	1
sense	1
of	0
priorities	1
and	0
that	0
they	0
can	0
do	0
anything	1
and	0
be	0
anything	1
both	0
male	1
and	0
female	0
a	0
lot	0

um-hum	0

so	0
i	0
know	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
rationalization	1
but	1
it's	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
it's	0
true	1
for	0
our	1
family	0
and	0

well	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
has	0
worked	1
very	0
well	0

yeah	0
it's	0
like	0
you	0
said	0
it's	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
each	1
his	0
own	1
i	0
mean	1
we're	0
planning	0
on	0
having	0
my	1
wife	0
stay	0
home	0
and	0
but	0

there's	1
no	0
question	1
i	0
think	0
that's	0
really	1
the	0
best	1
if	0
if	0
a	0
woman	1
is	0
happy	0
doing	0
that	0

um-hum	0

i	0
hate	1
to	0
put	0
it	0
quite	1
that	0
way	1

yeah	0

i	0
was	0
twenty	1
nine	0
when	0
i	0
had	0
my	0
first	1
child	0
and	0
um	0
i	1
would	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
real	1
fulfilled	1
i	0
really	1
would	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
totally	1
staying	0
home	1
with	0
a	0
young	0
child	1
it's	0

um-hum	0

it's	0
a	0
wonderful	1
it's	0
wonderful	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
mother	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
liked	0
i	0
like	0
the	0
way	1
i	0
did	0
it	0

right	1

i	1
sort	0
of	0
worked	0
half	1
time	0
i	0
had	0
very	1
flexible	0
hours	1
i	0
nursed	0
all	1
three	0
of	0
our	0
children	0
till	0
they	0
were	0
at	0
least	1
a	0
year	1
and	0
i	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
that	0
despite	1
working	0
very	1
easily	0
which	0
is	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
i	0
preach	1
all	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
to	0
mothers	1

oh	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
we	0
choose	1
very	1
very	0
carefully	1
the	0
um	0
alternative	0
situations	1
that	0
we	0
had	1
them	0
in	0

um-hum	0

some	0
babysitting	1
groups	0
again	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
rationalization	1
but	0
i	0
really	0
do	1
think	0
sometimes	0
they	0
very	1
early	0
on	0
are	0
around	0
lots	1
of	0
other	0
children	0
and	0
they	0
they	0
learn	1
to	0
share	1
and	0
they	0
learn	1
not	0
necessarily	1
to	0
be	0
the	0
center	0
of	0
attention	1
but	0
that	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	0
we	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
sure	1
they're	0
secure	1

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
that	0
helps	1

well	0
that's	0
good	1
sounds	0
like	0
you're	0
have	0
a	0
handle	1
on	0
it	0

oh	0
yeah	0
hope	0
so	1
so	0
your	0
wife	1
does	0
she	0
work	1
right	0
now	1

um	0
no	1
not	0
right	0
now	1
right	0

she's	0
out	0

right	0
right	0
well	0

just	0

for	0
a	0
couple	1
years	0

still	0
trying	1
to	0
dry	0

no	0
problem	1
here	1
yeah	0

really	0

but	0

when	0

got	1
a	0
male	1
siamese	1
about	1

uh	0
you	1
know	1
they're	1
just	0
uh	1
aggressive	1

nature	1

uh-huh	1

been	0
neutered	1
and	0
declawed	1
so	0
and	0
he's	1
an	1
indoor	1
cat	0
so	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
uh	0
that	0
kind	1
of	1
calms	1
him	1
down	1
for	0
the	1
most	1
part	0

how	0
about	1
yours	1

well	1
yeah	1
he's	1
uh	0
he	0
has	1
been	1
really	1
aggressive	1
at	0
especially	1
towards	0
my	0
little	0
girl	1
for	0
some	1
reason	1

huh	0

he's	0
uh	1
been	0
so	1
mean	1
to	0
her	1

and	1
and	0
you	0
say	1
you	0
had	0
him	0
how	1
long	1

we've	1
had	1
him	1
for	0
about	1
two	1
years	1
and	1

two	1
years	1

and	1
and	1
he	0
was	1
so	1
mean	1
to	0
her	1
um	0
right	0
after	1
we	0
first	0
got	1
him	0
so	1
we	0
had	1
him	0
neutered	1
and	0
and	0
declawed	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
bites	1
her	0
[laughter-he]	1
[laughter-can't]	1
scratch	1
her	0
[laughter-anymore]	1
he	1

huh	0

he	1
bites	1
her	0

does	0
he	0
bite	1
her	1
enough	1
to	0
draw	0
blood	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
he	0
has	1
a	1
couple	0
of	1
times	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
he's	1
a	0
very	1
possessive	1
cat	1
he	1
he	1
loves	1
my	0
son	1
it's	0
his	1
cat	1
and	1
he's	1
the	0
only	1
one	1
that	0
allows	1
him	1
to	0
touch	1
him	1
or	0
pet	1
him	0
or	1
love	1
him	1

yeah	1

and	1
he's	1
so	0
funny	1
he	0
just	0
follows	1
my	0
son	1
around	0
just	0
like	0
a	0
dog	1

huh	0

won't	1
even	1

wants	0
to	1
get	0
in	1
the	0
bathroom	1
and	0
while	0
he	0
showers	1
it's	0
so	1
hilarious	1
so	0
he's	1
quite	1
a	1
animal	1

yeah	1
boy	1
i	0
guess	1
well	0
as	0
long	1
as	0
he	0
doesn't	0
get	0
too	1
aggressive	1
i	0
guess	1
with	0
the	0
daughter	1
he's	1
all	1
right	0
you	0

yeah	1

you	0
wouldn't	0
want	1
him	0
to	0
carry	1
her	0
off	1
or	0
something	0

yeah	1
well	1
we	1
we	0
did	1
uh	1
actually	0
take	0
him	0
to	0
the	0
pound	1
a	0
couple	0
of	0
times	1
you	1
know	1
because_1	1
we	1
just	0
couldn't	1
have	1
him	0
being	1
so	1
so	0
aggressive	1
towards	0
the	0
girl	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

sure	1

but	0
uh	0
he	0
seems	1
to	0
have	1
mellowed	0
out	1
a	0
little	0
bit	1
and	0
we	0
do	1
keep	1
our	1
daughter	1
away	1
from	0
him	1
so	0

yeah	1
yeah	0

were	1
it	0
not	1
for	0
my	0
son	1
the	0
cat	1
would	0
not	0
be	1
in	0
this	0
house	1

is	0
that	1
the	0
only	1
pet	0
that	0
you	1
have	1

it	1
is	1
uh-huh	1
we've	0
we	0
tried	1
a	0
dog	1
um	1
about_1	1
four	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
we	0
ended	0
up	1
with	0
a	0
oh	1
malamute	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
kind	0
of	1
mix	1
anyway	1
it	0
was	0
it	1
ended	1
up	1
being	0
just	1
a	0
huge	1
huge	0
dog	1
that	0
ate	1
us	0
out	0
of	0
house	1
and	0
home	1
so	0
we	0
gave	0
him	1
up	0
and	1
tried	0

well	1
do	1
you	1
live	1
you	0
you	0
in	0
a	1
house	1
or	0
a	0
place	1
where	0
you	0
uh	0

yes	1
uh-huh	1
we're	1
in	0
a	0
house	1
but	0
we're	1
in	0
a	0
subdivision	1
where	0
we	0
really	1
can't	0
allow	0
the	0
dog	1
we	0

i	1
see	0

we	0
couldn't	0
allow	1
him	0
to	0
run	0
free	1
so	0
he	1
was	0
just	0
chained	0
up	1
all	0
the	0
time	0
and	0
it	1
was	0
it	0
was	0
unfortunate	1

sure	1

so	0
have	0
you	0
tried	1
any	0
other	0
pets	1

no	1
no	0
i	0
i	1
live	0
alone	1
in	0
an	0
apartment	1
and	0
uh	0
it's	0
it's	0
not	1
that	0
big	1
that	0
uh	0

oh	1

although	1
i've	0
heard	1
rabbits	1
are	0
pretty	1
good	0

oh	1

you	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
saw	1
something	0
on	0
cnn	1
or	0
on	0
cable	1
here	0
uh	0
a	0
while	1
ago	1
that	0
showed	0
some	0
people	1
that	0
had	0
rabbits	1
in	0
apartments	0
and	0
in	0
houses	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

oh	1
my	0
word	1

and	0
they	1
apparently	1
uh	0
especially	0
when	0
they're	0
young	1
when	0
they	0
bring	0
them	0
in	1

oh	1
my	1
word	1

uh	0

and	1
do	1
they	0
they	0
just	0
paper	1
train	0
it	0
or	0
something	1

i	0
[laughter-guess]	1

i	0
guess	1
yeah	0
and	0
i	1
would	0
imagine	1
that	0
they	0
don't	0
have	0
many	0
more	0
than	0
one	1
to	0
start	1
with	1
either	0
because_1	0

yeah	1
well	0
rabbits	1
are	0
darling	1
that	0
would	0
be	0
fun	1
if	0
you	0
could	0
get	0
them_1	0
trained	1
otherwise	1
they're	0
pretty	0
smelly	1

yep	1
that's	0
right	1

um	0

did	0
you	1
see	0
the	0
the	0
cnn	1
the	0
the	0
dog	1
show	0
uh	0

huh-uh	0

and	1
uh	0
yes	1

what'd	0
you	0

[laughter-back]	1

you	0
didn't	1

do	0
anything	1
uh	0

do	0
they	1
have	1
a	1
limit	1

a	0
limit	1
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1
i	0
know	1
i	1
my	0
home	1
is	0
in	0
uh	1
pensacola	1
florida	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

a	0
lot	1
of	1
shark	0
fishing	1
in	0
that	1
you	1
know	1
in	0
the	0
gulf	1

i	1
was	0
able	0
to	0
do	1
uh	0
when	0
i	1
could	0
go	0
in	1
and	0
go	0
down	1
and	1
actually	1
pick	1
them	0
off	0
the	1
[laughter-bottom]	1

right	1

hand	1
picked	1

[laughter-that's]	1
[laughter-right]	1

the	0
weirdest	1
fishing	1
experience	1
i	0
ever	1
had	1
and	0
uh	0
people	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
are	0
still	1
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
if	0
i	0
really	1
caught	1
what	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
caught	1
we	1
were	0
in	1
uh	0
rockport	1
which	0
is	0
close	1
to	0
corpus	1

um-hum	0

and	0
we	0
had	0
been	1
fishing	1
in	0
a	0
canal	1
they	0
had	0
all	1
these	0
canals	1
up	0
through	0
this	1
one	0
little	0
retirement	1
area	0
and	1
uh	0
we'd	1
been	0
fishing	1
in	0
the	0
canals	1
and	0
all	1
we	0
were	0
catching	0
were	0
catfish	1
and	0
we	0
were	0
pretty	0
bored	1
with	0
that	1
so	0
we	0
thought	1
well	0
maybe	1
there	0
are	0
some	0
crab	1
in	0
here	1
we'll	0
try	1
to	0
catch	0
some	0
crab	1
so	0
i	1
got	0
my	0
chicken	1
neck	1
and	0
all	0
my	0
little	1
net	1
and	0
everything	1
and	0
something	1
i	0
had	0
a	1
rock	1
to	0
weight	1
it	0
down	1
something	0
grabs	1
and	0
just	0
runs	1
with	0
it	0
and	0
of	0
course	1
there's	0
no	0
hook	1
so	1
it	0
can't	1
be	0
a	0
fish	1

um-hum	0

i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
it's	0
not	0
a	0
fish	1
right	1
and	1
crab	1
they	0
don't	1
bite	1
like	0
that	1
they	1
don't	0
just	0
run	1
with	0
your	0
food	1
so	1
i	0
netted	1
it	0
and	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
ugliest	1
fish	0
i've	0
ever	1
seen	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
it	0
had	0
real	1
teeth	1
like	0
human	1
teeth	1
and	0
it	1
looked	1
archaic	1
i	1
i	0
had	0
no	1
idea	0
what	0
it	0
was	1
i	0
called	1
my	0
father	1
long	1
distance	1
just	0
to	0
describe	1
the	0
thing	1
and	0
it	0
had	1
the	0
rock	1
in	0
it's	0
mouth	1
it	1
not	1
the	0
chicken	1
but	0
the	0
rock	1
itself	1
is	0
what	1
it	0
had	0
grabbed	1

hm	1

they	0
say	1
it's	0
a	0
dogfish	1
from	0
everything	1
i've	0
described	1
it	0
was	0
brown	1
with	0
these	0
little	0
white	1
dots	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
made	0
a	0
loud	1
kind	0
of	0
almost	1
a	0
croaking	1
noise	0
like	0
a	0
croaker	1
does	1

uh-huh	0

it	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
strangest	1
thing	1
it	1
oh	1
i'll	0
never	1
get	0
over	1
that	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	0
get	0
in	0
the	0
water	1
anywhere	1
around	0
salt	1
water	0
because	0
i'm	0
sure	1
one	0
of	0
those	0
fish	1
are	0
there	1

well	0
we	1
used	0
to	1
i	1
guess	0
the	0
weirdest	1
thing	0
i've	1
ever	0
caught	1
is	1
uh	0
in	1
some	1
of	0
the	1
inlets	1
and	0
the	0
rivers	1
around	1
rehoboth	1
delaware	1

um-hum	0

they	1
have	0
a	0
fish	1
that's	0
called	1
an	0
oyster	1
cracker	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
you've	0
ever	0
heard	1
of	0
it	0

i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0
that	0
one	1

and	1
it	0
has	1
a	0
huge	1
strong	1
mouth	1
and	0
they	0
actually	1
uh	0
use	1
their	0
teeth	1
to	0
open	1
oysters	1

that's	0
where	1
it	0
gets	0
its	0
name	1
obviously	1
huh	1

um-hum	0
and	0
this	1
is	0
the	0
ugliest	1
fish	1
i	0
have	1
ever	1
seen	0
and	1

and	1
i	0
me[an]	0
and	0
they	1
come	1
in	0
all	0
si[ze]	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
i've	1
caught	0
them	1
from	1
you	1
know	0
three	1
or	0
four	0
inches	1
long	1
up	1
to	0
uh	0

um-hum	0

i	1
guess	0
the	1
la[rgest]	0
largest	1
one	0
i	0
ever	0
caught	1
was	0
probably	0
eight	1
or	0
ten	1
inches	0
long	0
but	0
just	1
huge	1
ugly	1
things	1
just	0
terrible	1

huh	1

can	0
you	0
eat	1
them	0

no	1
no	1

ooh	1
i	1
i	0
don't	1
think	0
i'd	0
want	1
to	0
even	1
if	0
you	0
could	1
if	0
they're	0
that	0
ugly	1
but	1

they	1
just	0
they	0
just	1
look	1
as	0
though	0
you	0
do	0
not	1
want	0
to	0
do	0
anything	0
with	1
them	0

that's	0
like	1
this	0
dogfish	1
it	0
was	1
it	1
scared	0
me	0
to	0
death	1

um-hum	0

it	0
was	0
u[gly]	1
it	0
really	1
it	0
didn't	1
look	0
like	1
it	0
looked	1
like	0
it	0
was	0
something	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
dark	1
ages	0
that	0
just	0
never	0
died	1

well	0
the	0
first	1
time	0
i	0
went	1
uh	0
surf	1
fishing	0
was	0
in	1
and	0
i	0
threw	1
my	0
line	0
out	1
and	1
the	0
first	1
thing	0
i	0
caught	1
was	0
a	0
sand	1
shark	0
which	0
was	0
probably	1
a	0
foot	1
and	0
a	0
half	1
or	1
uh	0
two	1
feet	0
long	1

and	0
scared	1
me	0
to	0
death	1

oh	0

i	0
i	1
had	0
never	1
seen	1
anything	0
and	0
then	1
i	1
was	0
fi[shed]	1
fished	1
for	0
another	0
half	1
hour	0
or	0
forty	0
five	0
minutes	0
caught	1
a	0
few	0
white	1
fish	1
and	0
so	1
forth	0
and	0
then	0
i	1
felt	0
something	1
relatively	0
heavy	1
and	0
i	1
thought	0
oh	1
really	1
here	1
i'm	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
get	1
one	0

and	1
i	0
pulled	1

uh	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
uh	1
to	1
jury	1
trials	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
i	1
really	1
feel	0
as	1
though	1
uh	1
jury	1
trials	1
are	0
are	1
uh	1
whatever	1
system	1
has	0
been	1
been	0
used	1
historically	1
in	1
particular	1
jurisdiction	1
you	0
know	1
is	1
really	1
the	0
the	0
only	1
kinds	1
of	0
things	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
use	1
because	0
the	0
the	0
jurisprudence	1
is	1
you	0
know	1
based	1
on	1
on	0
uh	1
you	1
know	0
on	1
accumulated	1
body	1
of	1
law	1
and	0
if	1
if	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
situation	1
where	0
you	0
change	1
that	0
body	0
of	0
law	1
then	1
all	0
of	1
sudden	1
they	0
they	1
start	1
they	0
could	1
start	1
going	1
back	1
and	1
digging	1
up	1
all	1
these	0
cases	1
that	0
uh	1
that	1
would	0
be	0
handled	1
differently	1
were	0
they	0
judged	1
by	0
today's	0
standards	1
so	0

um	1

so	0
i	0
i	0
really	1
don't	0
think	1
it	0
th[ey]	0
they	0
can	0
really	0
do	1
much	0
of	1
anything	0
to	0
change	1
it	1
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	1

i	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
so	1
possibly	1
in	1
the	1
jury	1
selection	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
only	1

just	1
for	1
example	1
what	1
we're	1
seeing	1
in	1
california	1
i	1
guess	1
yeah	1
it	1
makes	1
you	1
wonder	1
um	1
had	1
the	0
jury	1
been	0
a	1
different	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
what	1
would've	0
happened	1
with	1
that	1
outcome	1
um	1
and	0
and	0
the	0
problems	1
that	1
that	0
has	0
come	1
that	0
has	0
come	1
from	1
this	1
decision	1
that	0
that	0
jury	0
came	1
to	0
after	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
witnessed	1
what	1
we	0
did	1
with	1
the	1
video	1
tape	0
beating	1
um	0
just	1
makes	0
you	0
wonder	1
i	0
guess	1
whether	1
or	0
not	1
they	1

well	0
won't	1
well	0
maybe	1
they	0
used	1
a	0
little	1
bit	0
too	0
much	0
force	1
with	0
stuff	1
like	0
that	0
but	0
then	1
then	1
you	0
know	1
the	0
defense	1
lawyer	0
addressed	0
each	1
and	0
every	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
blows	1
apparently	1

um-hum	0

and	1
you	0
know	1
the	0
other	1
two	0
guys	1
sat	1
in	0
the	0
car	1

that's	1
that	1
um-hum	0

um-hum	0

and	0
they	1
didn't	0
get	1
beat	1
up	1
you	0
know	1
rodney	1

no	1
um-hum	1

rodney	1
got	0
beat	1
up	0
because	1
he	0
he	0
you	0
know	1
he	0
pur[poses]	0
you	1

um	0
i	0
understand	1
why	0

thing	1
hey	1
the	0
bu[nch]	0
the	0
average	1
person	1
is	0
gonna	0
take	1
a	0
look	1
at	0
that	0
and	0
say	1
suspicions	1
confirmed	1
they're	0
a	0
bunch	1
of	0
animals	1
you	1
know	0
how	1
can	0
you	0
really	1
deal	1
with	0
an	0
environment	1
where	0
you're	0
gonna	0
lose	1
everything	1
forty	1
deaths	1
i	0
mean	0
there	0
are	0
forty	1
people	1
that	0
are	0
dead	1
as	0
a	0
result	0
of	0
that	0

i	0
know	1

that's	1
really	0
ridiculous	1

and	0
i'm	1
just	0
trying	1
to	0
determine	1
you	1
know	0
how	1
you	0
address	0
and	0
how	0
you	0
weigh	1
you	0
know	0
rodney	1
getting	1
getting	1
the	0
the	0
hell	1
beat	0
out	0
of	0
him	0
against	0
you	1
know	0
forty	1
deaths	0

against	1
forty	1
other	0
people	1
being	0

yeah	1
and	0
there's	0
no	1
other	1
i	0
i'm	0
not	1
su[re]	0
exactly	1
sure	1
uh	0
what	1
the	0
circumstances	1
surrounding	1
the	0
deaths	1
and	0
i'm	0
very	1
upset	0
that	0
the	0
news	1
media	0
has	0
not	0
identified	1
those	0
deaths	1
and	0
and	0
pursued	1
it	0
you	1
know	0
because	0
i'm	0
interested	1
in	0
the	0
circumstances	1
surrounding	1
this	0
thing	0

those	0
deaths	1

um-hum	0

is	0
it	0
a	0
looter	1
that	0
got	0
shot	1
by	0
a	0
store	1
owner	0
i	0
you	1
know	0
no	0
tears	1

or	0
just	0
a	0
by[stander]	1
an	0
innocent	0
bystander	1
or	0
somebody	0
got	0
actually	0
beat	0
to	0
death	1
or	0
what	1

yeah	1
and	0
and	0
so	1
i	0
but	0
i	0
i	0
suspect	1
a	0
number	1
of	0
them_1	0

um	0

you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
see	0
film	1
of	0
people	1
being	0
pulled	1
out	0
of	0
a	0
car	1
and	0
shot	1
you	0
know	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
street	1

it	0
uh	1
or	0
or	0
beaten	1

and	0
and	0
my	1
reaction	0
is	0
i	1
would've	0
run	0
over	0
fifty	0
people	1
before	0
rather	1
than	0
stop	1
and	0
uh	0
and	0
th[ere]	0
there	1
would've	0
been	0
just	0
uh	0
nothing	0
but	0
carnage	1
after	0
after	0
if	0
i'd	1
been	0
at	0
the	0
wheel	0

right	1

no	1
one	0
would've	0
stopped	1
me	0

right	1

that's	1
that's	1
exactly	0
how	0
i	1
feel	0
too	1
i	1
wouldn't	1
have	0
uh	1
they	0
wouldn't	1
have	0
stopped	0
my	0
car	1
for	0
any	0
anything	1
had	0
i	1
seen	0
them	0
coming	1
but	0
i	1
was	0
just	1
wondering	1
since	0
you	1
were	1
you're	1
in	0
you're	0
back	1
east	1
um	1
and	0
a	0
little	1
closer	0
to	0
the	0
the	0
bigger	1
cities	0
probably	1
than	0
we	1
are	0
in	0
idaho	1
here	1

right	1
i'm	0
inside	1
the	0
beltway	1

oh	0

you	0
know	0
how	0
capital	1
gang	1
they	0
always	0
say	1
well	1
inside	1
the	0
beltway	1
they	0
think	0
thus	1
and	0
so	1
and	0
i	0
say	0
well	0
wait	1
a	0
minute	0
i'm	1
inside	0
the	0
beltway	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
like	0
that	1

um-hum	0

i'm	0
a	0
government	1
employee	1

oh	0
in	0
what	1
uh	0
section	1
of	0
the	0
government	1
do	0
you	0
work	0

i'm	1
with	0
the	0
fbi	1

[laughter-oh]	0
oh	0
that's	0
[laughter-interesting]	1

yes	1
an[d]	0
and	0
so	0
um	0
uh	0
and	0
and	0
the	0
reason	1
i'm	0
doing	1
this	0
whole	1
thing	1
is	0
because	1
you	0
know	1
rick	1
who	0
is	0
another	1
government	0
employee	1
wanted	1
a	0
spee[ch]	0
segments	1
of	0
my	0
speech	1
that	0
uh	0
were	0
done	1
a	0
year	1
ago	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
he	0
wanted	1
another	1
collection	0
a	0
year	0
later	1

oh	0

and	0
so	1
this	0
is	0
my	0
seventh	1
call	1
a	0
year	1
ago	0
i	0
did	0
eleven	1
calls	0

oh	0
i	0
see	1

and	0
so	1
that's	1
that's	1
why	0
uh	0
uh	0
tha[t's]	0
that's	1
why	0
i'm	0
religiously	1
getting	0
on	0
the	0
phone	1
because	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
unique	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
unique	1
situation	1
here	0
in	0
that	0
if	0
i	0
don't	1
participate	0

okay	1

okay	1
i	1
thought	0
it	1
was	0
supposed	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
recording	1
but	1
anyway	1
um	1
well	1
i	0
i	0
do	1
take	0
care	0
of	0
pretty	0
much	1
[laughter-all]	1
of	1
the	1
stuff	1
for	1
for	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
for	0
me	1
and	0
um	0
i	1
embarrassed	1
to	1
say	0
it's	1
pretty	1
trivial	1

um-hum	1

all	1
we	1
all	1
i	1
do	0
is	1
uh	0
keep	1
a	0
list	0
of	0
things	1
like	0
debts	1
that	0
are	0
outstanding	1
and	0
and	1
every	1
two	0
or	0
three	1
months	0
update	1
that	0
and	0
every	1
once	0
in	0
a	1
while	1
make	0
a	0
list	1
of	0
what	0
we	0
spent	0
that	0
month	1
but	1
i	0
doubt	1
i	0
do	0
it	0
more	0
than	0
three	0
times	0
a	0
year	1

um-hum	0
do	1
you	0
use	0
a	1
computer	1

and	0

no	1
i	0
work	1
with	0
them_1	0
all	0
day	0
yeah	0
i'm	0
in	0
computer	0
science	1
yet	0
i	0
i	0
do	0
everything	0
on	0
paper	1

oh	0

uh-huh	1

uh	0
i	1
don't	0
even	0
use	0
a	0
calculator	1
for	0
the	0
stuff	0
i'm	0
doing	1
because_1	0
it's	0
all	1
pretty	0
round	1
numbers	0

yeah	1
mine	1
is	0
really	0
simple	1
because	0
i	1
got	0
all	1
our	0
bills	0
paid	0
off	1
when	1
um	1
he	1
was	1
a	0
marine	1
he	1
went	0
to	1
saudi	1
arabia	1
and	1
while	0
he	1
was	0
gone	1
i	1
got	0
all	1
of	0
our	1
bills	1
paid	0
off	1
so	1
really	1
the	1
only	1
bills	1
i	0
have	1
is	1
rent	1
utilities	1
insurance	1
you	1
know	1
so	1

um-hum	0

so	1
they	0
come	1
in	1
i	1
pay	1
them_1	0
and	1
that's	0
it	1
[laughter-you]	1
[laughter-know]	0
that's	0
about	1
the	0
extent	1
of	1
it	0
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
i	0

i	1
don't	1
really	0
have	1
this	1
major	1
budget	1
or	0
anything	1
i	1
just	1
really	1
i'm	1
real	1
thrifty	1
i	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	1
know	1
two	0
children	1
and	0
me	1
and	1
um	1
just	1
real	1
careful	1
with	0
the	1
money	1
you	1
know	0
what	0
little	1
we	0
have	1

um-hum	0

so	1
that's	1
what	0
i	1
do	0

yeah	1
it's	1
a	1
pretty	1
straightforward	1
it's	1
almo[st]	1
i	1
can't	1
imagine	0
having	1
to	1
go	0
into	1
real	1
complicated	1
stuff	1
and	1
making	0
you	0
know	1
fancy	1
budgets	1
it	1

no	1

it	1
seems	1
like	1
if	0
you're	1
getting	1
to	0
that	1
level	0
y[ou're]	1
you're	0
not	1
in	0
real	0
good	1
control	1

huh-uh	0
you	1
know	1
i	1
mean	1
i	0
i	1
i've	0
never	1
liked	1
credit	1
cards	1
and	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
debt	1
you	1
know	0
you	0

uh-huh	0

you	0
buy	1
something	0
on	0
credit	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
you	0
pay	0
twice	0
as	0
much	1
for	0
it	0
when	0
you	0
get	0
done	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	0

so	1

actually	1
i'm	0
i	0
me[an]	1
i	0
like	1
using	1
credit	0
cards	0
for	1
everything	1
but	1
just	1
paying	1
off	0
the	1
bills	1
because	0
that	1
way	0
it's	1
a	0
record	1
of	1
everything	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	0
don't	1
have	0
to	0
worry	1
about	1
keeping	1
[laughter-records]	1
of	0
anything	1
else	1
because	1
they	0
come	1
in	0
at	0
the	1
end	1
of	0
the	0
month	1

i	0
don't	1
have	0
too	1
many	0
wea[knesses]	0
i	0
don't	1
have	1
too	0
many	1
weaknesses	1
but	1

but	1
i	1
found	1
out	0
a	1
credit	1
card	0
was	0
one	1
of	1
them_1	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0

uh	0

it's	0
so	1
much	0
easy	1
easier	1
you	0
know	1
if	0
something's	1
on	1
sale	1
if	0
you're	1
a	0
woman	1
and	1
you're	1
a	1
sale	1
person	0
it's	0

it's	0
like	0
oh	1
well	0
that's	0
on	0
sale	1
let's	1
go	0
grab	1
it	0
you	1
know	1
so	1
um	0
and	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
money	1
then	0
use	0
the	0
credit	1
card	0
so	1
i	1
got	0
rid	1
of	0
them	0
credit	1
cards	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
that's	0
if	0
that's	0
a	0
weakness	1
that's	0
a	0
good	0
thing	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	1
that	1
was	0
my	0
weakness	1
it	1
wasn't	0
bad	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
didn't	1
have	1
like	0
thousands	1
of	0
dollars	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
like	0
that	1
just	0
i	1
just	0
learned	1
that	0
that	0
wasn't	0
for	0
me	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

sure	1

so	1
but	1
i	1
self	1
employed	1
you	0
know	0
i	1
have	0
my	0
own	1
little	0
cleaning	1
business	1
type	0
thing	0
so	0
um	1
i	0
keep	0

do	1
you	1
find	1
trouble	1
keeping	0
the	0
records	0
for	0
taxes	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
or	0

no	1
it's	0
not	0
hard	1
i	0
just	1
keep	0
it	0
in	0
a	0
notebook	1
and	0
write	1
down	0
what	1
i've	0
made	1
and	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
what	1
it's	0
gonna	0
have	0
to	0
go	1
for	1
that	0
month	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0
not	1
that	0
not	0
that	0
hard	1
not	0
at	0
all	1

uh-huh	1

well	0
that's	1
good	0
to	0
know	1

so	1
i	1
always	0
do	1
my	0
own	0
income	1
tax	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	1

i	0
don't	1
understand	0
the	0
idea	0
of	0
paying	1
somebody	0
to	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

huh	0

it	0
seems	1
like	0
it's	0
absurd	1
the	0
number	1
of	0
people	0
who	1
had	0
to	0
having	0
to	1
pay	1
somebody	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

rea[d]	1
all	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
read	1
a	0
book	1
i	1
mean	0
read	1
the	0
little	0
book	1
they	0
send	0
you	0
fill	1
in	0
the	1
blanks	1
and	0
go	1

i	0

yeah	1
just	0
the	0
form	1

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
it	0
seems	1
absurd	1
that	1
people	0
will	1
pay	1
you	0
know	1
some	0
bucks	1
just	1
to	0
get	0
someone	1
to	0

yeah	1
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them_1	0

it's	0
dumb	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
had	0
some	1
really	1
complicated	0
stuff	1
but	1
i	1
don't	0
so	1
i	1
don't	0
mess	1
with	0
it	1

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
don't	0
use	0
a	0
calculator	1
either	1
[laughter-you]	1
[laughter-know]	0
i	1

i	0
i	1
don't	0
trust	0
myself	0
with	0
using	0
a	0
calculator	1
or	0
computer	1
to	0
too	1
much	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
because	0
i	1
wanna	0
make	0
sure	0
that	0
that	0
i	0
i	1
keep	0
on	0
top	1
of	0
the	0
numbers	0
and	0
understand	1
what's	0
going	0
on	1
i	0

i	1
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
have	1
that	0
mu[ch]	0
that	1
many	0
you	1
know	1
things	0
to	0
add	0
up	1
so	0

i	0
know	0
too	1
many	0
people	0
who	0
use	0
a	1
calculator	1
if	1
they	0
make	1
a	0
mistake	1
they	1
find	0
out	0
two	1
months	0
later	1
because	1
they	0
weren't	1
paying	1
attention	1

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
yeah	0

and	0
we	1
have	0
a	0
i	0

i	1
bank	0
at	0
ncnb	0
here	0
and	0
they	1
have	0
a	0
number	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
call	1
in	0
and	0
i	1
always	0
call	0
in	0
like	1
once	1
every	0
other	0
week	0
or	0
so	0
and	0
i	0
will	0
um	0
check	0
off	1
what	0
checks	1
have	0
cleared	0
and	0

yeah	0

do	0
you	1
do	0
that	1

we	1
have	0
the	0
same	0
thing	1

you	0
do	0
too	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
always	0
check	0
them_1	0
off	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
check	0
my	0
balance	0
and	0
my	0
book	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
because_1	0
i	1
always	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
exactly	1
what	1
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	1

sure	1

i	0
do	0
that	1
real	1
often	0
i	0
do	1
that	1
so	0
anyway	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
i've	1
done	1
far	1
as	1
car	1
repairs	1
go	1
is	1
is	1
change	1
oil	1
and	1
filter	1
an	1
and	1
that	1
kind	1
of	0
stuff	1
i	0
haven't	1
gotten	1
really	1
involved	1
in	1
anything	1
uh	1
extensive	1
in	1
car	0
repairs	1
in	1
oh	1
oh	0
probably	1
a	0
year	1
or	0
so	1
i	0
think	0
the	0
last	1
thing	1
i	0
did	1
of	1
any	1
significance	1
was	1
change	1
the	0
water	1
pump	1
on	1
an	1
oldsmobile	1

yeah	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
similar	1
thing	1
that	1
i've	1
worked	1
on	1
cars	1
ever	0
since	1
i	1
was	1
uh	0
a	1
kid	1
and	0
that	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
ago	1
but	1
i've	1
gotten	1
to	1
the	0
point	1
where	0
uh	1
the	1
newer	1
cars	1
are	1
getting	0
so	1
complicated	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
that	1
uh	1
oh	1
most	1
of	0
the	1
cars	1
i	1
buy	1
i	1
try	0
to	1
buy	1
as	1
simple	1
a	1
car	1
as	1
possible	1

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
mean	0

so	0
you	0
know	1
changing	1
the	0
oil	1
changing	1
the	1
spark	1
plugs	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
them	0
now	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
don't	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
ignition	1
stuff	1
anymore	1
because	1
that's	0
all	1
solid	0
state	1
or	1
or	1
fuel	1
injected	1
so	0

yeah	0
they're	1
fuel	0
injected	0
and	0
so	0
there's	0

so	0
there	1
goes	0
the	1
carburetor	0
and	1
if	1
the	1
fuel	1
injection	0
system	0
breaks	0
down	1
there's	0
no	1
way	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
work	1
on	0
that	1

yeah	0

no	0
there's	0
no	0
way	1
somebody	0
once	1
said	0
uh	0
i	1
had	0
a	0
car	1
that	1
said	1
fuel	1
injection	0
on	1
the	0
side	1
of	0
it	1
and	0
a	1
woman	1
asked	0
me	0
what	0
that	0
meant	1
and	0
i	0
said	0
that	0
means	1
that	0
i	1
can't	1
work	1
on	0
it	0

oh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
basically	1
that's	0
it	1

you	0
know	1
they've	1
gotten	1
so	0
complicated	1
or	0
so	0
high	0
tech	1
that	0
uh	0
the	0
guys	1
average	0
guys	1
can't	1
really	0
go	0
out	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
garage	1
and	1
do	1
a	0
whole	0
lot	0
of	0
repairs	1
uh	0

yeah	0
i've	0
got	1
uh	1
an	0
eighty	1
four	1
chevy	0
van	1
that's	1
uh	1
a	0
one	1
ton	0
van	1
with	1
a	0
camper	1
conversion	1
on	0
it	0

yeah	0

it's	0
got	1
the	0
the	1
the	0
good	1
old	0
three	0
fifty	1
standard	1
engine	1
in	0
it	0

absolutely	0

regular	0
gas	0
engine	0
and	0
that	1
engine	0
i	0
understand	1
i	0
can	1
i	0
can	0
actually	1
work	1
on	0
that	0
engine	1

yeah	0
i	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
uh	1
chevy	1
van	1
it	1
was	0
a	0
short	1
van	1
that	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	1
in	0
it	0

yeah	0

uh-hum	0

and	1
basically	1
it	1
it	0
was	1
a	1
motor	1
and	0
you	1
didn't	1
have	0
all	1
the	1
other	0
junk	0
around	1
it	1

right	0

and	1
you	1
could	1
get	1
to	1
it	1
to	1
work	1
on	0
it	1

yeah	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
change	1
the	0
water	1
pump	0
in	0
that	1
here	1
about	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
and	1
it	0
was	1
really	1
fairly	0
easy	1
take	0
the	1
grill	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
radiator	1
out	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
just	0
stand	1
there	1
and	1
work	1
on	1
it	0

yeah	0
the	0
hardest	1
part	0
about	1
uh	0
water	1
pump	0
changes	1
is	0
getting	1
all	0
the	1
junk	1
off	0
before	1
you	0
can	1
get	1
too	1
it	1

well	1
that's	1
true	0
that	1
you're	0
right	0
you	1
know	0
by	0
the	0
time	0
you've	0
finally	1
got	0
down	1
to	0
it	1
i	0
was	0
hoping	1
i	1
could	0
remember	1
where	0
all	1
those	0
other	1
things	1
went	1

well	1
that's	0
kind	1
of	1
the	0
way	0
i	0
was	1
i	0
tried	1
to	0
remember	1
as	1
i	1
took	1
stuff	1
off	1
where	0
it	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
had	0
too	1
many	0
nuts	1
and	0
bolts	1
left	1
over	1
when	1
i	0
got	1
it	0
all	0
put	0
back	0
together	1

a	0
few	0
years	1
ago	0
i	1
had	1
an	1
oldsmobile	0
diesel	1
and	0
uh	1
the	0
uh	0
it	0
after	0
about	0
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	0
miles	1
the	0
injector	1
pump	0
went	1
out	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
uh	1
i	1
bought	1
it	1
when	1
we	0
were	1
living	1
in	0
lubbock	1
when	1
i	0
came	1
back	1
here	1
i	1
brought	0
the	1
car	1
back	1
here	1
and	1
uh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
diesels	0
got	0
pretty	1
unpopular	0
and	0
you	0
couldn't	1
sell	1
the	0
thing	1
i	1
mean	0
though	0
for	1
what	1
you	1
could	1
get	1
for	1
one	1
you	0
might	1
as	1
well	1
drive	1
it	0
over	0
a	1
cliff	1

oh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
the	0
injector	1
pump	0
went	0
bad	1
so	0
i	1
found	1
an	0
outfit	1
down	0
here	0
to	0
rebuild	1
it	0
and	1
uh	0
i	1
reinstalled	1
that	1
and	0

and	0
that	1
was	0
probably	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
miserable	1
things	0
i	0
had	0
gotten	0
into	1
in	0
a	0
long	0
time	1

i	0
don't	1
think	1
i'd	0
know	0
where	0
to	0
start	1
with	0
a	1
diesel	1

uh	0
well	0
if	0
you	0
know	0
diesels	1
don't	0
require	0
mechanics	1
they	0
require	0
plumbers	0

well	0
that's	0
true	0

and	0
uh	0

i	1
think	1
the	1
onl[y]	1
closest	1
thing	1
i've	0
come	1
to	0
to	0
a	0
diesel	1
is	1
i've	1
worked	1
for	0
a	0
tractor	1
repair	0
shop	1
uh	1
when	0
i	0
was	1
in	0
high	1
school	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
used	1
to	0
overhaul	1
farm	1
tractors	0
basically	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	0
were	1
nearly	0
all	1
all	1
diesel	1
but	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
cars	1
i've	0
never	1
never	1
been	0
involved	1
with	0
them	0

well	0
the	0
injector	1
nozzle	1
and	0
stuff	0
in	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
big	1
diesel	0
farm	1
tractors	1
you	0
know	1
what	1
are	0
about	0
the	0
size	1
of	0
your	1
thumb	1
and	1
the	0

well	1
ye[ah]	0
yeah	0
and	1
you	1
ca[n]	1
you	0
can	0
get	1
to	1
them	0

yeah	0
you	0
can	0
get	1
to	0
them	1
and	0
the	0
ones	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
diesel	1
cars	1
were	0
little	1
tiny	0
things	1
and	0
just	0
almost	1
impossible	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
with	0

well	0
i	0

i've	0
had	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
good	0
service	1
out	0
of	0
that	0
car	1
but	0
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
finally	1
gave	0
it	0
to	0
my	0
son	1
and	0
he	1
drove	0
it	0
literally	1
into	0
the	0
ground	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

yeah	0

he	0
was	0
out	0
at	0
tech	1
and	1
he	1
he	0
finished	1
it	1
off	1

i'm	0
i	1
guess	0
you're	0
right	1
the	0
the	0
diesel	1
has	0
almost	1
fallen	0
into	1
unpopular	1
status	1
i	1
don't	1
know	0
exactly	1
why	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
reasons	1
is	0
i	1
i'm	1
beginning	1
to	0
wonder	1
is	0
where	1
do	0
you	0
get	0
gas	1
at	0
i	0
su[re]	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
if	0
it's	0
still	1
uh	0
limited	1
like	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
don't	1
notice	1
it	0
probably	1
because	0
i	1
don't	1

what	0
the	0
availability	0

huh	0

you	0
mean	0
the	0
diesel	0
availability	0

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
notice	0
but	0
maybe	0
because	0
i'm	0
not	0
looking	1
for	0
it	0

yeah	0
well	0
i'd	1
bought	1
uh	0
a	0
gmc	1
diesel	0
pickup	1
and	1
uh	0
loved	1
that	1
thing	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
really	1
liked	1
it	0
but	0
it	0
turns	1
out	0
a	0
pickup	1
wasn't	0
what	0
i	0
really	1
needed	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
was	1
the	0
van	1
that	0
i	0
needed	0
then	1
to	0
buying	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
traded	1
it	0
in	0
on	0
the	0
chevy	0
van	1
but	1
uh	0
i	0
sure	1
enjoyed	1
it	0

but	0
you	0
you	0
got	1
the	0
you	1
got	0
the	0
three	1
fifty	0
in	0
the	0
van	1

yeah	1
yeah	0
the	1
three	0
fifty	0
regular	1
gas	0
engine	1

yeah	0
that's	1
what	0
i	0
like	0
because	1
they've	0
got	1
plenty	0
of	0
power	1
and	0
uh	0
if	0
you	0
treat	1
them	0
right	1
they're	0
not	1
the	0
gas	1
guzzlers	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
they've	1
got	1
the	0
reputation	1
to	0
be	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	1
convinced	1
that	0
uh	0
detroit	1
or	0
whoever	1
it	0
is	0
made	1
a	0
major	1
mistake	1
years	1
ago	0
when	1
they	0
stopped	1
putting	1
the	1
small	1
v	1
eights	1
in	0
and	1
went	1
to	0
the	1
fours	1
and	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
sixes	1

yeah	0
well	0

i'm	0
convinced	1
that	0
the	0
small	1
v	0
eight	1
like	0
the	1
the	0
mustang's	1
original	0
two	1
eighty	1
nine	1
or	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
chevy	1
two	0
eighty	0
threes	1
were	0
good	1
little	1
v	1
eight	0
engines	1
that	0
were	0
not	1
gas	0
guzzlers	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
they	0
had	1
enough	0
power	1
to	0
pull	1
all	0
this	0
weight	1

yeah	0

and	0
the	0
four	1
cylinders	0
just	0
don't	0
have	1
it	0

think	1
that	1
little	1
the	0
little	1
chevy	1
v	1
eight	0
when	1
it	0
started	1
out	1
in	0
sixty	0
in	0
fifty	0
five	1
i	0
think	1
was	0
two	1
sixty	0
five	1
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	1

little	0
you	0
know	0
not	0
a	0
hold	0
lot	0
more	0
than	0
the	0
than	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
was	0
like	1
about	0
for	0
about	0
two	1
thirty	0
five	1
or	0
something	0
but	0
uh	0
they	1
kept	0
boring	1
that	0
block	0
out	1
to	0
where	1
you	0
could	0
a	0
get	1
a	0
four	1
hundred	1
small	1
block	0
four	0
hundred	1
that	0
was	1
uh	0
the	0
same	1
block	1
you	0
know	1
just	1
just	0
kept	0
boring	1
it	0
out	1
and	0
boring	1
it	0
out	1
and	0
stroking	1
it	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
yeah	0

i	1
think	0
those	1
g[uys]	0
those	1
little	0
v	1
eights	1
could	1
have	0
been	1
made	1
to	1
be	0
pretty	1
powerful	1
little	0
engines	1
if	0
they	0
would	0
have	1
gone	0
with	1
it	0
but	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
short	1
stroke	0
engine	1
it	0
could	0
really	0
wind	1
up	1

oh	1
yeah	0

the	0
two	1
little	0
cars	1
i've	0
got	0
now	1
bought	1
a	0
mitsubishi	1
mirage	0
here	0
a	0
couple	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
and	0
it	0
was	1
normally	0
carbureted	1
and	0
it's	0
fairly	1
easy	0
to	0
to	0
work	1
with	0
because	0
there's	0
not	1
just	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	1
in	1
it	0
to	0
go	0
wrong	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
changing	0
the	0
plugs	0
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
that's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	1

the	1
the	0
first	1
well	0
my	0
first	0
car	1
was	0
a	0
fifty	0
six	0
mustang	1
and	0
uh	0
over	0
the	0
years	1
uh	0
all	0
i	1
had	1
a	0
uh	0
dodge	1
pickup	1
several	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
uh	1
i	0
can't	0
remember	1
the	0
size	0
of	1
the	0
engine	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
three	0
o	1
seven	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
remember	1
working	1
on	0
those	1
cars	1
you'd	0
open	1
the	0
hood	1
and	0
there	1
was	0
basically	1
nothing	0
in	1
there	0
but	1
an	0
engine	1
and	0
a	0
few	1
things	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

now	1
you	0
open	1
the	0
hood	1
and	0
it's	0
scary	0

yeah	0

like	0
you	0
say	1
it	0
takes	1
a	0
plumber	1
to	0
figure	0
out	1
where	0
all	0
this	0
stuff	0
goes	1

the	0
friend	1
of	0
ours	0
over	0
here	1
he's	0
got	1
uh	0
sixty	0
five	1
or	0
sixty	1
six	0
mustang	1
with	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
look	0
under	0
the	0
hood	1
of	0
that	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
and	1
like	0
you	1
say	0
you	0
can	0
see	1
the	0
road	1

yeah	0

it's	0
amazing	0

well	1
if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
you	0
could	0
climb	1
up	0
in	1
there	0
and	0
do	1
what	0
you	0
needed	1
to	0

you	0
could	1
yeah	1
you	0
could	0
stand	1
in	0
there	0
if	0
you	0
really	0
wanted	1
to	0
i	0
guess	1

my	0
dad's	0
got	0
a	0
new	1
um	0
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
an	0
eighty	1
nine	0
or	0
ninety	1
uh	0
chrysler	1
something	1
or	0
other	0
it's	0
one	0
those	0
transverse	1
mounted	1
v	0
sixes	1
front	1
wheel	0
drive	1

oh	0
yeah	0

and	0
uh	1
he	0
was	0
showing	1
it	0
to	0
me	1
and	0
we're	0
looking	1
under	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
everything's	0
nice	0
and	0
clean	0
and	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
can	0
see	1
the	0
three	1
spark	1
plugs	0
there	0
in	0
the	0
front	1
and	0
i	0
said	0
well	0
where	0
are	0
the	0
other	0
three	0

and	1
he	0
had	1
never	0
really	0
thought	1
about	0

uh	0
i'd	0
say	0
seven	1
or	0
eight	1
of	0
them	0

yeah	0

the	0
last	1
uh	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
first	1
one	0
in	0
a	0
week	1
or	0
so	1

yeah	0
i	0
haven't	1

time	1
the	0
past	0

of	0
times	0
of	0
getting	1
uh	0
answers	1

finding	0
a	0
taker	0

so	0
it	0
sounds	0
it's	1
taken	0

ten	1
fifteen	0
minutes	0
at	0
a	0
time	1
so	1
people	1
or	0
either	0
not	1

first	1
thing	1
uh	1
what	1

think	1
you	1

offer	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
uh	0
information	1
about	1
selecting	1
a	1
school	1

well	1
first	1
i	1
think	1
they've	1
got	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
pretty	1
good	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
do	1

uh-huh	1

uh	1
once	1
they	1
have	0
that	1
then	0
they	1
can	1
start	1
looking	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
publications	1
that	0
give	1
out	1
all	1
the	0
information	1
about	0
schools	1
and	1
write	1
to	0
the	0
schools	0
themselves	1
and	0
start	1
finding	0
out	1
about	0
the	1
different	0
requirements	1
for	0
the	0
programs	1
and	0
what	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	1
of	0
job	1
assistance	1
and	0
all	1
that	0
other	0
kind	1
of	0
stuff	1
they	0
offer	1

yeah	1
uh	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
that	1
the	0
first	1
two	0
years	1
that	1
the	1
um	1
depending	1
upon	0
the	1
field	1
i	1
know	0
there	1
are	1
some	1
fields	0
which	0
a	1
person	1
should	1
go	1
to	0
the	1
school	1
that	1
school	0
all	1
four	1
years	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
fields	0
where	1
it's	0
really	1
not	1
necessary	1

yeah	0
a	0
lot	0
fields	1
are	0
most	1
of	1
your	0
liberal	1
arts	1
degrees	1
and	0
stuff	1
aren't	1
really	1
concerned	1
with	0
your	1
first	0
two	1
years	0
anyway	1
it's	1
it's	0
your	0
core	1
education	1
your	0
general	1
requi[rements]	0
general	0
education	1
requirements	1

uh-huh	1

um	0
if	1
you	0

if	0
they	0
want	1
to	0
get	0
a	0
liberal	0
arts	1
degree	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	1
advice	0
i'd	1
give	0
them	1
go	0
to	1
the	0
school	1
you'd	0
like	0
to	0
go	1
to	0

yeah	1

that's	1
what	0
i	1
did	0

yeah	0

i	0
didn't	1
care	1
about	0
the	0
program	1
or	0
anything	0
else	1
i	0
went	1
where	0
i	0
wanted	1
to	0

i	0
think	1
that	0
i've	1
noticed	1
that	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
friend	1
i	0
think	1
if	0
you're	0
going	1
into	0
like	0
uh	0
law	1
or	1
medicine	1
a	0
very	1
particular	1
very	1
specific	1
field	1
even	1
even	1
engineering	1
you	1
can	0
get	0
you	1
can	0
meet	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
requirements	1
at	0
a	0
public	1
um	1
institution	1

sure	0

and	0
uh	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	0
cheaper	0

oh	1
yeah	1

my	1
parents	1
my	1
parents	0
made	0
a	0
mistake	1
in	1
uh	0
in	0
sending	1
my	0
sister	1
to	1
a	0
private	1
institution	1
for	0
the	0
first	1
two	0
years	1

um	0

and	0
she	1
found	0
out	1
after	1
that	0
she	0
said	1
you	0
know	0
my	0
parents	1
they	1
just	0
they	0
really	1
wasted	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
money	0
this	1
is	0
about	0
twenty	1
years	0
ago	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
uh	0
well	0
right	0
now	0
i	0
just	0
i	0
mean	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
selecting	1
selecting	1
a	0
school	1
i	1
i	0
i	0
feel	1
that	0
uh	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
depends	0
upon	0
the	0
major	1

yeah	0
it	0
does	0
um	0
i	1
didn't	0
know	0
what	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	1
do	1
after	1
i	1
got	0
my	0
my	1
degree	1

uh-huh	0

um	0
originally	1
i	1
had	1
planned	1
uh	0
undergrad	1
degree	1
in	0
political	1
science	1
and	1
then	0
a	0
master's	0
in	0
public	0
administration	1
and	0
i	0
went	1
ahead	0
and	0
pursued	1
that	0
i	1
i	1
got	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	1
thesis	1
and	0
decided	1
to	1
hell	1
with	0
it	1
i	0
didn't	0
want	1
it	0
um	1
and	0
from	1
that	0
point	1
i	0
went	0
to	0
law	1
school	1

um-hum	0

and	0
after	0
a	1
year	0
and	0
a	1
half	1
of	0
that	1
i	0
decided	1
i	0
didn't	0
want	0
that	0
either	1

okay	0

haven't	0
figured	0
out	0
what	1
i	1
want	0
to	0
be	1
when	0
i	0
grow	1
up	0

yeah	0

and	1
so	1
but	0
i	1
i	1
i	0
really	1
did	0
enjoy	0
the	1
law	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	1
that's	1
where	0
i	0
wanted	1
to	1
be	0
but	0
i	1
didn't	1
want	0
to	1
go	0
through	0
the	1
uh	0
the	0
hassle	1
that	0
the	0
law	1
schools	0
put	1
you	1
through	1
because	0
i	0
never	1
did	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
practicing	1
attorney	1
i	0
just	0
wanted	1
a	0
law	1
degree	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
i've	0
since	1
discovered	1
that	0
i	0
would	0
be	0
far	1
better	0
off	0
being	0
in	0
the	0
paralegal	1
field	0
because	1
that's	1
the	0
nuts	1
and	0
bolts	0
of	0
the	0
law	1
and	0
that's	0
what	0
i	0
like	1

yeah	0

and	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
put	1
up	0
with	0
all	0
the	0
b	1
s	0
that	0
the	1
lawyers	1
have	1
to	1

right	0

so	0
that's	1
that's	1
what	0
i'm	0
pursuing	1
right	0
now	1

um	0

and	1
i'm	1
pretty	0
happy	1
with	0
it	0
so	0
far	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
i'm	0
i'm	0
pursuing	0
what	0
they	0
what's	0
what's	0
called	0
an	0
interdisciplinary	0
field	0
i'm	1
a	0
speech	1
therapy	1
major	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
fortunately	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
good	0
medical	1
background	1

yeah	0
that's	1

and	0

that's	1
probably	0
very	0
useful	1

yeah	0
it's	1
it's	0
actually	1
turning	0
out	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
more	1
useful	0
than	0
what	0
i	0
thought	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
also	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
languages	1
background	1
linguistics	1
and	1
some	1
psychology	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
it's	1
all	1
working	0
together	1

yeah	0

the	0
only	1
field	0
i'm	0
not	0
familiar	1
with	0
really	1
is	0
education	1
which	0
is	0
required	1
as	0
well	1
it	0
requires	0
about	0
four	1
or	0
five	0
different	0
fields	1
really	1

oh	0
good	0
grief	0

so	0
it's	0
a	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
i	1
thought	1
at	0
one	1
time	0
i	0
wanted	0
to	1
be	0
a	0
teacher	1
but	0
i	1
i	1
quickly	1
dispelled	1
that	1
idea	0
when	1
i	0
became	1
a	0
substitute	1
teacher	1
for	0
a	1
while	1
just	1
to	1
get	1
my	0
feet	1
wet	1

uh-huh	0

i	1
said	1
uh	1
i	1
couldn't	1
do	0
this	1
everyday	1

no	0
way	0

um	0

maybe	0
maybe	0
being	0
a	0
tenured	0
professor	0
would	0
be	0
one	0
thing	0
but	1
being	0
a	1
public	1
school	1
teacher	0
is	1
entirely	0
another	1
thing	0

oh	1
so	0
you	1
are	1
a	0
disgruntled	1
graduate	1
student	1

i	1
am	0
a	0
dis[gruntled]	1
i	1
am	0
i	1
am	0
just	0
a	0
disgruntled	1
person	1
all	1
around	1

oh	1

i'm	1
the	0
uh	0
i'm	1
the	0
uh	0
original	1
uh	0
mister	0
scrooge	1
i	0
guess	0

yeah	0
bah	1
humbug	0

yeah	0
bah	0
humbug	0
yeah	1
i	0
just	0

i	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
yeah	0
there	1
is	0
i	1
i	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
law	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
fine	1
field	0
a	0
fine	1
profession	1
fine	1
field	0
to	0
go	0
into	1
um	0
i	1
know	1
one	0
time	0
i	1
was	0
in	1
a	0
political	1
science	1
class	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
talking	1
about	0
fields	1
people	1
going	0
into	0
different	0
fields	1
i	1
made	0
an	0
off	1
off	1
the	0
cuff	0
remark	0
about	0
lawyers	1
about	1
uh	0
their	0
integrity	1
being	0
questionable	1
and	0

and	0
i	1
mean	0
oh	1
that	1
was	0
like	0
a	1
can	1
of	0
worms	0

probably	0
you	0
probably	1
got	0
everybody	1
on	1
you	1
because	0
they	1
were	0
probably	0
all	1
going	1
to	0
law	1
school	0

no	1
no	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
woman	0
she	0
said	1
my	1
my	1
best	0
friends	1
are	1
lawyers	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
all	1
this	0
and	1
it	0
was	1
just	1

well	0
that	1
remark	1
in	1
itself	1
is	1
a	0
slam	1
my	1
best	0
friends	1
are	1
lawyers	1

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
it	0

you	1
know	0
like	1
like	1
uh	0
you	0
know	0
my	1
best	0
friends	1

but	0

a	0
friend	1

the	0
program	1
paper	1
chase	0
it's	0
very	1
much	0
like	0
that	1
except	0
worse	1

yeah	0

yeah	0
it's	0
i	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
probably	1
more	1
embarrassing	1
and	0
very	0
painful	1

it	0
is	0

i	0
i	0
see	0
i	0
see	0
that	0
happening	0

yeah	0
very	0
much	0
so	0

yeah	0
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
um	0

yeah	0

it	1
it	1
was	0
enjoyable	1
for	0
a	0
while	1
um	0
but	0
it's	0
such	1
a	0
grind	1

yeah	0

and	0
you	0
begin	0
to	0
wonder	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
if	0
i'm	0
not	0
i	0
mean	0
you	1
really	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
dead	1
set	1
on	0
being	1
a	0
lawyer	1
to	1
do	1
it	0
if	0

uh-huh	0

if	0
you	1
have	0
any	1
doubts	0
whatsoever	1
you	0
better	1
not	0
get	0
into	0
it	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0
i	1
wasted	0
a	1
year	1
and	0
a	1
half	0
of	0
awfully	1
hard	1
and	0
i	1
aged	0
ten	1
years	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
i	0
i	1
i	0
wouldn't	1
trade	0
the	0
experience	1
for	0
anything	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
never	1
hurts	0
to	0
have	1
some	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
grounding	1
in	0
law	1

yeah	0
i	1
i	0
went	1
to	0
a	0
language	1
school	0
and	1
and	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
it	1
was	0
a	0
an	0
i	0
guess	1
uh	0
united	1
states	0
institution	1
it	0
was	0
i	0
was	0
military	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
probably	0
the	0
biggest	0

what	0
branch	0
were	0
you	0
in	0

huh	0

what	0
branch	0
were	0
you	0
in	0

i	1
was	0
in	0
the	0
air	1
force	0

i	0
was	1
too	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
for	0
myself	0
i	0
mean	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
military	0
experience	0
was	0
fine	0
it	0
was	0
just	1
i	0
just	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
was	0
something	0
else	1
that	0
that	1
that	0
i	0
could	1
have	0
done	1
you	0
know	1
with	0

well	0
i	1
got	0
i	1
got	0
tired	1
of	0
the	0
service	0
after	0
a	0
while	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
terrific	1
job	1
really	1
enjoyed	0
it	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
well	0
what	0
was	0
your	0
job	0

uh	0
uh	0
command	0
post	0

uh	1
i	1
was	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
linguist	1

i	0
was	0
just	0
wondering	1
were	0
you	1
in	0
sac	1
by	0
any	0
chance	1

hum	0

were	0
you	0
in	0
sac	0

in	0
tac	0

sac	0

uh	0
no	0
i	0
wasn't	0

oh	0
okay	0
i	1
i	0
thought	1
maybe	0
you	0
might	1
have	0
had	0
some	0
experience	1
with	0
the	1
uh	0
r	0
c	0
one	1
thirty	0
fives	1

no	0
no	0
i	1
didn't	0
i	0
didn't	0
go	0
flight	1
crew	1
matter	1
of	0
fact	0
i	0
didn't	1
make	0
it	0
completely	0
through	1
that	1
through	0
that	0
field	1
i	0
was	0
i	0
was	0
in	0
intelligence	0
school	0
and	0
about	0
three	0
weeks	0
short	0

oh	0

i	1
didn't	0
make	1
[i]t	0
i	0
sort	0
of	0
washed	0
out	0

well	0
that's	0

that's	0

yeah	0
after	1
about	0
eighteen	1
months	0
of	0
talking	1
about	0
the	0
year	1
and	0
a	0
half	0
training	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
it's	0
something	1
you	0
know	0
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
think	1
that's	0
why	1
you	0
know	1
children	0
really	1
need	1
to	1
think	1
about	0
the	0
field	1
they're	0
going	0
to	0
going	0
into	1
and	0
i	0
mean	1
spend	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
serious	1
reading	1
before	1
they	0
i	1
mean	0
not	1
just	0
thinking	1
about	0
they	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

they	0
actually	1
should	1
do	1
some	0
reading	1

that's	0
right	0
and	1
it	1
and	0
if	0
it's	0
possible	1
even	1
get	0
some	0
experience	1
at	0
it	0
or	0
at	0
least	0
watch	1
some	0
people	1
do	1
it	0

and	0
they	0
should	0
study	1
it	1

yeah	0

i	0
i	0
i	1
i	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
to	0
be	0
said	1
for	0
kids	1
working	1
after	0
school	1

uh-huh	0
sure	0

i	0
mean	0
they	0
they	0
find	0
out	0
whether	0
just	0
how	0
much	0
of	0
a	0
people	0
person	0
they	0
are	0

that's	0
true	0
i	1
found	0
that	1
out	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
in	0
high	1
school	0
i	0
worked	0
at	0
mcdonald's	1

oh	0
and	0
i	1
tell	0
you	0
what	1
i	0
worked	1
at	0
mcdonald's	1
as	0
well	1
and	0
i	1
i	1
can	0
tell	1
you	0
one	1
thing	0
there	1
are	0
just	0
some	0
people	1
that	0
i	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
just	0
came	1
to	0
the	0
point	1
where	0
i	0
mean	1
and	1
oh	0
i	0
eventually	1
worked	0
in	0
a	0
lab	1
in	0
a	0
la[b]	0
as	0
a	0
lab	0
technician	1
and	0
i	0
worked	1
front	0
desk	1
and	0
i	0
mean	1
somebody	1
could	0
walk	1
in	0
the	0
door	0
and	0
i	0
knew	0
exactly	1
what	1
they	0
were	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
and	0
say	1

yeah	0
yeah	0
i	0
was	0
the	1
same	0
way	0
too	0
i'm	1
not	1
a	0
people	0
person	0
i	1
i	1
i	0
hate	1
um	0
having	1
to	0
play	1
such	0
a	0
nice	1
guy	0
you	1
know	0
especially	1
when	0
it's	0
all	0
phony	1
especially	1
when	0
you	0
got	1
some	0
uh	0
jerk	1
coming	0
in	0

yeah	0

um-hum	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
it's	1
just	0
not	0
for	0
me	1
i'm	1
uh	0
i	0
deal	1
much	0
better	1
in	0
research	1
and	0
books	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
which	1
is	0
why	1
i'm	0
going	0
to	0
enjoy	0
the	0
paralegal	1
field	0
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0
that's	0
good	0
i	1
was	0
just	0
wondering	1
um	0
getting	1
back	0
to	0
the	0
school	1
thing	0
so	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	0
i	1
almost	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
was	0
some	0

the	1
aids	1
issue	1
is	1
is	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
problem	1
i	1
guess	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
immediate	1
friends	1
with	0
that	1
problem	0
is	1
is	1
the	1
financial	1
end	1
i	1
mean	1
how	1
can	1
a	0
country	1
stand	1
to	1
uh	0
spend	1
as	0
much	1
or	1
much	1
more	1
than	0
they	0
already	1
are	1
on	1
such	0
a	1
problem	1
uh	1
but	0
then	1
that	1
kind	0
of	1
thinking	1
is	0
also	1
tempered	1
with	1
the	1
the	1
knowledge	1
or	0
at	1
least	1
the	0
the	1
rumor	1
i'm	1
not	0
really	1
sure	1
if	0
it's	1
true	1
or	0
not	1
that	1
uh	0
we're	1
not	1
spending	1
as	0
much	1
per	1
let's	0
say	1
afflicted	1
person	1
on	0
cancer	1
uh	1
there's	0
some	1
uh	1
take	1
breast	1
cancer	0
for	1
instance	1
it	0
seems	1
to	0
be	0
doing	0
much	1
more	0
damage	1
and	0
affecting	0
much	1
more	0
peo[ple]	1
mean	1
more	0
people	1
than	0
aids	1
and	0
yet	1
uh	0
more	1
people	0
die	1
of	0
it	0
and	0
yet	0
the	0
funding	1
is	1
already	1
uh	0
exceeded	1
aids	1
has	0
more	0
money	1
than	1
uh	0
breast	1
cancer	1

and	1
well	1
that's	1
interesting	1
isn't	1
it	1
yeah	1

so	1
uh	0
i	1
mean	0
if	1
it's	0
true	1
i	1
i've	1
i've	0
always	1
heard	1
these	0
things	1
i've	1
never	0
bothered	1
to	0
dig	1
it	0
out	0
and	0
make	0
sure	1
but	0
uh	0
i've	0
heard	1
it	0
on	0
more	1
than	0
one	0
documentary	1
that	1
uh	0
they	0
were	0
complaining	1
that	1
whoever's	1
sitting	0
up	0
there	0
making	1
these	0
decisions	1
uh	0
or	0
whatever	0
institutions	1
raise	0
the	0
money	1
and	0
uh	1
it's	0
just	0
one	0
big	1
pr	1
campaign	1
that	0
yeah	0
we	0
think	0
that's	0
the	0
world's	1
worst	0
thing	1
so	0
let's	0
give	0
money	0
to	0
aids	1
and	0
yet	1
we've	0
had	0
breast	1
cancer	0
problems	0
for	0
years	1

right	1

and	1
it's	0
just	0
one	1
of	0
those	0
well	0
of	0
course	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
shows	1
i	0
saw	1
was	0
taking	1
it	0
from	0
the	0
angle	1
that	0
since	0
it	0
doesn't	0
effect	0
men	1
it's	0
not	0
gonna	0
get	0
funded	1
and	1
uh	0
having	0
thought	1
about	0
that	1
for	0
a	0
while	1

what	1
did	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
that	1
idea	0

well	1
i	1
i	0
kind	1
of	1
i	0
thought	1
well	1
that	0
that	1
might	0
be	0
possible	1
since	1
there	0
are	1
a	1
lot	0
of	0
men	1
in	0
control	1
of	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
but	0
then	1
i	0
go[t]	1
i	1
got	0
to	0
thinking	1
the	0
the	0
number	0
one	0
killer	1
of	0
men	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
prostate	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
one	1
test	1
that	0
just	1
recently	1
got	0
developed	1
uh	0
a	0
blood	0
an[tigen]	1
antigen	1
uh	0
antibody	1
test	1
for	0
the	0
antigen	1
in	0
the	0
blood	1
and	0
that's	1
fairly	0
recent	1
and	0
yet	0
men	1
have	0
been	0
dying	0
from	0
prostate	1
cancer	0
for	0
years	1

they've	0
not	1
really	0
given	1
it	0
attention	0
either	1
yeah	1

so	1
it's	1
not	0
really	0
cure	1
f[or]	0
yeah	1
it's	1
not	0
uh	0
not	1
that	0
heavily	0
funded	1
either	1
and	0
that	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
major	1
uh	0
problems	1
that	0
men	1
have	0
in	0
the	0
realm	0
of	0
cancer	1
so	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	0
just	1
some	0
strange	1
public	1
opinion	1
as	0
to	0
who	0
they	1
want	0
to	0
give	1
to	0
um	0
be	1
it	0
through	1
different	1
organizations	1
march	1
of	0
dimes	1
type	1
uh	0
telethons	1
or	0
or	0
bicycle	1
rides	0
or	0
whatever	1
how	1
they	0
fund	1
whatever	1
um	0
illness	1
they	0
wish	1

right	1

it's	0
kind	1
of	0
hard	1
to	0
to	0
get	1
an	0
even	1
keel	1
on	0
that	1
i	0
mean	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	1
to	0
say	1
well	1
there's	1
you	0
know	0
a	0
hundred	0
thousand	1
per	0
year	1
affected	0
by	0
this	1
one	0
so	0
let's	0
give	1
it	0
this	1
amount	1
and	0
then	0
this	0
other	1
one's	0
only	1
a	0
tenth	1
of	1
that	0
so	0
give	1
it	0
a	1
tenth	1
of	0
that	1
and	1
and	0
just	1
keep	1
doling	1
it	1
out	0
that	1
way	1
or	0

well	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
glad	1
i'm	1
not	1
the	1
one	1
that's	1
that's	1
in	0
charge	1
of	0
of	1
making	1
those	0
decisions	1
they	1
uh	0
you	1
wish	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
just	1
be	1
money	1
for	0
all	1
these	1
problems	1
because_1	1
they're	1
all	0
so	1
serious	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
mean	1
it's	0
not	1
so	0
serious	1
i	0
guess	1
until	1
it	0
affects	1
your	1
family	1
and	1
then	0
all	1
the	0
sudden	1
it's	1
the	0
most	1
important	1
thing	1

right	1

so	1
i	0
i	1
would	0
hate	1
to	1
have	0
that	0
responsibility	1
just	0
personally	1
but	1
but	0
then	0
again	1
we	0
really	1
we	0
really	0
do	1
have	0
it	0
as	1
a	1
society	1
just	1
decides	1
which	1
things	0
we	1
need	1
to	0
address	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
it	1
it	1
frightens	1
me	0
to	1
think	1
of	0
so	1
many	0
people	0
with	1
with	1
aids	0
and	0
with	1
cancer	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
those	0
things	0
um	0
if	1
they're	1
not	1
able	1
to	0
to	0
be	0
insured	1
then	0
the	0
country's	1
gonna	0
pay	1
for	1
it	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
the	0
other	1
whether	1
it's	1
through	0
prevention	1
or	0
or	1
treatment	1
or	1
you	1
know	0
just	1
uh	1
just	0
helping	1
the	0
people	1
when	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	0
to	0
take	1
care	0
of	0
themselves	1

right	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
one	1
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
we're	0
gonna	0
end	0
up	0
paying	1
for	0
it	0

that's	0
true	1

just	1

you	0
know	1
the	1
the	0
other	1
thought	1
that	0
i	0
had	1
um	0
i've	0
had	1
several	1
minutes	1
to	0
think	1
about	0
this	0
after	1
i	0
uh	0
while	1
i	0
was	0
finding	1
people	0
i	1
uh	0
i	0
could	0
think	1
about	0
the	0
topic	1
longer	1
than	0
the	0
person	0
that	0
receives	1
it	0
so	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
a	0
unfair	1
advantage	1
as	0
they	0
were	1
but	0

but	0
the	0
other	1
thing	0
that	0
i've	0
thought	1
of	0
on	0
this	1
is	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
there	0
isn't	1
enough	0
money	1
uh	0
in	0
our	0
economy	1
or	0
in	0
our	0
system	1
uh	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
there's	0
so	1
much	1
that	0
goes	1
to	0
things	0
that	0
don't	1
really	1
do	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	0
of	0
good	0
i	0
mean	1
yeah	1
they're	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
but	1
we	0
have	0
such	1
an	0
affluent	1
[s]ociety	1
society	1
that	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
if	0
we	1
took	0
a	0
little	1
from	0
here	1
and	0
there	0
and	0
the	0
other	1
if	0
we	0
might	1
wind	1
up	0
with	0
a	0
uh	0
cure	1
for	0
just	0
about	0
everything	1
of	0

just	1
change	1
our	0
p[riorities]	0

of	0
course	0
then	0
we	0
wouldn't	0
have	0
any	0
room	1
to	0
put	0
people	1
but	1
[laughter-that's]	0

right	1
just	1
change	1
our	0
priorities	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
ridiculous	1
figures	0
for	0
pizza	1
or	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
these	0
phenomenal	1
amount	0
of	0
dollars	1
spent	0
for	0
this	1
that	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
all	1
the	0
arts	1
that	0
that	0
are	0
nice	1
and	0
aesthetic	1
but	0
are	0
they	1
that	1
enhancing	1
for	0
the	1
m[asses]	0
for	0
the	1
masses	1
you	0
know	1
they	0

right	1

they	0
certainly	1
do	0
well	1
for	0
those	0
who	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
symphony	1
orchestra	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
but	0
uh	0
had	0
all	1
that	0
donation	1
and	0
time	1
and	0
labor	1
and	0
effort	1
gone	1
toward	0
something	0
else	1

and	0
then	0
take	1
a	0
can	1

slice	0
white	1
grapes	0

then	1
just	0
bake	1
it	0
and	0
it	1
makes	0
a	0
wonderful	1
sauce	1
over	1
the	0
rice	1

well	1

for	0
my	0
husband	1
because_1	0
it's	0
like	0
hm	0

actually	0
find	1
something	0

that	0
would	0
be	1
kind	0
of	0
sort	1
of	0
elegant	1
kind	1
of	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
you	1
can	0

in	0
having	0
a	0
semi	1
nice	1
dinner	1
or	0

oh	0
yeah	0

or	0
you	1
know	0
semi	1
formal	0
but	1

but	0
then	1
i	0
di[dn't]	0
i	0
hadn't	0
thought	1
about	0
doing	0
it	0
with	0
uncooked	1
rice	0

yeah	0

so	0
just	0
like	0
in	0
a	0
thirteen	1
by	0
nine	0
pan	1

yeah	1
you	0
put	1
in	0
um	0
let's	1

hm	0

let's	1
see	0
what	0
was	1
it	0
three	1
quarters	0
of	0
cup	1
of	0
rice	1
or	0

hm	0

it	0
depends	1
on	0
you	0
can	1
really	0
vary	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

but	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
put	0
the	0
water	1
in	0
proportionally	1
i	0
can't	1
remember	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
was	0
three	1
quarters	0
cup	0
rice	1
to	0
two	1
cups	0
water	1
two	1
cups	0
um	0
broth	0

yeah	1
yeah	1
it's	0
i	1
i	1
use	0
that	0
for	0
brea[kfast]	0
for	0
rice	1
and	0
for	1
when	0
i	0
cook	1
pasta	1
or	0
something	0
i'll	0
i'll	1
put	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
bouillon	1
in	0
there	0
just	0
to	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
little	0
extra	1
flavor	0

yeah	1
that's	1
flavor	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0

hm	0
now	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
good	1

uh-huh	0

how	1
long	0
do	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
bake	1
it	0

um	0
let's	0
see	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
was	0
an	1
hour	1
i've	0
done	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
microwave	1
so	0
often	1
lately	1
because	0
it's	0
it's	0
really	1
easy	1

i	1
do	0
i	1
do	0
microwave	1
too	0
a	0
[laughter-lot]	1

yeah	0
but	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
about	1
an	0
hour	1

how	1
long	0
would	0
it	0
be	1
in	0
the	1
m[icrowave]	0
how	1
long	1
would	0
it	0
be	1
in	0
the	1
microwave	1

or	0
maybe	1
it's	0
only	1
half	1
hour	0

um	0
you	0
just	0
until	1
the	0
rice	1
looks	0
fluffy	1
and	0
and	0
not	0
overdone	1
you	0
know	1
before	1
it	0
gets	0
overdone	1

oh	0
okay	0

okay_1	0

do	0
you	0
just	0
brown	1
the	0
chicken	0
to	0
get	0
it	0
colored	1

yeah	1

or	0
do	0
you	0
go	1
ahead	0
and	0
let	0
it	0
cook	0
through	1

um	0
i'd	1
let	0
it	0
cook	1
just	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
just	0
so	0
that	0
the	0
cooking	1
goes	0
a	0
little	0
faster	1

okay	0

hm	0
oh	0
this	1
is	0
a	0
beneficial	1
call	0
i	1
like	1
this	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
well	0
i	1
liked	0
it	0
your	1
idea	1
too	1
there	0

yeah	0
but	0
that	1
one's	0
an	0
easy	1
one	0
it's	0
like	0
just	0
put	1
in	0
a	0
friend	0
of	1
mine	0
makes	1
it	0
where	0
she	0
goes	1
ahead	0
and	0
seasons	1
up	0
the	0
with	0
the	0
soup	1
and	0
the	0
wine	1

uh-huh	0

put	0
in	0
garlic	1
and	0
onion	1
powder	0
or	1
chopped	0
onions	1
if	0
you	0
wanna	0
do	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
wh[atever]	0
whatever	1
you	0
however	1
much	0
effort	1
you	0
feel	0
like	0
putting	1
into	0
it	0

yeah	0

uh-huh	0

but	1
it	0
it	0
makes	1
a	0
great	1
i	0
mean	0
m[y]	0
i've	1
got	0
a	0
two	1
year	0
old	0
and	0
a	0
four	1
year	0
old	0
and	0
they	1
love	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
be[cause]	0
because	0
my	0
daughter	1
calls	0
it	0
her	1
gravy	1
and	0
i	0
mean	0
she	1
thinks	0
it's	0
wonderful	1
i'm	0

i'm	0
like	0
good	1
you're	0
a	0
picky	0
eater	1
if	0
i	1
can	0
get	0
you	1
to	0
ea[t]	0

well	1
i	1
guess	1
we're	1
uh	1
forced	1
to	1
finally	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
lot	1
about	1
air	1
pollution	1
i	1
hear	1
that	1
the	0
major	1
automobile	1
manufacturers	1
are	1
looking	1
at	1
nonpolluting	1
cars	1
and	1
low	1
polluting	1
f[uels]	0
fuels	1
are	1
being	1
experimented	1
with	1
ethanol	1
and	1
other	1
types	1
of	0
fuels	1

yeah	1
one	1
of	0
the	1
things	1
they	1
asked	1
me	0
to	1
ask	1
you	1
was	1
where	1
you	1
thought	1
the	1
major	1
source	1
was	0
coming	1
from	1
or	1
sources	1

i	1
you	0
know	1
i	0
assume	1
that	0
the	0
major	1
sources	1
are	0
cars	1
and	0
factories	1
but	0

that's	1
what	1
i	0
would	1
think	1

but	0
i	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
for	1
sure	1
i	0

i	0
just	1
know	1
that	1
um	0
acid	1
rain	1
apparently	1
is	1
a	0
big	0
problem	1
in	0
canada	1
from	0
what	0
comes	1
over	0
the	0
border	1
from	0
us	1

right	1
yeah	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
automobile	1
definitely	1
is	1
an	0
area	1
uh	1
any	0
any	1
industry	1
that	1
burns	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
about	1
chemical	1
pollution	1
i'm	1
not	1
real	1
into	1
that	1
as	1
far	0
as	1
how	1
it	0
affects	0
the	1
air	1
i	1
know	0
we	1
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
chemical	1
the	1
indoor	1
type	1
pollution	1
they	1
have	1
offices	1
that	1
are	0
too	1
well	1
insulated	1
they	0
found	1
people	1
are	0
getting	0
sick	1

yeah	1

but	0
i	1
don't	1
know	1
if	1
that	1
affects	0
outside	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
seems	1
to	0
think	1
seems	0
to	0
me	0
that's	1
what	1
they	0
were	1
asking	1
about	1
was	1
outside	1
and	1
the	0
thing	1
i	1
can	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
i	1
can	0
think	1
of	0
would	1
be	0
cars	1
and	0
factories	1

yeah	1
the	1
smokestacks	1
or	1
the	0
exhaust	1
pipes	1

yeah	1

um	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	1
been	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
pressure	1
to	0
um	1
do	0
away	1
with	0
the	0
cfcs	1
in	0
these	0
spray	1
bottles	1
which	0
has	0
been	1
a	0
real	0
problem	1

right	1

yeah	1
that	1
is	1
well	0
that's	1
destroying	1
the	1
ozone	1
isn't	1
it	1

again	1
i	1
that's	1
what	1
i	1
hear	1
and	1
and	1
there's	1
this	1
big	1
debate	1
apparently	1
about	0
whether	1
the	1
ozone	1
there's	1
a	0
hole	1
in	0
the	1
ozone	0
or	1
not	1
but	1
at	0
last	1
i	1
heard	1
it	1
was	1
uh	1
discovered	1
that	0
the	1
hole	1
was	0
bigger	1
than	1
they	0
thought	1
initially	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
that's	1
it	1
it's	1

it's	1
kind	1
of	1
scary	1

well	1
it	0
is	1
scary	0
and	1
i	1
think	1
it	0
will	1
uh	1
continue	1
to	1
force	1
us	0
to	1
clean	1
up	1
our	1
act	1
literally	1
and	0
figuratively	1

yeah	0

we've	0
got	1
to	1
learn	1
to	1
manage	1
without	1
destroying	1
the	1
environment	1

i	0
think	1
something	0
too	1
that	1
you	1
probably	1
see	1
in	1
older	1
states	1
all	0
we	0
we	1
do	1
it	0
down	0
here	1
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
we	0
will	1
have	0
a	0
cold	1
spell	0
is	1
where	1
people	1
will	0
use	1
their	1
fireplaces	1

i	1
i	0
i'm	1
wondering	1
whether	1
it's	1
going	0
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	0
point	1
where	1
you	0
can't	1
do	1
that	1

i	1
think	1
it	0
will	1

in	0
los	0
angeles	1
they're	1
apparently	1
going	1
to	0
they've	1
passed	1
laws	1
that	1
for	1
habit	1
for	0
example	1
people	0
using	1
uh	0
barbecues	1
gasoline	1
lawn	1
mowers	1
um	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
it's	1
really	1
bad	1
in	0
places	1
like	0
los	0
angeles	1
and	0
it's	0
gotten	1
bad	1
in	0
denver	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
and	1
uh	0
it's	0
not	1
too	1
bad	0
around	0
here	1
although	0
you	0
see	1
it	1
you	0
know	1
more	1
and	0
more	1
in	1
the	0
sky	1
and	0
people	1
in	0
this	0
country	1
are	1
really	1
wedded	1
to	1
their	1
uh	1
cars	1
and	1

right	1

and	1
our	1
economy	1
seems	1
to	0
and	0
this	1
i	1
think	1
is	1
one	0
of	1
the	0
big	1
problems	1

yeah	1
in	0
this	1
area	0
too	1
since	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
texas	1
we're	0
so	0
spread	0
out	1
we	0

yeah	1

we	0
have	0
to	0
drive	0
so	0
far	1
but	0
i	0
know	1
in	1
colorado	1
i	1
have	1
witnessed	1
that	1
where	0
it	0
just	1
uh	1
it	0
just	0
stacks	1
up	1
at	0
the	0
when	0
the	0
rockies	1
starts	1
but	0
we're	1
even	0
getting	0
it	0
here	1
we	0
can	0
drive	1
into	0
when	0
we've	0
been	1
on	0
vacation	1
or	0
something	0
drive	1
into	0
fort	1
worth	0
or	0
dallas	1
and	1
you	0
can	0
tell	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
mornings	1
too	1
my	0
husband	1
likes	0
to	0
go	1
out	0
and	0
jog	1
and	0
there's	1
just	1
a	0
brown	1
fog	1
here	0
and	0
we	1
don't	0
even	0
have	1
any	0
mountains	1
that	0
are	0
holding	1
it	0
in	0

yeah	1

but	1
they	0
also	1
said	0
that	0
more	1
dense	1
the	0
population	1
and	0
the	0
more	1
we	0
crowd	1
together	1
the	0
worse	1
it	0
gets	1

well	0
that	1
makes	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
sense	1
i	0
mean	1
i	0
i	1
hadn't	0
thought	1
about	0
it	0
that	1
way	0
but	0
it	0
it	1

you	0
don't	1
have	0
to	0
have	0
mountains	1
there	0
stopping	1
it	0

yeah	1

and	1
uh	1
they	0
make	0
uh	1
making	1
more	0
and	0
more	0
high-rise	1
buildings	1
and	0
uh	0
so	0
yeah	1
we	0
can	0
comment	1
and	0
we	1
didn't	0
see	1
this	0
a	0
few	0
years	1
ago	0

no	1
and	0
i	0
think	1

it	0
was	0
pretty	0
clear	1
here	0

yeah	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
that	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
it's	0
becoming	0
apparent	1
to	1
people	0
that	0
the	0
earth	1
which	0
includes	0
all	1
the	0
people	1
on	1
it	0
and	0
everything	0
that's	0
going	0
on	1
it	0
is	0
a	0
is	0
an	0
organism	1
of	0
sorts	1
and	0
that	0
there	1
is	0
a	0
uh	0
a	0
whole	1
set	1
of	0
organic	1
relationships	1
that	0
if	0
we	0
start	1
to	0
destroy	1
one	0
part	1
of	0
it	0
it's	0
going	1
to	0
tell	1
us	0
about	0
it	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
uh	0
we're	1
going	0
to	1
feel	1
it	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	1
going	1
to	0
be	1
real	1
interesting	1
and	1
particularly	1
in	1
light	1
of	0
what	0
is	0
obviously	1
going	0
to	1
be	1
a	0
big	0
structural	1
change	0
in	0
the	0
economy	1
uh	1
in	1
this	0
country	1
uh	0
whether	0
people	1
are	1
willing	0
to	1
get	0
out	0
of	1
their	0
cars	1
and	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

and	1
i[n]	1
in	0
this	0
country	1
uh	0
the	0
the	0
solution	1
that	0
that	0
people	1
seem	0
to	1
think	0
work	1
are	0
politically	0
unacceptable	1
for	0
example	1
taxing	1
people	0
heavily	1
for	0
using	1
their	0
cars	1

yeah	1

and	0
uh	1
i'm	0
i	1
have	1
a	0
little	0
sports	1
car	0
that	0
i	1
enjoy	0
using	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
just	1
like	0
anybody	0
else	1
how	0
much	0
fun	1
it	0
is	0
to	1
drive	1
but	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
we're	0
gonna	0
have	1
to	0
make	0
some	0
fundamental	1
changes	1
and	0
and	0
i'm	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
how	0
long	1
it's	0
gonna	0
take	1
or	0
what	1
it's	0
gonna	0
take	0
because	0
they	0
keep	0
saying	1
that	0
the	0
economy	1
is	0
gonna	0
depend	1
on	0
how	1
many	0
cars	1
and	0
houses	1
we	0
sell	1

yes	1

and	0
it's	0
a	0
shame	1
too	1
when	0
you	0
do	1
see	0
somebody	1
driving	1
a	0
big	1
car	1
just	0
one	1
person	1
in	0
that	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
waste	1
but	0

so	1
well	1
you['re]	1
you['re]	1
you're	1
you	1
you	1
take	1
this	1
subject	1
much	1
more	1
personally	1
than	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
suppose	1

i	1
suppose	1
i	1
do	1
because	1
i've	1
seen	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
those	1
changes	1
the	1
the	1
changes	1
that	1
women	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
genera[tion]	1
well	1
you	1
know	0
not	1
even	0
the	1
last	1
generation	1
the	1
last	1
fifteen	1
years	1
twenty	1
years	0
going	0
from	1

uh-huh	1

well	1
take	1
it	0
back	1
thirty	1
years	1
i'm	1
going	1
back	1
too	1
far	1
from	1
my	1
parents'	1
generation	1
when	1
mom	1
stayed	1
home	1
period	1
an[d]	1

yeah	1

and	0
there	1
was	1
no	0
such	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
job	1
or	1
any	0
hope	1
of	1
a	0
job	1
until	1
well	1
unless	1
if	1
you	1
were	0
educated	1
you	1
got	1
you	1
know	1
you	0
might	1
teach	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
before	1
you	0
got	1
married	1

yeah	1

and	1
if	1
you	0
really	1
pushed	1
it	1
you	1
taught	1
until	1
you	1
had	0
kids	1
or	0
something	1
you	0
know	1
if	1

yeah	1

if	1
you	1
had	1
if	0
you	1
were	0
a	1
teacher	1
then	0
you	1
know	0
that	1
was	1
it	1
until	0
the	1
kids	1
you	1
were	0
little	1

yeah	1
you	1
you	1
weren't	1
supposed	0
to	1
want	1
a	0
job	1

yes	1
there	1
was	0
not	1
there's	0
not	1
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
any	1
reason	1
to	1
use	1
this	1
education	1
or	1
this	1
brain	1
that	1
you	0
might	1
have	1
for	1
anything	1
other	1
than	0
your	1
house	1
and	0
your	1
children	1
and	0
how	1
clean	1
can	1
the	0
the	0
bathroom	1
floors	0
be	1
on	0
any	0
given	1
day	0

yeah	1

and	0
then	1
and	1
then	1
of	0
course	0
today	1
it's	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
all	0
the	1
other	1
way	1
you're	0
supposed	1
to	0
only	1
want	0
the	0
job	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
your	1
kids	1
should	0
be	0
totally	1
happy	0
in	1
day	1
care	1
because	0
everybody	0
else	1
goes	0
to	0
day	0
care	1

yeah	1

and	0
and	1
we	0
have	1
these	0
wonderful	1
people	0
who	1
are	1
who	1
are	0
totally	1
prepared	1
to	0
tea[ch]	0
to	0
teach	1
your	1
child	1
everything	1
they	1
need	0
to	0
know	0
in	0
day	1
care	0
and	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1
but	0
but	0
but	0
uh	0
a	0
really	1
good	0
day	1
care	0
is	0
probably	0
going	0
to	0
cost	1
more	0
than	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
make	0
at	0
the	0
job	1

and	0
and	0
uh	1
we'll	0
see	1
how	1
the	1
generations	0
go	1
huh	0

yeah	1
i	0
at	1
least	1
for	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	1
depending	1
on	1
on	0
what	0
she	1
did	1
i've	1

yeah	1

i've	1
i	1
was	0
an	1
engineer	1
with	0
uh	1
mechanical	1
engineer	0
with	0
t	0
i	1
and	1
uh	0
i	1
did	0
it	0
for	0
six	1
years	1
and	1
for	0
one	1
well	0
i	0
had	1
one	1
while	0
i	0
was	0
pregnant	1
and	0
then	0
one	1
while	0
my	1
oldest	1
was	0
a	0
year	1
old	1
and	0
and	1
it	0
just	0
drove	1
me	0
crazy	1

did	0
you	0

i	1
could	0
not	0
do	1
either	1
well	1
enou[gh]	0
i	1
couldn't	0
put	0
in	0
enough	1
overtime	0
that	0
was	0
necess[ary]	1
or	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
things	1
that	0
would	0
come	1
up	0
at	0
work	1
that	0
would	1
require	1
me	0
to	0
stay	0
late	1
or	1
to	1
come	0
in	0
early	1
or	0
to	0
do	0
something	0
on	0
saturdays	1
as	1
is	0
you	1
know	0
as	1
is	1
needed	1
and	1
because	1
my	0
husband	1
had	0
had	0
for	1
a	0
long	1
time	1
was	1
out	1
of	0
the	0
country	1
also	1
with	0
uh	0
with	0
work	1
for	0
like	0
three	1
months	0
and	0

um-hum	0

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
and	0

so	0
it	0
was	0
you	1
and	0
the	0
kid	1
and	0
your	0
work	1
schedule	1
is	0

yeah	1

well	0
that's	1
the	0
thing	0
see	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	1
if	0
you	0
get	0
along	0
for	0
example	0
if	0
you'd	1
been	0
a	0
technician	1
instead	1
of	1
an	0
engineer	1
you	0
know	0
the	1
technicians	1
work	0
the	1
eight	0
to	1
five	1
job	1
and	1
and	0
know	1
when	1
they're	1
going	1
to	0
be	1
there	0

yeah	1
it	0
might	1
have	0
been	1
better	1

yeah	1

but	1
uh	0
if	1
you're	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
pro[fessional]	1
professional	1
oriented	1
then	0
you've	0
got	1
to	0
have	0
this	1
to	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
perform	1
well	0
on	1
the	0
job	1
you've	0
got	1
to	1
have	0
the	1
flexibility	1
that	1
that	0
doesn't	1
really	0
go	1
with	0
the	0
family	1

yeah	1
and	1
so	0
it	1
was	0
in	0
my	1
case	1
i	1
i	0
just	0
uh	0
decided	1
that	0
as	0
long	1
as	1
my	0
kids	1
were	0
little	1
i	1
would	0
be	0
better	0
off	1
at	0
home	0
with	0
them	1
instead	0
of	1
driving	1
myself	0
crazy	1
trying	0
to	0
do	1
everything	1
at	0
once	1

um-hum	0
so	1
you	0
figure	1
one	1
of	0
these	1
days	1

well	1
actually	0
i've	1
found	0
out	0
that	0
i'm	1
not	1
going	0
to	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
being	1
an	0
engineer	1

you're	0
going	1
to	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
being	0
an	0
engineer	1
is	0
that	1
what	0
you	0
think	1

i'm	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
a	0
photographer	1
now	0

oh	1
okay	0
you've	0
found	1
something	0
else	1

i	0
have	1
i	0
have	0
branched	1
out	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
photographer	1
before	1
but	0
when	0
i	1
went	0
to	0
college	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
felt	0
like	0
i	1
couldn't	0
support	0
myself	1
if	0
i	0
decided	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
photographer	1
that	0
it	0
would	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
hobby	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
very	0
mechanical	1
and	0
mechanical	0
engineering	1
interested	0
me	0
so	0
i	0
did	0
that	1
and	0
then	0
i	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
did	1
that	0
for	0
six	1
years	0
and	1
then	0
i	0
stayed	0
home	1
with	0
my	0
son	1
and	0
did	0
nothing	1
and	0
found	1
out	0
that	0
i	0
was	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
great	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
i	1
was	0
bored	1
part	1
of	0
the	0
time	0
too	1
and	0
i	0
wanted	0
something	1
else	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	0
i	1
mean	0
you	0
figure	1
there's	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
more	0
to	1
life	1
than	0
sitting	1
here	0
playing	1
with	0
this	1
child	1

yeah	0
and	0
it['s]	1
it's	1
great	1
while	1
they're	0
really	0
little	1
but	0
as	1
they	0
get	0
older	1
and	1
they're	1
more	1
independent	1

things	1

then	1
it's	1
good	0
for	0
them	1
to	0
go	1
to	1
different	1

um-hum	1

i	0

a	0
a	0
mother's	1
day	0

a	1
week	1
both	1
of	0
my	0
kids	1

and	1
so	0
they're	1
getting	1
they	1

socialization	1
with	0
other	0
kids	1
and	0
y[ou]	0
you	1
know	0
and	0
not	1
really	0
school	1
but	1
but	1
a	0
different	1
authority	0
than	0

once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
kind	0
of	0
learning	0
how	1
to	0
deal	0
with	0
society	1

and	1
and	0
they	1
they	0
need	1
that	1
you	0
know	1
to	0
be	0
able	1
to	1
relate	1
to	0
other	0
people	1
besides	1
the	0
same	1
person	1
every	0
day	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
they	0
do	1
too	0

and	0
i	1
need	0
it	0
for	0
the	0
break	1

yeah	1
well	0
that's	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
you	0
know	0
they	0
talk	0
about	0
women	1
leaving	1
the	0
home	1
and	0
going	0
out	0
to	0
work	1
well	1
still	1
taking	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
children	1
is	1
a	0
very	1
important	1
job	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1
and	0
someone's	1
got	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
and	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
do	0
it	0
right	1
and	1
and	1
if	0
it's	0
not	1
if	1
it's	0
not	0
mom	1
then	1
then	0
dad	1
or	1
somebody's	1
got	0
to	1
move	1
in	0
there	1
and	0
do	1
the	0
job	1
because	1
the	1
kids	1
really	0
need	1
it	0

and	0
enjoy	1
it	0
that's	1
that's	1
the	0
whole	1
thing	0

yeah	1

i	1
think	0
that's	1
the	0
thing	1
that	1
were	0
going	0
to	0
see	1
well	0
i	1
think	0
the	0
biggest	1
thing	0
we're	0
going	0
to	0
see	0
coming	1
up	0
in	0
the	0
next	1
ten	1
year[s]	0
even	1
in	0
the	0
even	1
now	1
they're	0
starting	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
in	0
the	0
next	0
ten	1
to	0
fifteen	0
years	1
is	0
that	0
there's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	1
and	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
work	1
it	0
out	1
to	0
working	1
part	0
time	1

um-hum	0

because	0
if	0
if	1
i	0
if	0
i	0
had	1
been	0
allowed	0
to	0
work	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	0
thirty	1
hours	0
a	0
week	0
instead	1
of	0
fifty	1
hours	0
a	0
week	1
i	0
might	1
still	0
be	0
working	1
basically	1
full	1
time	0
or	0
part	1
time	0
if	0
there	1
was	0
if	0
there	1
had	0
been	0
some	0
way	0
to	0
work	1
it	0
out	1
because	1

yeah	1

because	1
i	0
liked	1
my	0
job	1
really	0
well	1

um-hum	0

but	0
i	1
was	0
just	0
pulled	1
in	0
so	1
many	0
different	0
directions	1
i	1
was	1
it	0
was	0
just	0
driving	0
me	1
crazy	1
and	0
now	1
with	0
the	0
photography	1
that's	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
working	1
that's	0
what	0
i'm	0
doing	1
is	0
working	0
part	1
time	1
because	0
i	0
can	0
put	1
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
situation	1
for	1
a	0
few	0
hours	1
in	0
the	0
uh	0
week	1
and	0
and	1
use	1
those	0
hours	1
to	0
do	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
thing	1
that	0
i'm	0
doing	0
is	1
taking	1
school	0
pictures	1
in	1
day	1
cares	1
and	0
in	1
mother's	0
day	0
out	1
programs	1
and	0
also	1
soccer	1
teams	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
different	1
stuff	1
like	0
that	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

um-hum	0

so	1
my	0
kids	1
can	0
be	1
in	0
day	1
care	1
for	0
a	0
few	1
hours	1
a	1
week	1
or	0
my	0
husband	1
if	0
it's	0
you	1
know	1
an[d]	0
an[d]	1
when	1
he's	0
at	0
home	1
can	0
take	1
care	1
of	0
them	0

yeah	0
so	0
jobs	1
have	0
to	0
i	0
guess	0
become	1
more	0
flexible	1

i	0
think	1
they're	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
and	0
not	1
and	0
not	0
just	0
for	0
mothers	1
for	0
fathers	1
as	0
well	1

yeah	1

it's	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
both	1

well	0
so	0
so	1
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
that	0
has	0
to	0
adapt	1
is	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
the	1
the	0
father's	1
attitudes	1
about	0
you	0
know	0
who[se]	1
whose	1
job	1
is	1
this	0

yeah	1

well	1
it['s]	0
it's	0
his	1
job	0
too	0
and	0
i	1
to	0
me	1
the	0
only	0
important	1
issue	1
is	0
the	0
children	1
because	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
housework	1
goes	1
you	0
know	1
men	1
can	0
do	0
housework	1
just	0
as	0
easily	1
as	0
women	1
and	0
thanks	1
to	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
new	0
inventions	1
housework	1
doesn't	0
take	0
as	1
much	1
time	1
as	0
it	0
used	1
to	0
so	1
uh	0

it's	0
just	0
convincing	1
your	0
husband	1
that's	1
important	1
or	0
that	1
that	1
that	0
it's	1
important	1
enough	0
for	1
him	0
to	1
do	1
it	0

yeah	1
to	0
yeah	1
to	0
m[e]	0

yeah	1
well	1

because	1
if	0
he	0
saw	1
mom	1
doing	1
only	1
that	1
you	0
know	0
all	1
the	0
time	0
he	1
was	0
growing	0
up	1
then	0
it's	0
hard	1
to	0
think	0
of	0
it	1
in	0
that	0
other	1
you	0
know	0
uh	1
that	0
i	1
should	0
do	1
it	0
or	0
tha[t]	1
or	0
just	0
to	0
think	1
about	1
doing	1
it	0
rather	1
than	0
having	1
someone	1
tell	1
him	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

and	0
you	1
you	0
you	1

yeah	1
you	0
talk	1
yeah	1

yeah	1

i	0
know	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
big	0
thing	1
in	0
our	0
house	1
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
was	0
that	1
if	0
i	0
wanted	1
my	0
husband	0
to	0
do	0
something	1
to	0
help	1
and	0
even	0
though	1
we	0
were	0
both	1
working	0
the	0
same	1
number	0
of	0
hours	1
and	0
and	0
doing	0
things	0
i	1
had	0
to	0
come	0
in	0
there	0
specifically	1
and	0
say	1
this	1
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
this	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

this	0
is	0
what	1
you	0
do	1
it	0
now	1
[laughter-no]	1

and	0
a	0
man	1
might	0
say	1
out	0
loud	1
well	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
understand	1
this	1
and	0
i	0
agree	1
but	0
still	1
he	0
was	0
raised	1
with	0
a	0
mom	1
taking	0
care	1
of	0
him	0
and	0

yes	1
and	1

and	0
and	0
that's	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
attitude	0
to	0
change	1

yeah	0
and	1
without	1
and	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
they	0
don't	0
look	1
at	0
things	1
most	1
men	0
don't	0
walk	1
into	0
the	0
kitchen	1
and	0
see	0
that	0
the	0
dishes	1
are	0
there	1
and	0
that	0
yes	1
you	0
probably	0
ought	0
to	0
unload	1
the	0
dishwasher	1
and	0
load	1
the	0
new	0
ones	0
in	1
and	0
run	1
it	0

um-hum	0

they	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
kind	0
of	0
scoot	1
it	0
on	0
another	0
spot	1
on	1
the	0
on	0
the	0
sink	1
and	1
and	0
put	0
the	0
next	0
plate	1
down	1
and	1
and	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
get	0
around	1
to	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
most	0
women	0
walk	1
in	0
and	0
and	0
and	1
with	0
oh	0
got	0
to	0
clean	1
all	0
this	0
up	1
got	0
to	0
get	1
this	1
out	1
and	0
this	0
in	1
and	0
this	1
you	1
know	0
taken	0
care	1
of	0
instead	1
of	0
having	0
someone	0
say	1
now	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
do[ne]	1
this	1
is	0
the	0
time	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
but	0

hm	0
uh	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1

and	0

but	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
is	0
is	1
how	1
it	0
was	0
drilled	1
into	0
you	0
when	0
you	0
were	0
a	0
kid	1
which	0
brings	0
us	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
idea	1
you	0
know	0
someone's	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
there	0
taking	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
kids	1
to	0
drill	1
in	0
these	1
you	0
know	0
drill	1
in	0
the	0
right	1
ideas	0
to	0
so	0
that	0
they	0
know	1
that	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
male	1
and	0
female	1
are	0
both	0
responsible	0
for	0
doing	1
this	0
and	0

that's	0
right	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

and	0
and	1
uh	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	1
going	0
to	0
show	1
up	0
a	0
lot	1
more	1
now	0
in	0
the	1
in	1
the	0
next	0
generation	0
of	1
of	0
boys	1
and	0
girls	1
it's	0
not	1
they're	1
not	0
going	1
to	0
the	0
boys	1
in	0
this	0
next	1
generation	0
are	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
told	1
as	0
much	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
because	0
mom	1
was	0
there	1
saying	0
that	0
dad	1
is	0
there	1
you	0
know	0
you	0

uh-huh	0


you	0
both	1
got	1
to	0
they	1
were	0
both	1
working	0
at	0
whatever	0
things	1
were	0
needed	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
they're	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

they're	1
going	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
the	0
kids	1
you	1
need	0
do	0
this	1
because	1
it	0
needs	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
not	0
because	1
it's	0
a	0
woman's	1
job	1
or	0
a	0
man's	1
job	0
but	0
because	1
it's	0
dirty	1
and	0
it	0
needs	1
to	0
be	0
cleaned	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
in	0
between	1
we	0
got	1
a	0
a	0
group	1
of	0
kids	0
a	0
generation	1
of	0
kids	0
who	1
didn't	1
learn	0
to	0
take	0
responsibility	1
because	1
mom	1
left	0
to	0
go	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
and	0
dad	1
didn't	0
move	1
in	0
to	0
fill	0
the	0
gap	1
and	0
so	0
basically	1
no	1
one	0
was	0
taking	0
the	0
responsibility	1

and	0
it's	0
gonna	1
it's	0
gonna	1
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
happened	1
in	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
cases	1

yeah	1
some	0
kids	0
are	0
really	1
having	0
it	0
if	0
they'd	0
been	1
in	0
day	0
care	0
the	0
entire	1
time	1
and	0
it	0
wasn't	1
yeah	1
the	0
ones	1
that	0
are	0
now	0
getting	1
to	0
be	0
teenagers	1
and	0
in	0
some	0
cases	1
young	0
college	1

um-hum	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
some	1
time	0
day	1
care	0
is	0
really	0
good	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
sometimes	1
it's	0
just	1
it's	0
baby	1
sitting	0

yeah	1

it's	0
someone	1
you	0
know	0
keeping	0
an	0
eye	1
on	0
the	0
kids	1
but	0
the	0
kids	0
are	0
basically	1
doing	0
what	0
they	0
want	1
and	0
not	1
really	1
having	0
any	1
relationship	1
with	0
the	0
adults	1
to	0
say	0
you	0
know	0
here's	1
what's	0
right	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
here's	1
what's	0
wrong	1
and	0
and	0
here's	1
what	0
we	0
expect	1
of	0
you	0

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
that	1
was	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
main	0
reasons	1
that	0
i	0
quit	1
was	0
because	0
i	0
wanted	1
my	1
kids	0
to	0
have	0
my	1
values	0
and	0
i	0
felt	1
like	0
when	0
they	0
were	0
young	1
that	0
was	1
the	0
time	1
to	0
instill	1
it	0
that	0
it	1
could	0
be	1
it	0
could	0
be	0
added	1
to	0
and	0
strengthened	1
as	0
they	0
grew	0
older	1
but	0
when	1
they	0
were	0
little	1
you	0
know	0
this	1

yeah	1

this	1
is	0
the	0
way	0
i	1
feel	0
about	1
this	0
and	0
this	1
is	0
the	0
way	1
because_1	1
i	0
it's	0
you	1
know	0
when	1
you	0
when	0
you	0
if	0
you	1
if	0
you	0
teach	1
them	0
when	0
they're	0
little	1
the	0
way	1
you	0
want	1
them	0
to	0
be	1
and	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
are	0
important	0
to	0
you	1
then	0
you	0
just	1
you	0
add	1
onto	0
it	0
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

um-hum	0

but	0
if	0
no	1
one	0
does	0
anything	1
when	0
they're	0
little	1
then	0
it's	0
twice	1
as	0
hard	1
as	0
i	0
think	1
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

yeah	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
saying	1
this	0
as	0
i'm	0
trying	1
to	0
keep	0
my	0
nine	0
month	0
old	1
from	0
trashing	1
something	0

yes	1
i	0
understand	1
i	1
i	0
wait	1
until	0
i	0
put	0
mine	0
in	0
bed	1
before	0
i	0
make	0
my	0
calls	1

yeah	0
well	0
she's	1
usually	1
in	0
bed	0
by	0
this	0
time	0
but	0
she's	0
staying	1
up	0
late	1
tonight	0
but	0
yeah	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
relationship	0
with	0
her	1
you	0
know	0
m[y]	1
my	1
dad	0
was	0
a	0
very	0
traditional	0
dad	1
and	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
child	1
i	1
didn't	0
really	0
know	1
my	0
dad	0
very	0
well	0
and	0
i	0
miss	1
that	0
and	0
i	1
want	1

that's	1
the	0
thing	1
if	0
woman's	0
role	1
like	0
we	0
said	0
if	0
women's	1
roles	1
change	0
drastically	1
men's	1
roles	0
will	0
too	1

yeah	0
the	0
men	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
convinced	1
of	0
that	1

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it's	0
for	0
the	0
better	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
women's	1
roles	0
i	0
think	0
are	0
almost	1
for	0
the	0
worse	1
because	0
we're	1
losing	1
out	0
on	0
some	0
things	1
going	0
back	0
to	0
work	1
but	1
i	0
think	1

desert	1
animal	0
because_1	0
he's	0

but	0
he's	0
a	0
very	1
tame	1
spoiled	1
house	1

when	0
he	0
was	0
younger	1
i	0

then	0

sure	1

and	0
older	1

yeah	1

well	0
we	1
went	1
to	0
a	1
uh	0
cat	1
show	1
at	1
the	0
plano	1
center	1
here	0
in	0
town	1
and	0
uh	1
we	1
thought	1
that	1
we	1
have	0
a	1
cat	1
now	1
but	1
we	1
thought	0
well	1
if	0
we	1
ever	1
get	1
another	1
cat	1
you	1
know	1
we'd	1
want	0
something	1
kind	1
of	1
unique	1
so	1
we	1
kind	1
of	1
looked	0
around	1
and	0
they	1
had	0
everything	1
from	1
hairless	1
cats	1
to	1
siamese	1
cats	1
and	1
persian	1
cats	1
and	0
we	1
sort	1
of	0
fell	1
in	0
love	1
with	1
the	0
uh	1
maine	1
coon	1
cats	0

oh	1
i've	0
seen	1
them	0
i	0

they're	1
huge	1

yeah	1
i	0
have	1
seen	0
them	1
they	1
um	0
weren't	1

actually	1
i	0
can't	1
remember	1
they	0
were	0
used	1
to	0
be	0
used	1
on	0
ships	1
and	1
in	0
for	0
for	0
mousers	1
you	0
know	1
so	0

very	1
nautical	1

be	1
darned	1
i	0
didn't	1
know	0
that	1

yeah	1
i	0
just	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
i'm	0
i	0
think	1
i'm	0
being	0
accurate	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
area	1
of	0
folklore	1
but	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	1

we[ll]	1
that's	1
interesting	1

yeah	1

we	1
kind	1
of	1
like	0
well	1
my	1
family	1
didn't	1
necessarily	0
like	0
like	1
them	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
i	1
did	0
but	0
the	0
manx	1
is	1
that	1
the	0
one	0
that	0
doesn't	0
have	0
a	0
tail	1
it	0

yeah	1

it	0
sort	0
of	0
has	0
a	1
bob	1
tail	0
i	1
kind	0
of	1
like	1
that	0
too	1
but	1

yeah	1
i'd	0
love	1
to	0
go	0
to	1
a	1
cat	0
show	1
i'm	1
real	1
li[ke]	0
a	0
real	1
cat	0
lover	1
i'd	0
i'd	0
have	1
a	0
lot	1
more	0
cats	1
if	0
my	0
boyfriend	1
would	0
let	1
u[s]	1
let	1
me	0

he	1
doesn't	1
really	1
like	1
mine	1
let	1
alone	0
another	1
one	0

well	1
i'll	0
tell	1
you	0
an	0
interesting	0
story	1
about	0
how	1
i	0
got	0
my	0
dog	1
and	0
then	0
i	0
suppose	1
our	0
five	1
minutes	0
will	1
be	0
up	1
huh	1

yeah	1
okay	1

i	0
uh	1
work	1
for	0
a	1
university	1
and	0
i	1
went	1
to	0
uh	1
omaha	1
nebraska	1
to	1
recruit	0
students	1
and	0
i	1
had	1
some	1
time	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
a	0
a	0
pet	1
shop	1
and	0
i	0
saw	1
these	0
little	1
springer	0
spaniels	1

hm	0

and	1
so	0
i	0
decided	1
well	1
you	0
know	1
this	1
would	0
really	0
be	0
a	0
nice	1
dog	0
to	0
have	1
so	1
when	0
i	0
got	1
back	0
home	1
to	1
carney	1
nebraska	1
i	0
told	1
my	0
wife	1
about	0
it	0
and	1
i	0
said	1
you	0
know	1
this	1
is	0
just	0
a	0
i	0
i	0
can	0
just	0
hear	1
the	0
dog	0
crying	1
for	0
me	0
now	1

i	0
know	1
what	0
you	0
mean	1

and	0
and	0
christmas	1
is	0
coming	1
up	0
you	0
know	1
hint	1
hint	1
and	0
so	0
i	1
had	0
to	0
go	0
back	1
the	1
next	1
week	0
as	0
well	1
as	1
a	0
bunch	0
of	1
other	1
people	0
from	1
the	0
university	1
and	0
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
uh	1
that	0
we	1
went	1
with	1
uh	0
they	1
were	0
friends	1
of	1
ours	0
and	0
so	1
we	1
uh	0
got	1
to	0
omaha	1
and	0
i	0
decided	1
i'd	0
take	0
my	0
friend	1
over	0
and	0
show	1
him	0
the	0
dog	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
got	0
over	1
there	0
and	0
she	0
said	0
oh	1
that's	0
too	0
bad	1
the	0
dog	1
has	0
already	1
been	0
sold	1
and	0
i	0
didn't	0
realize	1
it	0
but	0
this	0
guy	1
had	0
somehow	1
worked	0
it	0
out	1
so	0
that	0
he	1
got	0
there	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
earlier	1
bought	1
the	0
dog	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
in	0
the	0
back	0
room	1
and	0
uh	0
so	0
that	0
night	1
we	0
had	0
a	0
reception	1
for	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
uh	0
potential	1
high	1
school	0
students	0
or	0
college	1
students	0
and	0
and	1
uh	0
he	1
had	0
the	0
dog	1
the	0
whole	0
time	1
in	0
his	0
room	1
and	0
and	0
i	1
had	0
no	0
idea	1
and	0
so	1
we	0
headed	1
back	0
to	0
carney	1
that	0
night	0
and	0
the	0
dog	0
rode	1
in	0
the	0
car	1
and	0
we	0
stopped	1
along	0
the	0
way	1
and	0
had	0
a	0
bite	0
to	0
eat	1
and	0
they	0
left	1
the	0
dog	0
in	0
the	0
car	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
while	0
we	0
were	0
inside	0
eating	1
thumper	1
just	0
tore	0
the	0
heck	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
inside	0
of	0
the	0
car	1
and	0
uh	0
finally	1
we	0
made	0
it	0
back	1
to	1
uh	0
to	0
carney	1
and	0

okay	1

[ok]ay	1
um	1
so	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
um	1
about	1
putting	1
an	1
elderly	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
it	1
varies	1
on	1
on	1
the	1
individual	1
basis	1

hm	1

uh	1
sometimes	1
it	1
is	1
there's	1
no	1
alternative	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
have	1
uh	0
uh	0
family	1
available	1
or	0
family	1
that's	0
uh	1
you	1
may	1
not	0
even	0
have	0
family	1
that	1
is	1
uh	0
in	1
and	0
who	1
around	1

that's	1
true	1
yeah	1

so	1
sometimes	1
it's	0
not	0
an	1
alternative	1

hm	0

and	1
i	1
think	1
uh	1
but	1
i	1
think	1
also	1
sometimes	1
it	1
can	0
be	1
uh	1
a	1
benefit	1
if	1
it's	1
for	1
a	1
short	0
time	1
sometimes	1
in	0
a	1
nursing	1
home	0

um-hum	0

um	1
especially	1
after	1
if	1
it's	0
after	1
an	1
acute	0
illness	1
to	1
get	0
over	1
a	0
uh	0
or	1
to	0
rehab	1
after	1
uh	0
an	0
illness	1

that's	1
true	1
i	0
never	0
thought	1
of	0
that	0
yeah	0

sometimes	1
you	1
know	1
it	0
sometimes	1
the	0
nursing	1
homes	0
are	0
good	1
for	0
uh	0
just	0
short	1
periods	1
of	0
time	1

that's	0
true	1
until	1
they	0
get	0
over	0
that	0
hump	1
of	0
whatever	1
it	1
is	0
they're	1
dealing	1
with	0

um-hum	1

because	1
too	1
often	1
the	1
acute	1
hospitals	1
will	0
are	1
sending	1
them_1	1
out	1
much	1
faster	1
than	1
what	1
they're	0
really	0
able	1
to	1

yes	1

they	1
really	1
are	0
they	1
don't	0
like	0
to	0
keep	1
them	0
longer	1
than	0
a	0
week	0

so	1
so	0
there	0
is	1
some	1
good	1
to	1
it	0

yeah	1

uh	0
sometimes	0
too	1
it's	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
dumb	1
job	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
fam[ilies]	1
well	1
the	0
families	1
do	0
not	1
necessarily	1
uh	0
know	0
what	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
them_1	0
and	0

what	1
do	0
you	0
mean	1

and	0
they	0
don't	1
wanna	0
take	0
the	0
responsibility	1
so	0
they	0
will	0
put	1
them_1	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	0
home	0

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

so	0
you	1
see	1
uh	0
there's	0
both	1
sides	1
to	0
it	1
too	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
think	0

yeah	1
and	0
it	1
depends	1
on	1
how	1
how	0
sick	1
the	0
person	1
is	0
too	1
and	1
what	0
you're	0
capable	1
of	0
like	0
if	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
family	1
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	0
know	1
of	0
your	0
own	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
um	0
i	1
would	0
personally	0
like	0
it	0
if	0
my	1
parents	0
were	0
to	0
get	0
ill	1
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
them	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
if	0
i	1
had	0
the	0
money	0
with	0
some	0
help	1
that's	1
not	0
always	0
possible	1

that's	1
true	1

but	1
um	0
to	0
the	0
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
until	1
it	0
gets	1
impossible	1

i	0
think	1
that's	1
also	1
where	1
you're	1
gonna	1
to	0
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	0
are	1
going	1
to	0
it's	1
there's	0
not	0
a	1
choice	1
it's	0
because_1	1
there	0
it's	0
not	1
economically	0
feasible	1
even	0
to	1
put	1
them_1	0
in	1
a	1
nursing	0
home	1

right	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

so	0
that	0
that	1
option	1
sometimes	1
is	0
not	1
available	1
if	0
they	1
do	0
not	0
have	1
the	0
uh	1
either	0
medicare	1
or	0
insurance	1
to	0
cover	1
it	0

that's	0
true	1
yeah	0

so	1

but	1
i	1
think	1
nursing	1
homes	0
can	1
be	0
good	1
just	0
depends	1
on	0
what	0
kind	1
they	1
are	0
you	0
know	1
an	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
check	0
them_1	0
out	0
ahead	1
of	0
time	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
there's	1
also	1
some	1
that	0
are	0
set	1
up	1
for	1
specialties	1
uh	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
i	1
know	0
some	0
el[derly]	0
unfortunately	1
some	1
elderly	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	0
or	1
have	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
alzheimer's	1
or	0
where	1
they	1
wander	1
or	0
or	0
um	0
confused	1
or	1
have	0
some	1
mental	1
problems	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1
that	1
they're	1

and	0
you	1
need	1
a	1
special	0
nursing	1
home	0
for	0
that	1
you	1
need	1
one	1
that	0
has	1
a	0
unit	1
that's	1
locked	1
where	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	1
to	0
get	0
out	1
and	1
roam	0
around	1

yeah	1

and	0
you	0
need	1
people	1
who	0
are	1
trained	1
for	0
that	0
type	1
of	1
problem	1

right	1

an[d]	0
know	1
what	0
they're	0
doing	1
with	0
that	0

yeah	0
so	1
so	0
there's	0
different	1
types	1
of	0
nursing	0
homes	0
i	0
think	1

yeah	1
well	0
my	0
uh	0
grandmother's	1
not	1
really	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
but	0
a	0
retirement	1
home	0
that	0
also	0
has	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
sort	0
of	0
attached	1
to	1
it	0
and	1
she	1
really	0
liked	1
the	0
idea	0
of	0
of	0
moving	1
there	0
she's	1
not	0
ill	1
yet	1

um-hum	0

but	1
um	0
she	1
worked	0
there	0
as	0
a	0
volunteer	1
for	0
about	0
ten	1
years	1
and	0
then	0
she	1
decided	0
that	0
um	0
she's	0
eighty	1
five	0
years	0
old	1
that	0
eventually	1
you	1
know	0
she	0
she	0
doesn't	1
want	1
her	0
family	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
her	0
and	0
being	0
a	0
burden	1
she's	0
very	0
independent	1
so	0
she's	1
in	0
this	0
nursing	1
home	0
it's	0
out	0
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
um	0
she	0
really	1
enjoys	1
it	1
right	1
now	1
because	1
she	0
doesn't	1
have	0
to	0
wash	0
dishes	1
or	0
[laughter-cook]	1

gives	1
her	0
a	1
little	0
bit	0
of	1
her	1
own	1
independence	1
but	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
she	0
still	1
has	1
uh	0
a	1
security	1
there	0

right	1
some	1
support	1
and	0
then	1
there's	0
also	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
a	0
wing	1
for	0
those	1
people	0
that	1
do	1
get	0
sick	1
and	0
what	1
i	1
like	0
about	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
she	1
likes	0
about	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
she	0
knows	1
everybody	0
there	0
now	1
and	1
then	1
so	1
if	0
she	0
ever	0
does	1
become	0
ill	0
um	0
it'll	1
be	1
like	1
family	1
around	0
her	1

that's	0
right	1
and	0
i	0
i've	0
seen	1
some	0
of	1
them	0
like	0
that	1
too	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
also	1
they	0
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
activities	1
going	1
on	1
for	0
the	1
ones	1
who	1
are	1
more	1
active	1

of	0
like	0
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
sick	1
place	1

um-hum	0

no	1
she	0

had	0
a	0
great	1
social	1
life	0
and	0
she	0
travels	1
and	0
um	0

in	0
in	0
missouri	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
mountains	1
and	0
it's	0
beautiful	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
i	1
hope	1
that	0
i	1
have	0
something	0
like	0
that	0
when	0
i	1
get	0
older	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
of	0

the	0
uh	0
elderly	1
uh	0
person	1
who's	0
going	0
in	1

those	0
choi[ces]	1
those	0
choices	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
in	0
advance	1
and	0
sometimes	1
the	1
choices	1
uh	0
because	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	0
the	0
illness	1

indiana	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
quilting	1
frame	1

she	1
would	0
she	1
would	0
quilt	1
whole	0
quilts	1
by	0
herself	1

oh	0
my	0
god	1

um	1
yes	1
which	0
i	1
was	0
always	1
amazed	1
i	1
have	1
one	1
of	0
them_1	0
um	0
but	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
have	1
the	0
quilting	1
frame	1
and	0
then	0
to	0
actually	1
do	1
that	0
it's	0
a	0
tremendous	1
amount	0
of	0
work	1

well	1
i	1
haven't	1
done	0
tons	1
of	0
them_1	0
but	0
um	0
i	0
used	1
to	0
do	0
more	1
before	1
um	1
before	1
i	0
had	0
before	1
we	0
got	0
our	0
baby	1
but	0

have	0
you	1
think	1
children	1
you	1
can	0
um	1
use	0
crafts	1
to	1
make	0
wonderful	1
things	1
for	1
children	1

uh-huh	0

i	0
think	1
when	0
babies	1
i	0
think	0
afghans	1
and	0
and	1
the	1
crocheted	1
little	0
sweaters	1
and	0
are	0
are	0
wonderful	1
and	0
and	1
they'll	0
wear	1
them_1	0

yeah	1
exactly	1

once	1
they	0
get	0
old	1
enough	0
to	1
talk	1
then	0
they	0
no	1
longer	0
will	0
wear	1
[laughter-your]	0

well	0
one	1
thing	0
that	0
i	0
like	0
about	0
this	0
fabric	1
painting	0
thing	0
is	0
i	1
can	0
just	0
make	0
a	0
t-shirt	1
and	0
put	0
a	0
little	0
ruffle	1
around	0
it	0
and	0
then	1
um	0
cut	1
out	0
a	0
little	0
pattern	1
from	1
the	0
material	1
from	0
some	1
material	0
like	0
flowers	1
or	0
something	0
and	0
make	1
um	0
a	0
design	1
or	0
you	1
know	0
a	0
little	0
arrangement	1
or	0
something	1
on	0
the	0
shirt	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
fuse	1
it	1
on	0
with	0
heat	1
and	0
bond	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
then	1
paint	1
around	1
it	0
and	0
i	0
usually	1
sew	1
sew	1
around	1
the	0
flower	1
whatever	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
i	0
paint	1
around	1
it	0
so	1
you	0
can't	1
see	1
the	0
stitching	1
as	0
much	1
doe[s]	0
does	0
that	1
make	0
sense	1
to	0
you	0
so	0

oh	0
yes	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
very	0
clever	1
it's	1
uh	0
funny	1
that	0
you	0
said	1
that	0
for	1
christmas	1
my	0
daughter	1
and	0
i	1
received	1
matching	1
sweat	1
shirts	0
that	0
a	1
friend	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
ours	0
a	0
beautiful	1
christmas	1
design	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0
they	1
were	1
matching	1
and	0
they	0
were	0
lovely	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
washed	1
them	0
although	0
i	1
took	1
the	1
precaution	1
of	0
turning	1
them	1
inside	1
out	1
i	0
really	1
didn't	0
do	1
anything	0
else	1
and	0
truly	1
everything	1
fell	1
off	1
or	1
most	1
of	0
it	1
so	1

oh	0
sure	1

uh-huh	0

oh	0
really	1

so	1
i	1
ha[d]	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
bought	1
just	0
some	1
cloth	1
glue	1
and	1
glued	1
it	0
all	1
back	1
and	0
i	0
bought	1
the	0
paint	1
and	1
redid	1
most	0
of	1
the	0
edges	1

oh	0

and	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
[laughter-salvageable]	1
and	0
i	0
but	0
it's	0
so	1
i'm	0
familiar	1
with	0
that	0
but	0
i	0
think	1
you're	0
very	0
clever	1
to	0
um	0
sew	1
around	1
the	0
edges	0
i	0
think	0
gluing	1
alone	1
certainly	1
would	0
if	0
you	0
wash	1
it	0
any	0
amount	0
of	0
time	1
it	0
tends	1
to	0
kind	0
of	0
come	0
loose	1
at	0
the	0
edges	1

well	0

yeah	1
someone	1
told	1
me	0
that	0
that	0
it	0
that	0
they	0
had	0
done	1
it	0
both	1
ways	0
and	0
i've	1
always	0
after	1
hearing	1
that	0
i	0
always	0
sewed	1
it	0
on	0
even	1
even	1
with	0
the	0
uh	0
a	0
loose	1
zigzag	1
even	0
helps	1
and	0
um	0

okay	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
um	1
this	1
is	1
probably	1
really	1
a	1
good	1
subject	1
for	1
me	1
because	1
i	1
really	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
uh	1
hand	1
work	1
uh	1
mostly	1
i	1
do	1
needlepoint	1
i	1
guess	1

oh	1
really	1

but	0
um	1

what	1
kinds	1
of	1
things	1
have	1
you	1
done	1

um	1
well	1
i've	1
made	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
baby	0
gifts	1

aha	1

it	0
seem	1
like	1
that's	1
like	1
especially	1
lately	1
there's	1
been	1
so	0
many	1
babies	1
that	1
uh	1
bibs	1
and	0
blankets	1
and	1
things	0
like	1
that	0
wall	1
hangings	0
um	0

do	1
you	1
ever	1
keep	1
any	0
of	1
your	1
stuff	1

isn't	1
that	0
funny	1
no	0

i	1
do	0
crochet	1
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
uh	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
and	0
i	1
have	0
very	0
little	1
of	0
my	0
own	0
stuff	1
and	1
and	1
it	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	1
embarrassing	1
people	1
say	1
let	1
me	0
see	1
some	0
of	1
your	0
work	1

oh	1
well	1
can	1
you	0
go	1
to	1
so	1
and	1

yeah	0
isn't	1
that	1
funny	1
i	1
guess	1
i	1
do	1
have	1
one	1
thing	1
um	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	0
gave	1
me	1
a	1
clock	1
kit	1
and	1

ooh	0

and	1
i	1
i	1
needlepointed	1
the	0
the	0
face	1
and	1
i	1
uh	1
kept	0
that	1
because	1
she	1
gave	1
me	1
that	1
so	0

that	1
that	0
would	1
be	1
definitely	1
something	1
you'd	0
want	1
to	1
keep	1

oh	0
yeah	1
and	0
it's	0
real	0
neat	1

was	1
was	0
the	1
whole	0
face	1
done	1
or	0
just	1
the	1
numbers	1
uh	1
and	0
and	0
like	0
minute	0
marks	1

um	0
basically	1
the	0
the	0
whole	1
well	1
no	0
i	1
guess	0
the	1
minute	0
marks	0
but	1
the	0
minute	1
marks	0
are	1
done	1
they're	0
like	1
hearts	0

oh	1

and	1
then	0
the	0
at	0
the	0
numbers	1
they	1
they're	1
kind	0
of	0
outlined	1
and	0
stuff	1
it	1
it	1
was	0
quite	1
bit	0
of	1
work	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
it	1
was	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
too	1
i	1
really	1
like	0
doing	1
stuff	1
like	1
that	1
so	1

i	1
did	1
some	0
needlepoint	1
years	1
ago	1
and	0
then	1
i	1
got	0
into	0
the	0
bargello	1

oh	0

just	0
gone	0
blank	1
but	1
it's	0
used	1
wi[th]	0
uh	1
with	0
yarn	1
and	1
it	0
usually	1
takes	1
long	1
stitches	1
over	0
two	1
or	0
three	0
openings	1
in	0
the	0
cloth	1

huh	0

and	1
you	0
weave	1
intricate	0
patterns	1
and	0
use	0
different	0
colors	1
like	1
it	0
could	0
be	0
a	0
flame	1
stitch	0
where	0
so	0
rather	1
than	0
drawing	1
a	0
picture	1
you're	0
making	0
a	0
design	1
like	0
a	0
geometric	1
or	1
whatever	1
and	1
it	0
was	0
used	1
quite	0
often	1
in	0
the	0
colonial	1
times	0
to	0
uh	0
uh	0
to	0
upholster	1
chairs	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1
as	0
well	1
as	0
the	0
crewel	1
um	0
embroidery	1
work	0
that	0
was	0
done	1
on	1
them	0

wow	1
well	0
that's	0
interesting	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
what	0
kind	1
of	1
things	1
did	1
you	1
do	1

what	0
i	1
did	1
when	1
when	0
i	0
was	0
doing	1
that	0
was	0
mostly	0
pillows	0
you	0
know	0
for	0
sofas	0
and	0
so	0
forth	0
and	1
i	1
can't	1
find	0
one	1
that	0
i've	1
done	1

oh	0

it's	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
things	1
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	1
give	0
them	0
away	1
but	1
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
if	1
it's	0
been	0
my	1
color	1
choice	1
or	0
multiple	1
moves	1
or	1
or	1
what	1
and	1

yeah	0

and	1
it	0
i	1
was	0
so	0
proud	1
of	0
them	0
when	1
i	0
got	1
them	1
finished	1
but	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	0
where	0
they	1
are	1

what	0
did	1
you	0
call	0
that	0

bargello	0
it's	0
b	1
a	0
r	1
g	1
e	1
double	0
l	1
o	1

huh	0
that's	0
i've	0
never	1
heard	1
of	0
that	0
before	1
i've	0
probably	1
seen	1
it	0
though	0
i	0

i	0
suspect	0
you	0
i	0
suspect	0
you	0
have	0

i	0
mean	0
when	0
you	0
described	0
it	0

yeah	0
i	0
mean	1
when	0
you	0
described	1
it	1
it	1
sounded	1
like	1
something	1
you	1
know	0
that	0
would	1
be	1
around	1
i	1
guess	0
but	1
um	0
i've	0
never	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
before	0
and	1
it's	0
really	0
interesting	0
um	0
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
decorated	1
baskets	1
and	0
stuff	0
before	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
but	0
i've	0
kind	1
of	0
gotten	0
out	0
of	1
that	1
i	0
use	1
to	0
do	0
a	0
lot	1
more	1
and	0
sell	1
at	0
craft	1
shows	1

me	0
too	0

really	0

yeah	0
that's	0
interesting	0

yeah	0
it	0
[laughter-is]	0

how	1
did	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
choose	0
this	1
subject	0
tonight	1
that's	0
funny	0
uh	0
uh	0
what	1
how	0
did	0
you	1
what	0
kinds	1
of	0
decorations	1
did	0
you	0
use	1
with	0
the	0
bas[kets]	1
how	0
were	0
you	0
decorating	1
the	0
baskets	1

oh	1
basically	1
bows	0
and	1
lace	0
uh	1
ribbons	0
um	0

um	0

um	0
i	1
really	0
wanted	0
to	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
so	0
many	1
of	0
them	0
now	1
have	0
the	0
ribbons	1
where	0
i'm	0
not	1
sure	0
how	1
they	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
the	0
ribbons	0
they	0
make	0
them	0
they	0
like	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	1
to	0
explain	0
it	0
they	0
make	0
them	0
hard	0
you	0
know	0

like	0
fabric	0
that's	0
been	0
stiffened	1
in	0

yeah	0

yes	1

i've	1
never	0
done	1
that	1
and	0
those	1
are	0
so	0
neat	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
would	0
really	1
like	1
to	0
do	0
those	1
but	1
um	0

i've	0
seen	0
some	0
and	0
there	0
there	0
they	0
i	0
suspect	1
they're	0
fairly	0
simple	1
because	0
the	0
one	1
lady	0
i've	0
seen	1
i	0
know	1
that	0
does	1
it	0
i've	0
never	0
asked	1
her	0
any	0
questions	1
but	0
she	1
has	0
three	1
kids	0
all	1
under	0
the	0
age	1
of	0
like	0
six	1

and	1
and	0
they're	1
all	1
a	0
handful	1
so	0
it's	0
got	1
to	0
be	0
something	0
she	1
can	0
do	0
fairly	1
easily	0
and	0
fairly	1
quickly	0

oh	0
definitely	0
yeah	0

when	1
i	0
do	1
um	0
crochet	1
it's	0
it's	0
usually	1
the	0
the	0
lacy	1
victorian	1
type	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
and	1

oh	0

and	1
i	1
stiffen	1
those	1
with	0
a	0
a	0
glue	1
mixture	1
it's	0
like	1
white	1
glue	1
and	0
it	0
may	1
be	1
something	1
similar	1
to	0
that	1
that	0
the	0
fabric	1
is	0
dipped	1
in	1
and	0
then	1
um	0
allowed	0
to	0
dry	1
in	0
those	1
those	0
draping	1
bows	1
i	0
mean	0
those	0
draping	1
streamers	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0

oh	0

i	0
was	0
just	0
there's	0
bound	1
to	0
be	0
some	0
kind	0
of	0
fabric	1
stiffener	0
like	0
that	0
that's	0
very	0
similar	1
that's	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
melt	1
too	1
much	0
with	0
uh	0
uh	0
high	1
humidity	1
in	1
in	1
a	0
room	1

yeah	0

that's	1
i	0
think	1
that's	0
what	0
my	1
concern	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
wasn't	1
really	0
sure	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
how	1
they	1
would	0
last	1

do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
my	0
concern	1
is	1
how	0
will	0
i	0
dust	0
this	0
thing	1

you're	0
[laughter-right]	0
no	1

i'm	0
[laughter-terrible]	0

no	1
that's	0
true	0
[laughter-though]	1
that's	0
funny	0

so	0
many	0
of	0
my	0
crafts	0
well	0
right	0
now	1
i'm	0
looking	0
at	0
a	0
little	0
uh	0
uh	0
quilted	1
uh	0
uh	0
hanging	1
it's	1
like	0
it's	1
a	1
flag	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	1
wash	0
it	1
because	0
that	0
would	1
start	1
breaking	0
down	0
the	0
batting	1
and	1
so	0
forth	0
but	0
it's	0
such	1
a	0
dust	1
collector	0
to	0
be	0
out	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
most	1
of	0
my	1
things	0
are	1
dust	1
collectors	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
hate	0
to	0
dust	1

i	1
know	0

so	1
that's	0
the	0
first	0
thing	1
i	0
think	0
of	0
is	0
how	1
easy	0
would	0
this	0
thing	0
be	0
to	0
clean	1

that's	0
funny	0
no	0
i	0
just	0
um	0
i	1
don't	0
i	1
have	0
really	1
have	0
gotten	1
out	1
of	0
it	0
i	0
don't	1
do	1
it	0
quite	0
as	0
much	1
as	0
i	0
used	1
to	0
um	1
i	0
guess	1
because	1
i	0
i	0
went	1
back	0
to	0
school	1
so	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
as	0
much	0
time	1

oh	0
you	0
don't	1
have	0
time	1

now	0
and	0
i	0
have	1
two	0
children	1
[laughter-also]	0
[laughter-so]	0

you	0
definitely	1
don't	0
have	0
[laughter-time]	0

it	0
keeps	0
me	0
very	0
busy	0
but	0
i	1
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
do	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
get	0
the	0
chance	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	0
it's	0
so	1
relaxing	1
to	0
just	0
sit	1
and	0
but	0
once	1
i	0
get	0
started	1
i	0
can't	1
put	0
it	0
down	1
i	0
just	0

i	0
have	0
a	0
similar	1
problem	0
i've	0
got	1
to	0
have	0
time	1
or	0
i	0
don't	0
even	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
into	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

and	0
so	1
i	0
end	1
up	1
lots	0
of	1
time	1
not	1
doing	0
anything	0
at	1
all	1

i	0
know	0
i	0
started	1
a	0
project	1
it's	0
been	1
over	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
that	0
i	0
swore	1
i	0
was	0
going	1
to	0
finish	1
for	0
somebody	1
for	0
[laughter-christmas]	1
and	0

you	0
just	1
didn't	0
say	0
which	0
christmas	1
right	1

that's	1
what	0
i	0
keep	0
telling	1
this	0
[laughter-person]	1
well	0
i	0
didn't	1
tell	1
you	0
what	0
year	1

what	0
was	0
this	0
project	0

um	1
well	1
it's	1
a	0
it's	0
uh	1
cross	1
stitch	0
and	1
it's	0
a	0
picture	1
and	0
it's	0
a	0
wildlife	1
it	0
has	0
deer	1
and	0
trees	1
and	0
it's	0
really	0
beautiful	0
but	0
it's	0
going	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
work	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
i	0
have	1
worked	0
on	0
it	1
quite	0
a	1
bit	0
but	0
not	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
just	1
so	0
hard	1

now	0
this	0
is	1
this	0
is	0
done	0
in	0
the	0
needlepoint	1

uh-huh	0
uh	0
well	0
i	1
shouldn't	0
it's	1
counted	1
cross	0
stitch	1
actually	1
is	0
what	0
i'm	1
doing	1
and	0
so	0
it's	1
really	1
since	0
it's	0
counted	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
work	1

yes	0
yes	0
i	0
do	0
know	0
i	0

yep	0

i	0
have	0
done	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
of	0
that	1
but	0
i've	0
decided	1
that	0
that's	0
something	0
that	0
demands	1
my	0
time	1
my	1
my	0
to[tal]	1
my	0
total	1
attention	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
i've	0
got	0
to	0
have	1
total	1
almost	0
total	1
silence	0
i	0
can't	1
really	0
watch	1
television	0
if	0
the	0
pattern	1
is	0
very	0
intricate	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you'd	0
have	1
lots	0
of	0
shading	1
on	0
that	0
particular	1
piece	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

yep	0

it	0
is	0
not	1
does	0
not	0
sound	0
like	0
an	0
easy	1
one	0
to	0
finish	1

no	0
it	0
really	0
isn't	0
and	0
i	0
tell	0
you	0
really	1
i	0
could	0
just	1
kick	1
myself	1
for	0
even	1
starting	1
[laughter-it]	0
because	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
feeling	1
i'm	0
never	1
going	0
to	1
get	1
it	0
done	1
i'm	1
probably	1
going	0
to	0
hear	1
about	0
it	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
[laughter-my]	0
[laughter-life]	1

oh	0
i'm	0
sure	0
you'll	0
get	0
it	0
done	0
but	0
it	0
just	0
maybe	0
not	0
on	0
the	0
original	0
obviously	0
not	0
on	0
the	0
original	0
time	0
schedule	0

no	1
that's	0
true	0
i	1
i	1
just	1
don't	1
know	0
when	1
i'm	0
ever	1
it	0
just	1
seems	1
like	0
there's	1
just	0
never	1
enough	0
time	1
to	0
to	1
pick	1
it	1
up	0
and	1
do	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
really	0
hard	1
but	0
i	0
really	0
do	0
en[joy]	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
i	0
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
it's	0
just	0
hard	0

just	0
hard	0
finding	1
the	0
time	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
dedicated	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	1
many	0
other	0
things	1
that	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
done	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
meantime	1
like	0
i	0
said	0
so	0
many	0
baby	1
gifts	0
i've	0
made	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
bibs	1
and	0
wall	1
hangings	0
and	0
so	1
you	1
know	0
those	1
don't	0
take	1
much	0
time	0
at	0
all	1
so	0
it's	0
no	0
big	0
deal	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
pick	1
those	0
up	1
and	0
do	1
them	0

do	0
you	1
do	0
you	1
use	0
patterns	1
i	0
mean	0
like	0
a	0
book	1
of	0
patterns	1
or	0
do	0
you	0
go	0
out	0
an	0
buy	1
a	0
a	0
kit	1
like	1
for	0
a	0
bib	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

no	0
no	0
i	0
usually	1
just	0
buy	0
a	0
pattern	1
book	1
i	0
have	1
several	1
pattern	1
books	0
and	0
i	0
just	1
go	0
with	0
those	1

okay	0

and	1
then	1
i	0
buy	1
the	0
bibs	1
separate	1
usually	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
a	1
little	1
bit	0
cheaper	1
in	1
the	0
long	1
run	1
and	0
then	0
i	1
just	1
use	0
whatever	1
colors	1
i	0
want	0
to	0
i	0
don't	0
usually	0
use	1
the	0
colors	0
they	0
tell	1
me	0
to	0

um	0

and	1
it	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
what	1
it	0
is	1
you	0
know	0
but	1
some	1
things	0
especially	1
letters	1
if	1
they	0
suggest	1
certain	1
colors	1
for	0
letters	1
i	1
just	1
go	1
with	0
whatever	1
i	0
want	1
to	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
would	0
do	0
too	1

yeah	0
i	0
yeah	1
yeah	0

or	0
or	0
whatever	0
i	0
have	0
[laughter-that's]	0

there's	1
yeah	1
there's	1
a	0
a	0
few	1
designs	0
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
done	0
myself	1
but	0
not	1
very	0
many	1
real	0
simple	1
ones	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
do	1
i've	0
made	1
i	0
made	1
a	0
little	1
uh	0
uh	0
little	1
uh	0
little	0
thumb	0
print	1
and	0
made	1
it	0
a	0
bunny	1

ooh	0

it	0
was	0
really	0
easy	0
i	0
mean	0
just	1
just	1
did	0
a	0
thumb	0
print	1
you	0
know	1

what	0
with	0
ink	0

uh-huh	0

oh	0
okay	0

and	0
then	1
see	0
i	0
didn't	1
cross	1
stitch	0
the	0
actual	1
thumb	1
print	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
was	1
just	0
the	0
ink	1
and	0
then	0
i	0
made	1
the	0
ears	1
and	0
little	0
eyes	1
and	0
nose	1
and	0
mouth	1
that	0
was	0
so	0
simple	0
[laughter-and]	0

oh	0
that	0
sounds	0
really	0
neat	0

it	0
didn't	1
take	0
anything	1
at	0
all	1
and	0

did	0
you	0
do	1
did	0
you	0
use	1
like	0
a	0
stamp	0
pad	1
an	0
ink	1
okay	0

um-hum	0
and	0
then	0
i	0
just	0

okay	0
so	0
you	0
just	0
just	0
like	0
being	0
finger	0
printed	0

so	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
any	1
painting	1
projects	1
lately	1

yeah	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
topic	1
for	1
me	1
because_1	1
i	1
just	1
did	1
my	1
first	1
two	1
painting	1
projects	1
ever	1
it	1

oh	1
really	1

was	1
not	1
not	1
a	1
big	1
deal	1

what	1
kind	1
of	1
painting	1
was	1
it	1

two	1
little	1
deals	1

the	1
first	1
one	0
um	1
i	1
helped	1
someone	1
repaint	1
an	1
apartment	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
easy	1

uh-huh	1
it	0
was	1
it	0

yeah	1
and	1
i've	1
never	1
painted	1
anyth[ing]	1
i	1
always	1
thought	1
it	0
would	1
be	1
so	1
you	1
know	1
you'd	1
have	1
to	1
hire	1
someone	0
if	1
you	1
needed	0
to	1
paint	1
inside	1
your	1
house	1
or	1
something	1
but	1

yeah	1

but	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
it	1

oh	0
huh	1

and	1
the	1
second	1
one	1
was	1
i	1
bought	1
some	0
toys	1
at	0
a	1
um	1
at	1
a	1
craft	1
fair	0

uh-huh	1

they're	1
unfinished	1
wooden	1
book	1
ends	1
and	1
stuff	1
for	1
a	0
a	0
little	0
girl	1
for	0
christmas	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
just	1
decided	0
to	0
paint	1
them	1
and	0
that	1
wasn't	0
as	0
easy	1
as	0
painting	1
the	0
[laughter-apartment]	1
[laughter-was]	1

oh	0
w[ell]	0
what	1
kind	0
of	0
paint	1
did	1
you	0
use	1
for	0
the	0
um	1
bookends	1

well	1
it's	1
uh	0
it	1
that's	1
half	1
the	1
problem	1
right	0
there	1
is	1
that	0
it	0
wasn't	1
it	1
was	0
a	1
oil	1
base	0
so	0
i	1
had	1
to	0
get	0
and	1
when	1
i	1
painted	1
them_1	1
i	1
didn't	0
realize	1
that	0
we	0
didn't	0
have	1
any	0
uh	0
turpentine	1
or	0
paint	1
thinner	0
or	0
anything	0
in	0
the	0
house	1
so	0
i	0
had	0
it	0
had	0
it	0
all	1
over	0
my	0
hands	1
at	0
first	1
i	0
didn't	0
realize	0
you	0
know	0
i	1
had	0
never	0
painted	0
anything	1
so	0
i	0
didn't	0
realize	1
that	0
i	0
needed	1
that	0
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
kind	1
of	0
knew	0
in	0
the	0
back	1
of	0
my	0
mind	1

so	1
you	0
can't	1
use	0
oil	1
on	0
wood	1

well	1
no	1
you	0
can	1
use	0
it	0
on	0
wood	1
but	0
i	0
just	0
had	1
it	0
all	0
over	0
my	0
hands	1
and	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
wash	0
the	0
brushes	1
out	0
and	0
uh	0
wash	0
my	0
hands	1
and	0
you	0
can't	1
wash	0
it	0
off	0
with	0
water	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
get	0
the	0
uh	0
a	0
solution	1
and	0

oh	0
so	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
go	0
around	1
with	0
paint	1
all	1
over	0
you	1
temporarily	1
anyway	1

yeah	1
i	0
had	0
to	0
drive	1
to	0
the	0
store	1

yeah	1
i	0
had	0
to	0
drive	0
to	0
the	0
store	1
with	0
paper	0
towels	1
all	0
over	0
my	0
hands	1
to	0
go	0
buy	1
some	0
paint	0
thinner	0
and	0
right	1
back	1
and	0
everything	1
like	0
that	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0
then	0
um	0
uh	0
downstairs	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
apartment	1
i	0
just	0
use[d]	0
we	0
just	0
used	1
a	0
latex	1
base	1
and	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
drip	1
it	0
on	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
dripped	1
it	0
on	0
something	0
as	0
long	0
as	0
you	0
wiped	1
it	0
up	1
it	0
was	0
real	0
easy	1
to	0
clean	0
up	0

oh	0
is	0
that	1
what	0
you	0
usually	1
use	1
in	1
the	0
house	1
is	0
latex	1

yeah	1
and	0
and	1
it	0
it	1
just	0
like	1
the	1

hm	0

the	1
same	1
with	0
the	0
toys	1
it's	0
just	0
important	1
to	0
look	1
for	0
one	0
that	0
doesn't	0
have	0
lead	1
in	0
it	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
says	0
safe	1
for	0
children	1
and	0
all	0
that	1

uh-huh	0
yeah	0
heard	1
about	0
that	1
i	0
guess	0
a	0
friend	1
of	1
mine	0
had	1
a	1
uh	0
um	0
well	0
she	0
she	0
just	1
started	0
up	1
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0
and	1
uh	0
an[d]	0
the	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
real	1
strict	0
uh	0
restrictions	1
was	0
the	0
fact	1
that	0
she	1
had	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
special	1
kind	0
of	0
paint	1
that	0
was	1
fire	1
proof	1
and	1
lead	1
free	1
and	0
all	0
that	0
other	1
good	1
stuff	0

yeah	0

so	0
uh	0
she	1
had	0
that	1
done	0
but	0
uh	0

have	0
you	0
painted	1
anything	0
recently	1

well	1
um	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
i	1
had	0
to	1
paint	1
this	1
uh	1
the	0
inside	1
of	0
this	0
warehouse	1
thing	1
uh	0
that	0
you	0
keep	1
some	0
um	0
farm	1
equipment	0
in	0

wow	1
was	0
it	0
huge	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
um	0
what	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
just	0
coat	1
this	0
bare	1
wood	1
with	0
a	1
sealer	1
and	1
uh	1
i	0
had	1
this	0
big	0
five	1
gallon	1
jug	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
like	0
paint	1
thinner	0
i	0
mean	0
i	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
looked	1
just	0
like	0
it	0
was	0
the	0
viscosity	1
of	0
paint	1
thinner	0

yeah	0

but	0
uh	0
you	0
just	0
took	0
a	0
roller	1
and	0
put	0
it	0
on	1
there	0
and	0
uh	0
if	0
you	0
saw	1
that	0
the	0
wood	1
was	0
getting	0
wet	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
was	0
that	0
was	1
all	0
you	1
needed	1
so	0

wow	1

yeah	1
it	0
was	0
it	0
used	1
all	1
of	0
it	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
about	1
three	1
hundred	1
yards	1
worth	0
so	1
well	1
i	1
guess	1
it	1
worked	1
out	1
it	0
was	0
pretty	1
easy	1
actually	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
though	1
um	0
we're	0
lucky	1
that	0
we	0
didn't	0
have	0
to	0
do	1
any	0
detail	1
work	0
because_1	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
if	0
i	0
could	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0

i	0
don't	0
know	1
must	1
be	0
difficult	1

well	0
what	1
about	1
the	0
trim	1
in	0
your	0
house	1
did	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
do	0
that	1

no	0
it	0
was	0
j[ust]	0
it	0
was	1
really	0
easy	1
i	0
just	1
like	0
what	0
i	0
we	0
had	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
different	1
size	0
brushes	1
and	0
it	0
wa[s]	0
you	1
know	0
real	0
easy	1
i	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
went	0
around	0
the	0
trim	1
and	0
if	0
i[t]	0
and	0
there	0
was	0
wallpaper	1
like	0
i	0
was	0
do[ing]	0
just	0
doing	1
just	0
the	0
trim	1
of	0
the	0
around	0
the	0
doors	0
and	0
windows	1
and	0
there	0
was	0
wallpaper	1
and	0
if	0
we	0
got	0
it	0
on	0
the	0
wallpaper	1
a	0
little	0
bit	1
we	0
just	0
wipe	1
it	0
right	0
away	1
before	0
it	0
dried	1
it	0

um-hum	1

it	0
came	0
right	0
off	1
so	1

oh	0
yeah	0

so	1
there	0
was	0
no	1
major	1
mistakes	0
there	0
was	0

did	0
you	0
have	1
uh	0
one	1
coat	0
or	0
two	1

uh	0
two	1
actually	1

um-hum	1

um	0
and	0
it	0
there	1
was	0
um	1
you	0
know	1
around	0
the	0
windows	1
if	0
you	0
got	0
it	1
on	0
the	0
glass	1
we	1
let	0
it	1
dry	1
and	0
scraped	1
it	0
after	0
that	1
but	0
that	0

yeah	1
that	1
would	0
be	0
really	1
time	1
a	0
a	1
time	1
saver	1

well	1
yeah	1
if	0
you	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
didn't	0
tape	1
anything	0

we	0
weren't	1
that	0
careful	1
but	0
it	0
wasn't	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
it's	0
it's	0
funny	1
it's	0
like	0
if	0
you	1
just	0
go	1
slow	1
you	0
don't	1
get	0
or	0
at	0
least	0
i	1
didn't	1
get	1
that	0
many	1
mistakes	1
i	0

um-hum	0

i	0
didn't	0
make	1
that	0
many	0
mistakes	0

oh	0
me	1
i	1
would've	0
had	1
to	0
have	0
taped	1
the	0
whole	1
thing	1
and	1
then	0
brushed	1
around	0
the	0
edges	1
and	1
and	0
then	1
i'd	0
have	0
probably	0
rolled	1
it	0
on	0
i'd	0
uh	0
it	1
would've	0
taken	1
me	1
forever	1

why	1
just	0
because	0
you'd	0
be	0
afraid	1
to	0
do	0
it	0
or	0
have	0
you	0
done	1
it	0
be[fore]	0

yeah	1
well	1
the	0
first	1
time	0
it'd	0
probably	0
would've	0
tooken	1
me	0
forever	1
so	0

well	1
it	0
wasn't	1
if	0
it	0
was	0
my	0
own	1
i	0
would've	1
but	0
my	0
friend	1
said	0
oh	0
just	0
go	0
ahead	1
you	0
just	0
go	0
ahead	1
it's	0
easy	1
i	0

i	0
said	0
okay	1
it's	0
your	0
place	1

well	1
how	0
long	1
did	1
it	0
take	1
y'all	0

well	1
a	0
couple	1
of	0
weekends	1
we	0
would	0
go	0
down	1
two	0
or	0
three	0
hours	1
on	0
the	0
weekends	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0

so	0
there	0
was	1
two	0
of	0
y'all	1

no	1
there	0
was	0
they	1
were	0
doing	0
all	1
sorts	1
of	0
repairs	0
and	0
there	0
was	0
i	0
was	0
just	0
painting	1
because_1	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
how	0
to	0
do	1
anything	0
[laughter-else]	1
so	0

well	0
that's	1
easy	0
enough	1

so	0
there's	0
a	0
whole	1
bunch	0
of	0
people	0
yeah	1

um	0

so	0
now	1
i	0
feel	0
like	0
if	0
i	0
ever	0
buy	0
a	0
house	1
i	0
can	0
probably	0
paint	1
if	0
nothing	0
else	1

i	1
think	0
i	0
could	0
probably	1
do	0
it	1
uh	0
as	0
long	1
as	0
the	0
hardware	1
store	0
told	1
me	0
what	0
to	1
buy	1
then	1
i	0
could	0
do	0
it	0

yeah	0

but	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
went	0
in	1
to	0
a	0
hardware	1
store	0
to	0
get	0
paint	1
for	0
those	0
toys	1
and	0
the	0
guy	1
said	0
oh	0
get	0
this	1
it's	0
a	0
nice	1
shiny	0
gloss	1
which	0
was	0
true	1

but	1
i	0
didn't	0
realize	0
what	0
you	1
know	0
a	0
pain	1
it	0
is	0
to	0
clean	0
the	0
brushes	1
and	0
everything	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
latex	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
worth	1
the	0
shi[ne]	0

um-hum	0

i	1
pay	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
taxes	1
i	1
guess	1
because	1
i	1
i	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
amount	1
of	1
money	1
and	1
uh	1
the	1
taxes	1
that	1
i	1
pay	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
as	1
a	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
statement	1
i	1
feel	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
get	1
my	0
money's	1
worth	1
for	1

okay	1

i'm	1
not	1
sure	1
though	1
whether	1
i	0
feel	1
i	0
guess	0
i	1
am	1
sure	0
that	1
i	0
feel	1
that	1
in	1
general	1
though	1
uh	0
the	0
allocation	0
uh	0
of	0
the	0
taxes	0
in	0
certain	1
areas	1
i[sn't]	0
isn't	0
correct	1

well	1
i'm	1
sure	1
that	1
uh	1
probably	1
every	1
person	1
in	1
this	0
country	1
would	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
that	1
because_1	1
everybody	1
has	1
a	0
different	1
idea	1
of	1
where	0
the	0
money	1
should	1
go	1

well	0
i	0
i	0
lately	0
i	0
guess	1
um	1
uh	0
or	1
at	0
least	0
for	0
the	0
last	0
t[wenty]	0
twenty	0
years	0
or	1
so	0
i've	0
felt	0
that	0
the	0
expenditures	0
of	0
our	0
taxes	0
into	0
high	0
cost	0
uh	0
defense	0
items	0
at	0
least	0
in	0
the	0
last	0
ten	0
years	0
have	1
been	0
uh	0
there's	0
been	0
and	0
extraordinary	1
amount	1
of	0
money	1
spent	1
there	1
and	1
i'm	0
not	1
really	0
sure	1
that	0
that	1
we've	0
gotten	0
our	0
money's	1
worth	0
there	1
uh	0
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
outcome	0
of	0
the	0
desert	0
storm	1
uh	0
desert	0
shield	1
uh	0
situations	1

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

uh	1
i	0
guess	0
my	1
particular	1
beef	1
is	1
that	0
having	1
participated	1
in	0
the	0
mi[litary]	1
military	1
off	0
and	0
on	1
over	0
the	1
over	0
the	0
years	1
of	0
being	1
called	1
back	1
and	0
things	0
of	0
that	0
nature	1
is	0
uh	0
i've	0
found	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
there's	0
an	0
extraordinary	1
amount	0
of	0
waste	1
i	0
take	1
that	0
as	0
a	0
as	0
a	0
given	1
in	0
any	0
military	0
operation	1
and	0

oh	1
yeah	1
no	0
argument	0
here	1

yeah	0
and	0
i	0
gue[ss]	0
i	0
i	1
should	1
imagine	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
what	1
the	0
what	0
the	0
problem	1
why	0
i	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
a	0
little	1
concerned	1
about	0
today	1
is	0
that	1
this	1
uh	0
rather	1
uh	1
quick	1
and	1
and	0
easy	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0
shouldn't	0
say	0
easy	0
rather	0
quick	1
victory	0
in	1
the	0
in	0
in	0
the	0
uh	1
mideast	0
uh	1
uh	0
over	0
the	0
uh	1
iraqis	0
uh	0
might	1
lead	0
us	0
into	0
uh	1
a	0
false	0
sense	0
of	0
security	1
that	0
we	1
can	0
do	1
that	0
against	0
any	0
other	0
foe	0
i'm	1
i	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
what	1
other	0
foe	1
that	0
would	0
be	1
but	1
uh	0
i	0
i'm	1
just	0
getting	0
nervous	1
again	1
now	1
hearing	0
the	0
voices	1
come	1
up	0
that	0
there	0
has	0
to	0
be	1
increased	0
expenditures	1
in	0
that	0
area	1

yeah	0
well	1
of	1
course	1
uh	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
missiles	1
and	0
things	0
were	0
expended	1
in	0
the	0
course	1
of	0
fighting	0
the	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
and	1
the	0
inventory's	1
going	1
to	1
have	0
to	1
be	1
restocked	1
uh	0
on	1
now	1
i	1
work	1
for	0
ti	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	0
things	1
we	1
were	1
told	1
is	1
like	1
they	0
had	1
eleven	1
thousand	0
harm	1
missiles	1
which	0
ti	1
is	1
the	0
sole	0
supplier	1
for	0
and	1
they	0
used	0
up	1
two	0
thousand	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
in	1
the	1
war	1
so	0
they're	1
going	1
to	1
have	0
to	1
do	0
another	1
contract	1
to	1
restock	1
that	1
to	0
get	0
ready	1
in	0
case	0
something	1
else	1
is	0
needed	1

yeah	1
but	0
it	0
it	0
it	0
it	0
would	0
that	1
be	0
uh	0
well	0
let's	0
see	0
two	0
thousand	1
out	0
of	0
eleven	0
thousand	1
that's	0
about	1
a	0
little	0
over	1
twenty	1
per	0
cent	1
uh	0
i	1
i	1
should	0
imagine	1
that	1
that	0
would	1
be	1
to	1
keep	1
it	0
at	0
a	0
level	1
those	0
levels	1
i	0
guess	1
that	1
that	0
were	0
originally	1
appropriated	1
w[as]	0
was	0
when	1
the	1
soviet	1
threat	1
i	0
guess	1
was	0
perceived	1
as	0
being	1
a	0
greater	1
one	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
there's	0
very	0
much	0
of	0
a	0
threat	1
there	0
today	1
i	0
do	1
worry	1
about	1
what	1
nuclear	1
weapons	0
are	0
left	1
in	1
the	1
territories	1
uh	0
in	1
their	0
territory	1
over	0
there	1
and	0
who's	1
controlling	1
them	0
but	0

that	1
that's	0
true	0
that's	0
true	1

i	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
what	1
amount	1
of	0
what	0
amount	1
of	0
our	1
hardware	1
would	0
stop	1
some	0
fanatic	1
i	1
guess	1
from	0
doing	1
anything	1
uh	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
irrational	1

well	0
of	1
of	1
course	1
now	0
we	0
used	1
up	0
twenty	1
per	0
cents	1
per	0
cent	1
of	0
that	0
inventory	1
in	0
a	0
matter	1
of	1
just	0
a	1
few	1
weeks	1

right	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
uh	1
uh	0
ti	1
also	0
makes	0
the	0
missile	0
which	0
was	1
the	1
the	1
tv	1
laser	1
guided	0
bombs	1

yeah	0

and	1
and	0
a	0
big	0
percentage	1
of	0
that	1
was	1
expended	1
as	0
well	1
that	0
that	1
w[as]	1
that	0
was	0
just	1
a	0
matter	1
of	0

w[hat]	0
what	1
is	0
the	0
name	0
of	0
that	1

uh	1
it's	0
called	0
paveway	1

yes	0
yes	0

and	0
uh	1
a	1
big	0
percentage	1
of	1
that	0
was	1
used	0
up	1
during	1
that	0
conflict	1
also	1
so	0
tho[se]	1
those	1
are	1
two	1
areas	1
in	1
which	1
ti	1
stands	1
to	0
to	0
gain	1
some	0
some	0
short	1
term	0
business	0
to	0
restock	1
that	0

yeah	0
well	0
i	0
i	0
i'm	0
what	0
i'm	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	0
uh	0
it	0
concerned	0
about	0
talking	0
about	0
the	0
taxes	1
in	0
general	1
and	0
that	1
that	0
was	0
an	0
area	1
that	0
i	1
i	0
perceive	1
as	0
not	1
being	1
the	0
best	0
expenditure	1
for	0
the	0
amount	1
of	0
dollar	1
that	0
we're	0
taxed	1
for	0
uh	0
in	0
the	0
area	0
of	0
defense	0
or	0
perhaps	1
we	0
have	1
paid	0
too	0
much	0
there	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it	0
just	1
seems	0
to	0
me	1
that	0
over	0
the	0
years	1
now	1
the	1
and	1
and	0
it's	1
it's	0
a	0
cliche	1
i	0
i	0
but	0
i	0
see	1
it	0
myself	1
i	0
see	1
where	0
the	0
infrastructure	1
is	1
sort	0
of	0
breaking	0
down	0
the	0
roads	1
the	0
highways	1

oh	1
no	0
doubt	0

i	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
i	0
kn[ow]	0
i'm	0
familiar	0
with	0
some	0
some	0
upbeat	0
school	0
areas	0
so	0
i	0
don't	1
totally	1
agree	0
with	0
the	1
the	0
great	1
uh	0
uh	1
with	1
the	0
with	0
the	1
great	1
ex[penditure]	1
expenditure	1
of	0
effort	1
and	1
time	1
there	0
but	0
i	0
guess	0
overall	1
because	0
i	0
guess	0
i'm	0
not	0
associated	1
with	0
what	1
ghetto	1
schools	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
and	0
uh	0
rural	1
school	0
systems	0
are	0
like	1
i	1
i	0
should	0
imagine	0
that	1
would	0
take	0
an	0
enormous	0
expenditure	1

yeah	0
as	1
a	0
matter	1
of	1
fact	0
in	1
texas	1
um	0
we've	1
had	1
our	0
school	1
funding	1
system	0
declared	0
unconstitutional	1
by	1
the	1
a	0
state	1
judge	1
and	1
they	1
and	0
uh	0
the	1
legislature	1
just	0
passed	1
what	0
they	0
called	1
a	1
robin	1
hood	1
bill	1
which	1
basically	1
what	1
it	1
does	1
is	0
it	0
takes	1
extra	1
money	0
from	1
the	1
more	1
affluent	1
school	1
districts	1
that	0
are	1
that	0
are	0
you	1
know	1
come	0
from	1
local	1
taxes	1
and	0
send	1
them	0
to	0
other	1
parts	0
of	0
the	0
state	1
that	0
are	0
not	1
so	0
affluent	1

um-hum	0

that	1
they	0
don't	0
have	1
a	0
broad	0
based	0
income	0
tax	1
that	0
funds	1
the	0
educational	0
system	1
or	0

uh	0
well	0

or	0
is	0
it	0
all	0
funded	1
out	0
of	0
local	1
taxes	1

okay	0
to	0
g[ive]	1
to	0
give	1
you	0
some	0
perspective	1
this	1
this	0
town	1
that	0
i	1
had	0
lived	1
in	0
for	0
sometime	1
in	0
nineteen	1
eighty	0
three	0
was	0
funded	1
sixty	0
five	0
per	0
cent	0
by	0
state	0
funds	1

yeah	0

then	0
we	0
had	1
a	0
number	0
of	0
education	1
reforms	1
that	1
the	1
legislature	1
said	0
hey	1
we	1
got	0
to	0
do	1
this	1
we	0
got	0
to	1
do	0
this	1
we	1
got	0
to	0
do	0
this	1
but	1
they	0
forgot	1
to	1
put	1
in	0
the	0
state	1
budget	1
the	0
money	1
to	1
pay	1
for	0
it	0
and	1
they	0
dumped	1
it	0
all	1
on	0
the	0
local	1
school	1
districts	1
so	0

sounds	1
like	0
the	0
way	0
the	0
federal	1
and	0
state	0
system	0
works	0
[laughter-now]	1

really	0
so	1

yeah	0

so	1
so	0
what	0
ended	0
up	0
happening	0
was	0
was	0
a	0
was	0
a	0
shift	0
we	0
went	0
to	0
sixty	1
five	1
per	0
cent	0
state	1
funding	0
to	1
sixty	0
five	0
per	0
cent	1
local	1
funding	1
in	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0
four	1
years	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
mean	0

uh	0
do	0
you	0
mean	1
a	0
a	0
complete	0
reversal	1
because	0
i	0
guess	0
they	0
can't	1
raise	0
that	0
money	1
in	0
those	1
those	0
poorer	0
districts	1
huh	0

oh	0
complete	0
complete	1
it's	1
all	1
shifted	0
to	0
local	1
districts	1
and	0
now	1
even	0
the	0
money	0
that's	0
been	0
raised	1
for	0
the	0
local	1
districts	0
is	0
being	1
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
siphoned	1
off	0
and	0
sent	1
to	0
other	0
parts	0
of	1
the	0
state	1

that's	0
right	1
and	1
and	0
i	1
have	1
i	0
have	1
no	1
problem	1
with	1
uh	0
a	0
certain	1
uh	0
floor	0
level	1
minimum	1
level	1
that's	0
a	0
standard	1
uh	0
that	0
everybody	1
uh	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
have	1
uh	0

yeah	0

but	1
i	1
am	1
opposed	0
to	1
any	1
attempts	1
to	0
restrict	1
um	0
local	1
communities	0
from	0
taxing	1
themselves	0
above	1
that	0
to	0
provide	1
above	1
the	0
minimum	1

yes	0
i	1
see	1
what	0
you're	0
saying	1
uh	0
i	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
do	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
am	0
a	0
s[trong]	1
uh	0
a	0
strong	1
and	0
staunch	0
supporter	1
of	0
some	1
subsidy	1
for	0
any	1
forms	0
of	0
education	1
i	0
mean	1
by	0
that	1
i	0
mean	1
i'm	0
a	0
product	1
myself	1
i	0
have	1
uh	0
a	0
a	0
a	1
a	0
background	1
of	0
uh	0
being	1
uh	0
getting	0
my	0
college	1
education	1
through	0
the	0
gi	0
bill	1

so	1
did	0
i	1
my	1
master's	0
anyway	1

what	0
but	0
uh	1
when	0
i	0
look	1
at	0
it	0
to	0
me	1
uh	0
it	0
doesn't	1
really	0
make	0
any	0
difference	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
marvelous	1
opportunity	0
that	0
i	1
couldn't	1
have	0
done	1
i	0
don't	1
think	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
gone	0
on	1
unless	0
i	0
had	1
that	1
financial	1
uh	0
easement	1
made	0
possible	1

yeah	0

that's	0
right	0

and	0
i	1
i	0
don't	0
really	0
care	1
what	0
it	0
takes	1
to	0
qualify	1
whether	0
you're	1
uh	0
an	1
an	1
[laughter-whether]	1
[laughter-you're]	0
[laughter-a]	0
[laughter-veteran]	1
or	1
whether	0
you	1
i	0
don't	0
even	0
know	1
if	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
perform	1
community	0
service	1
or	0
unless	1
uh	0
or	1
or	0
you	0
promise	1
to	0
even	1
do	0
something	0
in	0
the	0
future	1
i	1
think	0
that	1
uh	0
the	1
that	0
that	0
the	0
subsidy	1
itself	1
or	1
i	0
guess	1
the	0
enactment	1
of	0
that	0
form	1
of	0
legislation	1
would	1
give	0
many	1
people	0
who	1
i	0
i	1
think	1
i	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
perceive	1
the	0
fact	1
at	0

uh-huh	0

at	0
least	0
what	0
i	0
read	0
is	0
that	0
some	0
younger	1
people	0
feel	0
that	0
education	1
is	0
priced	0
out	0
of	0
their	1
uh	0
out	0
of	0
their	1
uh	0
budget	1
i	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
state	0
of	0
florida	0
just	0
today	0
uh	0
the	0
the	0
legislature	0
uh	0
adjourned	0
and	1
uh	0
they	0
had	0
completed	1
a	0
fifteen	1
per	0
cent	0
increase	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	1
uh	0
state	1
land	0
grant	0
colleges	1
which	1
which	0
isn't	1
i	0
mean	1
to	0
me	1
it	0
doesn't	0
sound	0
like	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
money	1
but	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
would	1
be	0
for	0
fifteen	0
hundred	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
they	0

uh-huh	0

they	0
went	0
from	0
eleven	1
to	0
fifteen	0
hundred	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
for	0
an	0
out	1
of	0
state	1
student	0
the	0
tuition	1
went	0
up	0
twenty	0
five	1
per	0
cent	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
what	0
that	0
would	0
be	1

yeah	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
raise	1
uh	0
community	1
college	0
taxes	0
here	1
a	0
few	0
years	1
ago	1
too	0

but	0
that	1
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
that	0
goes	0
along	1
with	0
the	0
general	0
idea	1
that	0
the	0
federal	1
government	0
had	0
to	1
uh	0
was	0
expending	1
so	1
much	0
money	0
on	0
defense	1
uh	0
that	1
that	1
the	1
program	0
now	1
is	0
a	0
uh	0
program	1
now	1
is	0
uh	0
fees	1
that	1
that	1
fund	1
these	0
things	1
i	0
guess	0
that's	0
trickled	1
down	0
to	0
the	0
states	1
and	1
the	0
states	1
now	0
establish	1
uh	0
don't	0
have	1
enough	0
money	1
so	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
they	1
they	0
must	0
charge	0
fees	1
uh	0
i	0
i	0
i'm	0
not	0
too	0
sure	0
of	0
that	0
reasoning	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	0
guess	1
to	0
get	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
main	1
topic	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
whether	1
i	0
pay	0
too	0
much	0
taxes	1
i	1
i	1
i	0
travel	1
extensively	0
in	0
europe	1
and	0
see	1
enormous	1
uh	0
people	0
p[ay]	1
pay	1
uh	0
a	0
great	0
deal	1
in	0
taxes	1
they	0
tell	0
me	0
when	0
i	0
sit	1
and	0
talk	0
to	0
people	0
there	0
they	0
tell	1
me	0
they	1
they	1
some	0
states	0
they	0
pay	0
uh	0
in	0
germany	1
or	0
in	0
in	0
england	1
in	0
some	1
cases	0
people	1
in	0
my	0
income	0
level	1
at	0
least	1
allege	1
that	0
they	0
pay	1
up	0
to	0
six	1
fifty	1
five	0
percent	0
of	0
their	1
gross	0
income	1
in	0
taxes	1

oh	1
oh	0
i	0
can	1
believe	0
that	1

but	0
but	0
i'm	0
not	1
too	0
sure	1
when	0
i	0
put	0
my	0
property	1
tax	0
in	1
my	0
car	1
tax	1
my	0
income	1
tax	1
and	1
these	0
myriad	1
of	0
uh	0
now	1
it	0
costs	0
me	0
money	1
to	0
leave	0
the	0
country	1
some	0
sort	0
of	0
a	0
tax	1
to	0
leave	0
the	0
country	1
some	0
sort	0
of	0
an	0
airport	1
departure	1
tax	1
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
tax	1
a	0
sales	1
tax	0
which	0
is	0
getting	1
to	0
uh	0
quite	0
high	0
levels	1

yep	0
yeah	0

i'm	0
not	0
sure	1
that	0
i'm	0
not	1
up	1
fairly	1
close	0
to	0
that	1

well	0
i	0
guarantee	1
you	0
you'd	0
be	0
paying	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
in	0
taxes	1
i[f]	1
if	0
uh	0
the	0
democrats	1
had	0
more	0
say	1

you	0
really	0
think	0
so	0

yeah	0
i	0
really	0
do	0

but	0
i	0
mean	0
w[hat]	0
what's	0
what's	0
happened	0
here	0
is	0
is	0
is	0
i	1
feel	0
that	0
that	0
in	0
the	0
last	1
ten	1
years	1
uh	0
my	0
taxes	1
have	0
gone	0
up	1
they	0
haven't	1
gone	0
down	1
i	0
pay	1
uh	0
quite	1
a	0
bit	0
more	0
taxes	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
and	0
and	0

every	0
everybody	0
is	0

but	0
that's	0
been	1
a	0
republican	0
government	1
for	0
the	0
last	0
ten	0
years	1

well	0
what	0
what	0
what	0
they've	1
been	0
able	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
slow	0
down	0
the	0
rate	0
of	0
increase	0
to	0
keep	0
it	0
to	0
keep	0
it	0
b[ecoming]	0
from	0
becoming	0
even	0
more	0
obnoxious	0

well	0
i	0

yeah	0

well	0
this	0
has	0
been	0
really	0
interesting	0
and	0
i've	0
enjoyed	1
our	0
talk	1

okay	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
just	0
push	1
something	0
here	1
push	0
one	0
again	0
right	0

no	0
you	0
just	0
uh	0
we	0
just	0
say	0
say	0
good-bye	0
and	0
that's	0
it	0

just	0
hang	0
up	0
okay	0
don	0

nice	0
talking	0
with	0

i	1
uh	1

name	1
by	1
the	1
way	1

um	1
i'm	1
ann	1

um	0
anyway	1
i	1
uh	1
lot	1
of	1
lot	1
of	1
s[tuff]	1
interesting	1
procedural	1
things	1
i	0
think	1
we	0
could	1
we	1
could	0
change	1
if	1
we're	1
going	1
to	0
talking	1
about	0
the	0

to[night]	0
tonight	1
which	0
is	0
some	1
i	0
guess	0
criminal	1
courts	1
the	1

criminal	1
courts	1
yes	1

yeah	1
the	1
the	0
one	1
of	0
which	1
was	1
uh	1
something	1
something	1
that's	0
been	0
going	1
on	1
because	0
of	0
the	0
rodney	1
king	1
trial	1
here	0
in	0
town	1
and	0
that	1
is	0
uh	0
and	0
that	1
is	0
the	0
exclusion	1
of	0
jurors	1
because	1
of	0
or	0
in	0
spite	1
of	0
their	0
race	1
uh	0
ye[ah]	1

oh	1
really	1

yeah	1
well	1
the	1
the	1
uh	1
the	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
the	0
the	0
the	0
uh	0
the	0
jury	1
that's	0
trying	1
uh	0
the	0
officers	1
in	0
that	1
case	1
is	1
is	1
an	0
all	1
white	1
panel	1

right	1

and	1
there's	1
been	0
a	0
lot	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
local	1
papers	1
of	0
that	0
fact	1

how	0
is	1
it	0

i	0
can't	1
i'm	1
a	0
little	0
surprised	1
they	0
didn't	0
get	1
a	0
change	1
of	0
venue	1
on	0
that	1
one	1

they	0
have	1
they	0
have	1
they	0
moved	1
it	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
county	1
north	1
of	0
here	0

oh	1

um	1
it's	0
in	1
ventura	1
and	1
there's	0
there's	0
still	1
quite	1
a	0
bit	0
of	0
publicity	1
obviously	1
and	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
debatable	1
whether	1
you	0
could	0
get	0
a	0
fair	1
trial	1
almost	0
anywhere	1
because	0
that	1
uh	0
that	1

well	0
that	0
videotape	1
was	0
just	0
horrible	1

yeah	1
it	0
was	1
everywhere	1

yeah	1

so	1
you	1
know	0
and	0
i	1
i	1
think	0
it	0
would	1
be	0
very	1
difficult	1
to	0
find	1
someone	0
uh	0
find	1
a	0
panel	1
that	0
would	1
be	0
not	1
have	1
seen	1
it	0
and	0
and	0
known	1
of	0
what	1
was	0
going	0
on	0

oh	0
i	1
agree	1
with	0
you	1
but	0
i	0
can't	1
imagine	1
that	0
they	0
would	0
do	1
an	0
all	1
white	1
jury	1
without	1
having	0
some	1
sort	1
of	0
of	1
discrimination	1
or	1
or	1
you	0
know	1
uh	0
appeal	1
on	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
jury	1
of	1
his	0
peers	1
and	0
all	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
stuff	1

exactly	1
you	1
know	1
um	1
the	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i'm	1
kind	0
of	0
torn	1
on	0
this	0
issue	1
it's	0
like	1
they're	0
saying	1
well	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	0
they're	0
not	1
he's	1
not	0
getting	1
a	0
jury	1
of	0
his	1
peers	1
which	1
is	0
in	0
some	1
ways	0
i	1
think	0
true	1
but	0
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
is	1
it's	1
also	1
saying	0
that	1
white	1
jurors	1
are	1
not	1
going	0
to	1
are	1
not	1
going	0
to	1
convict	1

right	1

uh	1
you	1
know	0
they're	0
not	1
going	1
to	0
do	0
their	1
job	1
which	1
is	0
the	0
whole	1
the	1
whole	1
point	0
of	0
being	0
on	1
a	1
jury	0
is	1
to	0
convict	1
or	1
or	1
or	0
uh	0
let	1
go	0
based	1
on	0
whether	0
or	0
not	1
the	0
person	1
whether	1
or	0
not	0
the	0
evidence	1
says	1
that	0
there's	0
enough	0

exactly	1

based	1
on	0
fact	1
right	1

how	1
interesting	1
ooh	1
so	1
what's	1
the	0
prevailing	1
thought	1
within	1
the	0
community	1

um	1

i	1
mean	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
the	1
news	1
media's	0
gonna	0
make	1
of	0
it	1
but	1
what	1
about	1
the	0
community	1

they	1
well	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
depends	1
on	0
who	1
you	0
talk	0
to	0
i	1
haven't	0
talked	1
to	0
uh	0
i	0
haven't	1
talked	1
to	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	1
of	0
black	1
people	0
on	0
it	0
but	0
i	0
i	0
rather	1
imagine	1
there's	1
there's	1
some	1
snickering	1
about	1
it	0
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
usually	1
fatalistic	1
oh	0
here	1
we	0
go	0
again	1
folks	1
kind	0
of	1
stuff	1

uh-huh	1

oh	0
my	1
goodness	1
that	1
can't	1
be	0
good	1
for	0
los	1
angeles	1
either	1

no	1
no	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
on	1
on	0
on	1
one	1
hand	1
y[ou]	0
on	0
the	0
one	1
hand	0
you	0
almost	1
hope	1
that	0
they	1
convict	1
them	1
because	1
it's	0
th[ey]	1
they	0
have	1
that	1
very	1
strong	1
piece	1
of	0
physical	1
evidence	1
showing	1
these	1
people	0
beating	1
the	1
heck	1
out	0
of	1
this	1
guy	1
um	0

oh	0
exactly	1

unfortunately	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	0
is	0
not	1
limited	1
to	1
uh	0
a	0
big	0
city	1
like	0
los	0
angeles	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
just	1
about	1
anywhere	1

um-hum	0

is	0
he	1
going	0
to	1
be	0
a	0
g[ood]	0
a	0
good	1
adjudicator	1

i	1
don't	0

i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
this	1
this	0

this	1
got	0
as	0
much	0

but	0
it's	0
rather	1
almost	1

infamous	1
here	1
as	0
it	0
was	1
as	0
it	0
was	1
with	0

had	1
some	1
kind	0
of	1
a	0

over	0
some	0
orange	1

with	1
the	0
with	0
the	0

popped	1
her	0

oh	0

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
well	1
of	0
course	1
the	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
criminal	1
case	0
went	1
up	1
and	0
and	0
the	0
judge	1
gave	0
the	0
woman	1
who	1
shot	1
her	0
shot	1
the	1
girl	1
a	1
uh	0
uh	1
practically	1
a	0
suspended	1
sentence	1
i	1
mean	1
it	1
was	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
she	1

oh	0
my	1
goodness	1

she	1
gave	0
her	0
no	1
time	0
in	0
jail	1
and	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
all	1
of	0
these	0
things	1
and	0
then	0
oh	1
there's	0
uh	0
we	1
have	0
these	0
we	0
have	1
people	1
wandering	1
around	1
to	0
with	1
petitions	1
trying	0
to	0
get	1
the	1
judge	1

to	1
get	1
that	0
judge	1
recalled	1
i	0
would	1
think	1

yeah	1
yeah	1

hm	1
that's	1
almost	1
when	1
you	0
kind	1
of	0
wish	1
that	1
there	1
where	1
st[andardized]	0
standardized	1
sentences	1

yeah	1
it	1
would	0
make	1
it	0
would	0
make	1
life	0
easier	1

it	1
would	1
uh	1

yeah	1
but	1

uh	1
you	1

but	1

you	1
would	0
know	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
would	0
know	1
what	1
you	0
were	0
facing	1
and	0
then	1
it's	1
a	0
matter	1
of	0
of	0
deciding	1
g[uilt]	0

okay	1
this	1
topic	1
is	1
is	1
russia	1
a	1
threat	1
to	1
our	1
security	1
i	1
think	1
they're	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
threat	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
people	1
at	0
this	1
day	0
and	0
time	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
feel	0
about	1
it	1

well	1
they	1
do	1
have	1
uh	1
a	1
major	1
internal	1
problem	1
everybody	1
wants	1
to	1
defect	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
understand	1
why	1
um	1
i	1
think	1
their	1
biggest	1
problem	1
is	1
just	1
you	1
know	1
obtaining	1
food	1
to	0
live	1
so	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
basic	1
needs	1
uh	1
being	1
unmet	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
think	1
globally	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
being	1
a	1
threat	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
world	1

so	0
as	1
soon	1
as	0
they	1
get	1
their	1
their	1
own	1
home	1
country	1
taken	1
care	1
of	1
then	1
they'll	1
consider	1
what	1
they	1
can	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	0
world	1

i	1
believe	1
communism	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
waning	1
it's	1
uh	0
pretty	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
strong	1
hold	1
that	1
they	0
used	1
to	0
have	1
and	1
the	0
russian	1
people	1
are	1
all	1
realizing	1
that	1
the	1
communist	1
system	1
does	1
not	1
work	1
to	1
their	1
satisfaction	1
or	0
their	0
way	1
of	1
surviving	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
their	1
rebellions	1
right	0
now	1
is	0
the	1
result	1
of	0
that	1
i[f]	0
if	1
they	1
can	0
get	1
the	1
army	1
or	1
the	0
military	1
to	0
sway	1
to	0
their	0
side	1
i	1
think	1
that	0
uh	0
it	1
will	1
be	1
on	0
the	1
way	0
out	1
eventually	1

it's	0
just	1
a	0
matter	0
of	1
time	1
because	1
in	0
the	0
baltic	1
states	1
they've	0
already	1
massacred	1
so	0
many	0
people	1
who	0
protested	1
and	1

and	1
that	0
hasn't	1
set	1
too	1
well	1
with	0
their	1
diplomacy	1
for	0
the	1
regarding	1
the	0
uh	0
outcome	1
of	0
their	1
affairs	1
what's	0
your	0
synopsis	1

well	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
do	1
realize	0
that	1
um	1
uh	1
the	1
bush	1
administration	1
isn't	1
too	0
happy	1
with	1
with	0
how	1
they're	1
handling	1
their	0
internal	1
um	0
strife	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	1
diplomacy	1
is	0
concerned	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
been	0
a	1
good	1
a	0
good	1
uh	1
positive	1
direction	1
for	1
um	1
the	1
soviets	1
as	0
far	1
as	1
yeltsin	1
is	0
concerned	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
um	0
allowed	1
to	1
what	0
wh[at]	0
in	0
his	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
congress	1
they	0
they	1
gave	1
him	0
more	0
power	1
as	0
far	1
as	1
his	0
republic	1
in	0
russia	1
is	0
concerned	1
which	0
is	1
gives	1
him	0
more	0
power	1
overall	1
which	0
i	1
think	0
is	1
a	1
good	0
sign	1
that	0
there'll	1
be	0
some	1
you	0
know	1
politically	1
speaking	1
you	1
know	0
he's	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
more	0
power	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
a	0
step	1
in	0
the	0
right	0
direction	1
i	0
think	0
gorbachev	1
realizes	1
that	1
he's	1
got	1
a	1
a	0
major	1
uh	0
uh	0
power	1
figure	1
you	0
know	1
competing	1
against	0
him	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
gonna	0
be	1
pretty	1
close	0
to	0
his	0
demise	1
if	0
he	0
doesn't	1
follow	0
suit	1
with	0
yeltsin	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
uh	0
realizing	1
well	1
he	0
does	1
realize	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
with	0
the	0
fact	1
that	1
they	0
reduced	1
the	1
uh	0
or	0
they	1
increased	1
the	0
prices	1
on	0
their	0
food	1
food	1
and	1
goods	1

uh-huh	1
i	1

uh	0
it	1
yeah	1

i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
went	1
up	1
a	0
thousand	1
percent	1
on	0
most	1

yeah	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	1
incredible	1
but	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
um	0
go	1
in	0
the	0
direction	1
of	0
a	0
market	1
driven	0
economy	1
and	1
and	0
they	0
had	0
to	0
bite	1
the	0
bullet	1
for	0
that	1
so	0
that's	1
a	0
good	0
move	1
on	1
on	0
gorbachev's	1
part	1
in	0
doing	0
that	1

um-hum	1

so	1

but	0
gorbachev	1
has	0
still	1
not	0
fully	0
convinced	1
everyone	1
that	1
he's	1
moving	0
towards	1
a	0
two	1
to	0
three	0
party	1
system	1
of	1
government	1
that	0
nor	1
eliminating	1
or	1
diminishing	1
the	1
communist	0
power	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
where	0
yeltsin	1
steps	0
in	1
so	0
far	1
as	1
his	0
politics	1
of	0
government	1
goes	1
uh	0
but	1
i	0
don't	1
know	1
how	0
convinced	1
the	0
people	1
are	0
of	1
him	1
yet	1
myself	1

well	1
that's	1
all	0
they	0
got	1
right	0
now	1
that's	0
their	0
ray	1
of	0
hope	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
you	0
know	1
they'll	1
go	0
with	1
you	0
know	1
w[ho]	1
whoever	1
comes	0
through	1
for	0
them	1
i	1

i	1
it	1
it's	1
just	0
that	1
w[hat]	0
the	0
weird	1
thing	0
is	1
is	0
that	0
gorbachev	1
is	0
the	0
one	1
that	0
opened	1
the	0
floodgates	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
with	0
glasnost	1
and	0
[poistroi[ka]-/perestroika]	1
perestroika	1
and	0
stuff	1
and	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
he's	0
caught	1
between	1
the	0
old	0
guard	1
and	1
and	1
the	0
new	1
uh	0
glasnost	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
kind	0
of	1
uh	0
escalate	1
to	0
a	0
point	1
where	0
it's	0
out	1
of	0
control	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
had	1
to	0
pull	1
in	0
the	0
reins	1
the	0
only	1
way	0
he	1
knew	0
how	1
in	0
order	1
to	0
keep	1
the	0
peace	1
on	0
peace	1
on	0
both	0
sides	1
so	0
i	0
think	1
that's	0
where	1
you	0
know	1
kind	1
of	0
where	0
he's	0
stuck	1
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1

yeah	1
uh	0
i	1
understand	1
it	1

and	1
that's	0
the	1
that's	0
the	1
situation	1
that	0
he	0
finds	1
himself	0
in	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
he's	1
a	0
tough	0
guy	1
i	0
mean	0
he's	1
been	0
through	1
it	0
so	0
i	0
have	1
no	0
doubt	1
that	0
he'll	1
i	0
mean	1
y[ou]	0
i	1
i	1
think	0
overall	1
he's	1
been	0
a	1
a	0
good	1
ah	0
figure	1
for	1
the	0
the	0
soviet	1
union	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
think	1
his	0
intentions	1
and	0
his	0
ideals	1
are	1
are	1
uh	0
well	1
intentioned	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
in	0
the	0
long-term	1
but	0
i	0
just	1
think	0
that	1
because	0
of	1
the	0
basic	0
needs	1
that	0
the	0
people	1
don't	0
have	1
i	0
think	0
that	1
that	0
makes	1
the	0
problem	1
most	0
severe	1
and	0
makes	1
him	0
look	1
look	0
worse	1
that	0
what	0
his	1
um	0
what	0
his	1
ideals	0
are	1
personally	1

i	0
agree	1
what's	1
bad	1
for	0
the	0
soviet	1
system	1
is	1
that	0
they	0
have	1
the	1
resources	1
to	0
grow	1
and	0
produce	1
their	0
food	1
but	0
somehow	1
it	0
just	1
does	0
not	1
get	0
out	1
to	0
the	0
market	1
the	0
way	1
it	1
should	1

i	0
think	0
it's	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
oh	0
how	1
do	0
you	0
put	0
it	1
bureaucracy	1
and	0
and	0
and	1
uh	0
one	0
thing	1
and	0
then	0
all	1
the	0
corruption	1
i	0
think	0
there's	0
a	1
a	1
a	0
large	1
amount	0
of	0
corruption	1
on	0
the	0
the	0
have	1
and	0
the	0
have	1
nots	1
you	0
know	0
i	1

yeah	1
that's	0
probably	1
more	1
true	1
than	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	0
realize	1

i	1
i	0
know	0
you're	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
that	0
with	0
every	0
society	1
at	0

at	0
least	0
we're	1
more	0
blatant	1
about	0
it	1
but	0
it's	1
very	0
secret	1
and	0
it's	0
been	0
going	0
on	1
for	0
years	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
can't	1
change	1
things	0
overnight	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
but	0
if	0
it	0
gets	1
to	0
a	0
point	1
where	0
people	0
can't	1
survive	1
i	0
mean	1
there's	0
revolution	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
that's	1

it	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
headed	1
in	0
that	0
direction	1
too	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
big	0
time	1
major	1
but	1
you	0
know	0
that's	1
that's	1
what	1
happens	1
when	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
cork	1
blows	1
and	0
you	0
can't	0
handle	1
it	0
anymore	1
i	0
mean	1
that's	1
that's	0
the	1
way	1
the	1
world	1
uh	1
you	0
know	1
revolves	1
that	0
way	1

uh-huh	0
well	0
their	0
knowledge	1
with	1
uh	1
better	1
communication	1
processes	1
in	0
this	1
world	1
now	1
that's	0
reached	1
them	0
is	1
more	1
educated	1
than	0
to	0
the	1
uh	0
ways	1
of	0
the	0
western	1
world	1

i	0
really	1
question	1
though	0
how	0
much	0
technology	1
the	0
average	1
soviet	1
is	0
exposed	1
to	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
was	0
a	0
big	1
stepping	0
stone	1
for	0
them	0
to	1
initiate	1
all	0
their	1
righteous	1
ways	1
of	1
changing	1
things	1
to	1

they	1
probably	1
not	1
enough	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	1
i	1
lot	0
of	1
it's	0
filtered	1
down	0
enough	1
to	0
the	0
common	1
folks	1
that	0
they	1
have	0
gotten	0
wind	1
of	1
what	1
they're	0
missing	1
out	1
on	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
they're	0
starting	1
to	0
realize	1
but	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
don't	0
think	1
they	0
have	1
the	1
resources	1
if	0
you	0
were	1
to	0
compare	1
uh	0
the	0
americans	1
to	0
the	0
soviets	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
home	1
computers	1
are	0
concerned	1
or	0
fact	1
machines	0
fax	1
machines	1
and	0
cellular	1
phones	1
and	0
state	1
of	0
the	0
art	0
equipment	1
that	0
we	1
are	0
so	0
used	1
to	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
they	0
even	1
realize	1
what's	0
out	0
there	1
and	0
to	1
what	0
extent	1

yeah	0
i'm	0
sure	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
them	0
are	0
missing	1
those	1
household	0
items	1

yeah	1
all	1
the	0
major	1
conveniences	1
of	0
life	1

yeah	0
what	0
we	0
consider	1
just	1
i	0
don't	1
[laughter-know]	0
normal	1
everyday	0
things	1
to	0
them	1
is	0
real	1
luxury	0
which	1
is	0
unfortunate	1
for	0
them	1

yeah	0

and	1
of	1
course	0
most	1
of	0
us	1
we	0
don't	0
really	1
appreciate	1
what	1
we've	0
got	1
because	0
we've	0
been	1
so	1
used	1
to	0
it	1

this	1
is	0
true	1
this	0
is	0
very	1
true	1
and	0
we	1
it's	0
human	1
it's	0
human	1
nature	0
though	1
to	1
take	1
things	0
for	0
granted	1
and	0
it	0
kind	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
when	0

when	0
you've	1
lost	1
something	1
or	1
or	0
uh	0
uh	0
don't	0
have	1
what	0
other	0
people	0
have	1
that's	0
when	0
you	0
tend	1
to	0
realize	1
you	0
know	1
what's	1
out	0
there	1
and	0
what	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
you	0
have	1
and	0
what	0
you	0
don't	0
have	1

yeah	0
i	0
agree	1

so	0
the	0
original	1
question	1
do	0
we	0
think	1
they're	0
a	0
threat	1
to	0
our	0
you	0
know	1
a	0
s[ecurity]	1
s[ecurity]	0
security	1
threat	1

yeah	1

um	0
yes	1
and	0
no	1

yeah	1
i	1
can	0
go	1
with	1
that	0
answer	1
too	1
the	0
only	0
yes	1
i	0
could	0
go	1
to	0
is	0
if	1
uh	0
a	0
renegade	1
crew	1
decides	1
to	0
launch	1
an	0
attack	1
or	0
an	0
accidental	1
launching	1
of	0
something	1
to	0
that	0
effect	1
to	1
for	0
to	0
a	0
nuclear	1
exchange	1
but	0
i	0
don't	1
even	0
see	1
that	1
occurring	1
uh	1
because	0
their	1
internal	1
strifes	1
are	0
more	1
important	1
right	1
now	1
than	1
concentrating	1
on	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
outside	1
affairs	1
that	0
they	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
adapted	1
to	0
i	0
guess	1

um	0
no	1

well	0
i	0
don't	1
really	0
feel	1
that	0
the	0
soviets	1
really	0
want	1
to	0
blow	0
up	0
the	0
world	1
i	0
mean	1
um	0
we	1
painted	1
them	0
back	1
in	0
the	0
fifties	1
and	0
sixties	1
as	1
as	1
nonfeeling	1
machine	1
type	0
people	1
and	0
they're	1
people	1
just	0
like	0
us	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	1
up	0
everyday	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	0
put	1
their	0
pants	1
on	0
the	0
same	1
way	1
and	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
eat	1
and	0
everything	0
else	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
don't	0
feel	1
that	1

okay	1
so	1
the	1

all	1
right	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
seen	1

so	1
the	1
latest	1
movie	1
i've	1
seen	1
that	1
i	0
thought	1
was	1
fantastic	1
was	1
dances	1
with	0
wolves	1

that's	1
i	1
knew	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
wanted	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
see	1
that	1

oh	1
man	1

i	1
i	1
just	1
finally	1
ended	1
up	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
uh	1
and	1
one	0
day	1
my	1
husband	1
had	1
the	1
kids	1
and	1
i	1
just	1
went	1
because	1
we	1
couldn't	1
we	1
could	1
never	1
get	1
to	1
go	1
see	1
it	1
together	1
because	1
it's	1
so	1
long	1
by	0
the	0
time	1
we	0
had	0
a	1
babysitter	1
for	1
that	1
[laughter-long]	0

gosh	1

so	1
i	1
finally	1
just	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
just	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
fantastic	1

yeah	1
i	1
i	1
i	1
i	1
watched	1
uh	0
costner	1
on	0
the	0
academy	1
awards	1
i	0
was	0
really	0
happy	0
that	0
he	0
got	0
i	0
was	0
hoping	1
he	0
was	0
going	0
to	1
get	0
best	1
actor	1

yeah	0
yeah	1

uh	0
but	1
he	0
he	1
he	1
did	1
pretty	0
good	1
on	1
that	1
one	0

that	1
was	0
quite	1
a	1
the	0
buffalo	1
scene	0
in	0
that	1
thing	0
was	1
so	1
real	0
it's	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

it's	0
like	1
i	1
mean	1
it	1
just	1
blew	1
me	1
away	1

yeah	0
i'd	0
i	0
bet	0

yeah	0
there	0
several	1
of	1
them	1
that	0
are	0
out	1
right	0
now	1
that	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
see	1
uh	0
dances	0
uh	1
silence	0
of	0
the	1
lambs	1

yeah	1

uh	1
i'm	1
i'm	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	0
see	1
that	1
one	0
that	1
one	1
looks	0
so	1
scary	1
just	1
from	0
the	0
previews	1
i	1

i	1
thought	1
gosh	1
i'd	1
probably	1
have	0
nightmares	1
for	0
the	1
next	1
six	1
months	1

nah	0
nah	0

supposed	1
to	0
be	0

though	1
i	0

nah	0
people	0

i	0
know	1
some	0
friends	1
who	0
went	0
to	0
see	1
it	0

yeah	1

they	1
said	1
it	0
was	1
really	0
riveting	0

yeah	1
well	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
they	0
that's	1
what	0
they	0
said	0
about	0
the	1
exorcist	1
you	1
know	0
no	0
no	0
it's	1
terrible	1

have	1
nightmares	1
you	1
know	1
i	1

me	1
and	1
my	1
roommate	1

read	0
the	1
book	1
before	1
i	0
saw	1
the	0
movie	1

oh	1
uh-huh	0

and	0
the	0
book	0
to	0
