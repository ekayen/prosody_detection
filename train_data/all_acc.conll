much	1
and	0

right	1

and	0

have	0
a	0
boyfriend	1
and	0
like	0

he'll	0
help	1
me	0
do	1
the	0
dishes	1
i	0

up	1
then	0
after	0

right	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
yeah	1

that's	1
right	1
that's	1
right	0

yeah	1
so	1

i've	0
always	1
taught	0
my	0
men	1
that	0
they	0
better	1
clean	0
up	1
with	0
their	0
women	1
and	0
help	1
them	0
if	0
they	0
did	0
that	1
you	1
know	0

right	1

and	0
they're	1
they're	0
good	1
about	0
it	0
but	0
it	0
is	1
neat	0
to	0
see	0
them	0
all	0
work	1
together	0
and	0
a	0
big	1
thing	0
though	0
i	1
see	0
all	1
that	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
women	0
getting	1
married	0
now	1
uh	0
go	0
ba[ck]	0
have	1
gone	0
back	0
to	0
you	0
know	1
they	0

um-hum	0

they	0
they	0
stay	1
at	0
work	1
or	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
work	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
they're	0
well	0
educated	1

um-hum	0

and	1
i	0
believe	1
we'll	0
see	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
CEO's	1
in	0
companies	1
they're	0
having	0
a	0
fit	1
about	0
how	0
little	1
there	0
are	0

oh	0

and	0
i	1
think	0
we'll	0
see	0
a	0
lot	0
more	1
don't	0
you	0
of	1
upper	0
management	1
than	0
we	0
do	0
now	1
even	0

oh	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0

right	1

i	0
think	1
it'll	0
escalate	1

yeah	1

and	0
uh	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
black	1
women	0
now	0
if	0
in	0
fact	0
i	0
work	1
at	0
a	0
high	1
school	0

um-hum	0

and	0
my	0
boss	1
is	0
a	0
black	1
woman	0
and	0
has	0
only	1
been	0
there	0
a	0
couple	0
months	1
and	0
already	0
promoted	1
and	0
she's	0
very	0
sharp	1
and	0
i	1
think	0
that	0
in	0
the	0
ethnic	1
thing	1
will	0
be	1
you	1
know	0
is	1
a	0
good	0
thing	0
now	1

oh	0
me	1
too	1

they're	1
moving	0
them	0
up	1
and	0
they're	0
sharp	1
and	0
they	0
so	0
you're	1
going	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
lo[t]	1
m[ore]	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
of	0
that	0
in	0
leadership	1
i	1
believe	0

yeah	1
i	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
that	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
um	0
really	1
neat	0
to	1
seeing	0
all	0
what	0
educated	1
minority	1
um	0
person	1
who	0
really	1
knows	0
what	0
they're	0
talking	1
about	0
and	0

um-hum	0
right	1

and	0
it's	0
just	0
too	1
bad	0
that	0
some	1
people	0
you	1
know	0
still	1
look	0
down	1
on	0
them_1	0
just	1
because	0
of	0
their	0
color	1
you	1
know	0
especially	1

right	1
that's	1
a	0
shame	0

especially	1
black	0
women	1

yes	1

so	1

yeah	0
but	0
they	1
wouldn't	0
know	1
what	0
they're	0
doing	1

right	1

but	0
i'm	1
not	0
big	1
on	0
subserving	1
as	0
[laughter-far]	1
[laughter-as]	0
to	0
the	0
men	1
at	0
all	1

um-hum	0

right	1

but	0
i	0
never	1
have	1
gone	0
along	0
with	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
even	1
far	1
back	0
but	0
i	1
was	0
brought	0
up	1
pretty	0
good	1
in	0
a	0
home	1
that	0
years	0
ago	1
my	0
mother	0
was	0
that	1
way	0
the	0
same	1
my	0
b[oys]	0
the	0
our	1
you	1
know	0
some	1
people	0
say	0
oh	0
the	0
boys	1
shouldn't	0
have	0
to	0
do	1
those	0
jobs	0
the	0
inside	1
jobs	1
but	0
we	1
never	0
were	0
taught	1
they	0
had	1
to	0
do	0
as	0
much	0
as	0
we	1
did	0
so	0
that	1
was	0
good	0

right	1
same	1
here	0
yeah	1

so	0
that's	1
i	1
think	0
that's	0
good	1
to	0
keep	1
the	0
equal	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
as	0
uh	0
not	0
nece[ssarily]	0
nec[essarily]	1
uh	0
necessarily	1
by	0
sex	1
type	0
thing	1
you	0
know	1

right	1
same	1
here	0

you	0
should	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
accomplish	1
as	0
much	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
the	0
uh	0
attitude	1
is	0
a	0
lot	1
better	0
towards	0
the	0
parents	1
raising	1
the	0
younger	0
ones	0
now	0

um-hum	0

you	0
see	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
of	1
the	0
mothers	1
and	0
all	0
saying	1
to	0
the	0
young	1
girls	0
you	1
know	0
you	1
can	0
do	0
it	0

yeah	1

if	0
he	1
can	0
do	0
it	0
you	1
can	0
do	0
it	0
type	0
thing	1

yeah	1

exactly	1
i	0
i	1
see	0
more	0
men	1
um	0
like	0
participating	1
in	0
like	0
the	0
family	1
things	0
with	0
children	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
helping	1
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
them_1	0
more	0
and	0
and	0
um	0
um	0
doing	1
the	0
jobs	0
equally	1
yeah	1
oh	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

right	1
what	1
about	0
politics	1
on	1
it	0

oh	0

do	0
you	0
think	1
the	0
political	1
scene	1

i'm	1
not	0
that	0
big	1
on	0
politics	1
i'm	0
not	1
that	0
educated	1
on	0
it	0
i'm	0

yeah	1

i'm	0

i'm	1
real	0
di[sgusted]	0
i'm	0
kind	1
of	0
disgusted	1
this	0
year	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
see	1
many	0
women	0
into	1
the	0
political	1
scene	0
and	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
we	0
should	1
have	0
more	0
political	1
leaders	1
in	0
the	0
women	1
than	0
we	0
do	1
up	0
for	0
and	0
even	0
for	0
president	1
and	0
vice	1
president	0
this	1
year	0
there's	0

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
that	1

there's	0
nobody	1
again	0
i	0
think	1
they're	0
all	1
scared	0
out	1
after	0
[laughter-tha[t]-]	0
after	1
um	0
oh	0
what	1
was	0
the	0
lady's	0
name	1
that	0
ran	1
a	0
couple	0
of	0
Fitz[gerald]	1
i	1
forget	0
her	0
name	0
now	0

oh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0

but	0
you	0
know	1
who	0
i	0
mean	1

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
who	0
you're	0
talking	0
about	0

yeah	1
she	0
took	0
such	1
a	1
rough	0
go	1
of	0
it	0
and	0
they	0
ta[x]	0
their	0
tax	1
deal	1
and	0

yeah	1
at	0
least	1
she	0
was	0
strong	1
enough	0
to	0
like	0
try	1
it	0
and	0
you	1
know	0

right	1
right	1
but	0

so	0
that's	1
good	1

but	0
i	0
wish	1
they	0
would	0
get	1
some	0
more	1
on	0
tha[t]	0
i	0
really	1
was	0
disappointed	1
this	0
year	0
when	0
i	1
see	0
any	1
of	0
the	0
candidates	0
talking	1
that	0
they're	0
talking	1
about	0
um	0
they	1
i	1
didn't	0
see	0
any	1
of	0
the	0
women	1
in	0
there	0

um-hum	0

and	0
that	1
disappoints	1
me	0

oh	0

and	0
right	0
now	1
i	0
don't	0
think	0
we	0
have	1
too	0
many	0
tha[t]	0
uh	0
in	0
the	0
forefront	1
Schroeder's	1
about	0
the	0
biggest	1
one	0
in	0
Washington	1

um-hum	0

congress	1
woman	1
and	0
um	0
other	1
tha[n]	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
we	1
really	1

well	1
what	1
would	0
you	1
have	0
at	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	1

well	1
uh	0
lately	1
since	0
i	0
have	1
children	1
i've	1
cut	0
down	1
on	0
having	1
dinner	0
parties	1
but	1

uh-huh	1

but	1
when	1
i	0
do	1
i	0
try	1
to	0
keep	1
it	0
pretty	1
simple	1
on	0
things	1
that	0
i	0
can	0
prepare	1
ahead	1
of	0
time	1
uh	0
i	1
have	0
one	1
recipe	0
for	0
uh	0
a	0
really	1
good	1
um	0
type	1
of	0
a	0
meatball	1
it's	0
called	0
burgundy	1
meatballs	1
and	0
it's	0
made	1
with	0
r[ed]	0
red	1
wine	1
and	0
um	0

oh	1
gosh	1
that	1
sounds	0
great	1

um	0

it's	0
it's	0
really	1
good	0
and	0
you	0
can	0
make	1
it	0
ahead	1
of	0
time	1
and	0
then	1
um	0
make	0
the	0
sauce	1
when	1
you're	0
ready	1
to	1
um	0
to	0
serve	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

that's	1
one	0
of	0
my	1
favorite	0
things	1
to	0
to	0
serve	1

well	1
um	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
would	0
probably	1
depend	1
on	0
whether	0
this	0
was	0
a	0
formal	1
or	0
informal	1
dinner	1
party	1

sure	1

but	1
if	1
it	0
was	0
informal	1
my	1
first	0
choice	0
would	0
be	0
crawfish	1

oh	0
really	1
well	1
i	0
guess	1
being	0
from	1
that	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1

because	1
i	1
mean	0
crawfish	1
everybody	1
over	0
here	0
likes	0
crawfish	1
but	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
have	0
to	0
worry	1
about	0
satisfying	1
my	1
guest	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
if	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
formal	1
uh	0
dinner	0
party	1
i	0
would	0
probably	1
think	0
of	0
something	1
else	1
like	0
um	0
shrimp	1
shrimp	1
fettucini	1
is	0
real	0
easy	1
to	0
um	0
make	1
and	0
everything	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
it's	1
usually	0
well	0
liked	1
by	0
people	1
i	0
guess	0
i'm	1
just	0
a	0
seafood	1
fan	1
so	0
i	0
think	1
on	0
the	0
lines	1
oh	1

well	1
how	0
do	1
you	0
make	1
how	1
do	1
you	0
you	0
cook	1
crawfish	1
i	0

i	0
in	1
fact	1
i	1
just	0
came	1
back	1
from	0
the	0
grocery	1
store	1
and	1
being	1
in	0
Texas	1
we	0
don't	1
have	0
too	1
many	0
you	1
know	0
people	1
that	1
that	1
eat	1
crawfish	1
but	1
they	1
had	0
live	1
crawfish	1
on	0
sale	1

oh	1
yeah	1
um	0

um	0
you're	0
not	1
supposed	1
to	0
i	0
mean	1
you're	0
not	1
supposed	0
to	0
eat	1
them_1	0
dead	1
i	0
mean	1
well	0
you	0
eat	1
them_1	0
dead	1
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0

don't	1
buy	1
them_1	0
that	0
way	1

right	1
because_1	1
if	0
if	0
they're	0
dead	1
for	0
too	0
long	1
you	0
can	0
always	1
tell	1
whenever	0
they're	0
cooked	1
if	0
they've	0
been	0
dead	1
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
because_1	0
their	0
tail	1
straightens	0
out	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
you're	0
not	1
supposed	0
to	0
eat	1
those	0
because_1	0
they're	0
the	0
bad	1
for	0
you	0

okay	1
well	1
i'll	0
remember	1
that	0

yeah	1
so	0
if	0
you	0
ever	0
go	0
in	0
a	0
restaurant	1
and	0
order	1
crawfish	1
i	0
mean	1
every	0
once	1
in	0
a	0
while	1
you'll	0
see	1
o[ne]	0
i	0
mean	1
it	0
doesn't	1
happen	0
very	0
often	1
because	0
it's	0
just	0
an	0
accident	1
but	0
if	0
the	0
tail	1
is	0
straight	1
on	0
it	0
then	0
yeah	1
don't	0
eat	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
um	0
you	0
just	1
put	1
some	0
cajun	1
well	0
lots	1
of	0
pepper	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
you	0
just	0
boil	1
them	0
and	0
they're	0
absolutely	1
wonderful	1
but	0
there's	1
uh	0
they're	0
a	0
pain	1
to	0
peel	1
for	0
some	1
people	0
once	1
you	0
get	0
used	1
to	0
it	0
they're	0
real	0
easy	1
but	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	1
have	0
nails	1
or	0
anything	0
you	0
can	1
plan	1
on	0
those	0
being	0
shot	1

when	0
you	0
were	1
um	0
whe[n]	1
when	0
you	1
serve	1
it	0
do	0
you	1
shell	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
serve	0
them	0
to	1

i	0
think	1
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	1
i	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
it	0
depends	1

um-hum	1

like	1
if	0
like	1
my	1
age	0
if	0
there	1
was	0
a	0
bunch	0
of	0
college	1
kids	1
coming	1
over	0
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	0
no	0
i	1
they	0
would	0
shell	1
their	0
own	1
you	1

sure	1

you	1
know	0
we'd	1
just	0
have	0
crawfish	1
and	0
beer	1
or	0
something	1
but	1
um	0
if	1
it	0
was	0
more	0
formal	1
like	1
if	0
i	0
was	0
you	0
know	1
working	1
environment	1
then	0
i	0
would	0
probably	1
um	0
sh[ell]	0
shell	1
them_1	0
or	0
at	0
least	1
disconnect	1
them	0
from	0
the	0
head	1
but	0
there's	1
a	0
there's	0
a	0
big	0
thing	1
over	0
here	1
that	0
everybody	1
sucks	0
the	0
head	1

so	0
they	1
don't	0
have	0
see	1
that	0
ooh	1

so	1
um	0
it	0
it	0
would	1
just	0
depend	1
that's	1

that's	1
the	0
best	0
part	1
of	0
the	0
crawfish	1

sucking	1
the	0
head	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
i[t]	0
it	0
just	0
depended	1
on	0
what	0
type	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
guess	1
but	0
you	1
can	0
buy	1
uh	0
the	0
crawfish	1
tails	1
already	0
peeled	1
an[d]	0
everything	1
and	0
usually	1
you	0
use	0
those	1
like	1
for	0
frying	1
or	1
to	0
put	1
in	0
salads	1
or	1
to	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
make	0
a	0
sauce	1
with	0
or	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0
you	1
can	0
go	0
ahead	0
and	0
buy	1
them_1	0
cooked	1
and	0
shelled	1
and	0
they're	1
more	0
expensive	1
of	0
course	1
but	1

does	1
it	0
taste	1
a	0
lot	1
like	0
shrimp	1

um	0
yeah	1
it	0
really	0
does	1
i	0
like	1
shrimp	0
better	1

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

just	1
um	0
but	0
crawfish	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
just	0
has	0
a	0
taste	1
of	0
its	0
own	1
it	0
also	1
depends	1
on	0
who's	1
cooking	1
it	0
and	0
how	0
much	0
seasoning	1
they	0
use	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	1
that	0
but	0

sure	1

but	0
um	0
i	1
think	0
that	1
and	0
also	1
to	0
get	1
totally	1
off	0
c[rawfish]	0
the	0
subject	1
of	0
crawfish	1
lots	1
of	0
vegetables	1
and	0
hors	0
d'oeuvres	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
that	0
really	0
helps	1

have	0
a	0
a	0
friend	1
another	0
couple	0
where	1
the	0
husband	1
is	0
the	0
one	0
who	0
cooks	1
all	1
the	0
time	1

and	1

that's	0
what	0
i	1
need	1

yeah	1
that's	0
what	0
i	1
wish	0
i	0
had	1
but	1
in	0
our	0
family	1
i'm	0
the	0
one	0
who	1
who	0
cooks	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
it's	0
gotten	1
a	0
little	0
more	0
difficult	1
with	0
kids	1
but	0
i	0
really	1
do	0
enjoy	0
cooking	1
and	0
we	1
um	0
we	1
have	0
them	0
over	1
for	0
dinner	1
back	1

i	0
had	1
my	0
second	1
child	1
we	0
sort	0
of	0
had	0
a	0
contest	1
going	0
where	1
you	0
know	0
he	1
would	0
cook	1
and	0
then	0
the	0
next	1
time	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
my	1
turn	1
and	0
i'd	0
try	0
to	0
outdo	1
him	1
and	0
then	0
he'd	0
try	1
to	0
outdo	0
me	1
and	0

really	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
and	0

i	0
bet	0
that	1

and	0

that	1
that	0
got	0
pretty	1
competitive	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
who	1
could	0
come	0
up	0
with	0
the	0
best	1
recipe	1

yeah	1
it	0

it	0
did	1
and	0

we	0
we	1
tried	1
to	0
be	1
fancier	1
or	0
more	0
courses	1
than	0
the	0
other	1
or	1

that	1
would	0
be	0
fun	1

or	1

was	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
fun	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
something	0
unique	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
then	0
we	0
got	1
into	0
different	1
um	0
themes	1
you	0
know	0
um	0
whether	1
it	0
would	0
be	1
ethnic	1
food	1
or	1
um	0
sometimes	1
it	0
would	0
be	1
um	0
oh	1
oh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
maybe	0
an	0
outdoor	1
theme	1
or	1
uh	0
uh	0
elegant	1
theme	0
or	0
you	0
know	1

uh	0
huh	1

it	1
was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1

sometimes	1
it	0
might	0
be	0
the	0
candlelight	1
and	0
sometimes	1
it	0
might	0
be	0
the	0
picnic	1
out	0
back	0
or	0
something	1

that's	0
right	1

well	0

us	1
dinner	1
one	1
time	0
uh	0
just	1
to	0
even	1

seemed	0
to	0
be	1
unfairly	1
doing	0
all	0
the	0
cooking	1
and	0
they	1
were	0
doing	0
all	0
the	0
enjoying	1

does	1
except	0
that	1
knowing	1
them	0
they	0
would	0
probably	1
do	0
something	1
ridiculous	1
and	0
terrible	1
just	0
just	0
to	1
uh	0
make	1
sure	0
that	0
they	0
didn't	1
have	0
to	0
do	1

them	0
and	0
i	0
don't	1
i'm	0
sure	1
she	0
puts	0
wine	1
in	0
it	0
because	1
um	0
she	0
cooks	1
everything	0
with	0
alcohol	1
but	0

um	0

i	0
don't	1
know	0
i	0
would	1
i	0
would	1
be	0
interested	1
in	0
getting	0
that	0
recipe	1
for	0
you	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
it	0
around	1

yeah	1
it's	0
um	0
it's	0
in	1
the	0
other	0
room	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
we	0
have	0
enough	1
time	1
for	0
it	0
it's	0

oh	1

it's	0
real	1
easy	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
unique	1
things	1
in	0
this	0
like	0
a	0
pound	1
of	0
ground	0
beef	1
some	0
bread	0
crumbs	1
um	0
an	0
egg	1
um	0
um	0
what	1
ever	0
seasoning	1
usually	0
just	0
light	1
seasonings	1

yeah	1

seasonings	1
like	0
salt	1
and	0
pepper	1
um	0
and	0
chopped	1
up	0
water	1
chestnuts	1
which	0
is	0
something	1
different	1
um	0

oh	1

that	0
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1

makes	1
them	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
crunchy	1
you	0
need	1
to	0
chop	0
them_1	0
up	0
real	0
fine	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
it	0
makes	1
them	0
crunchy	1
and	0
that	0
adds	0
something	1
new	0
to	0
it	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
sauce	1
is	0
just	0
made	1
with	0
um	0
bouillon	1
cubes	1
water	1
burgundy	1
wine	1
and	1
um	0
cornstarch	1
instead	0
of	0
flour	1

um-hum	1

oh	1

so	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
thick	1
rich	1
type	0
of	0
a	0
sauce	1
it's	0
more	1
of	0
a	1
when	0
you	0
use	0
corn	1
starch	1
in	0
in	0
gravy	1
like	0
you	1
know	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
um	0
Chinese	1
food	0
the	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
gravy	1
or	0
a	0
sauce	1
that	0
comes	0
with	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
they	0
use	0
corn	1
starch	0
instead	1
of	0
flour	1
in	0
all	1
of	0
their	0
sauces	1
and	0
gravies	1

um-hum	1

and	0
it	0
gives	1
it	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
different	1
consistency	1

well	0
um	0
how	0
long	1
do	0
you	1
cook	1
the	0
meatballs	1

the	0
meatballs	1
you	0
just	1
um	0
after	0
you	1
form	1
them	0
fry	1
them	0
in	0
a	0
pan	1
until	1
they're	1
uh	0
browned	1
on	0
all	1
all	0
sides	1
and	0

uh	0
huh	1

and	0
then	0
drain	1
off	0
all	0
the	0
grease	1
uh	0
then	1
what	0
i	0
usually	1
do	0
is	0
i	0
freeze	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you're	0
ready	1
to	0
serve	1
them	0
then	0
you	0
cook	1
the	0
sauce	1
and	0
then	0
put	0
the	0
meatballs	1
into	1
the	0
sauce	0
and	0
heat	1
it	0
probably	1

oh	1

yeah	1

you	0
have	0
to	0
heat	1
it	0
up	0
for	0
a	0
good	1
oh	1
if	0
they're	0
frozen	1
you	0
know	0
it	0
may	0

half	0
hour	1
for	0
them	0
to	0
thaw	1
out	0
but	0

heat	1
them	0
thoroughly	1
in	1
the	0
sauce	0
itself	1
let	0
them	1
simmer	1

but	0
i	0
do	1
live	0
in	0
the	0
better	1
and	0
well	1
in	0
the	0
best	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
city	1
though	0
i	0
live	1
in	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
real	1
richy	1
part	0
i	0
guess	1
i'm	1
not	0
but	0

but	0
everybody	0
around	1
me	0
is	1
and	1
um	0
but	1
the	0
i	0
have	0
friends	1
that	0
live	1
in	0
the	0
other	1
the	0
less	1
fortunate	1
or	0
whatever	0
you	0
wanna	0
call	1
it	0
part	0
of	0
town	1
and	0
their	1
schools	1
are	0
kind	0
of	0
rundown	1
and	0
um	0
older	1
and	0
they	1
don't	0
really	1
offer	1
as	0
much	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
as	0
uh	0
the	0
school	0
that	0
my	1
girls	0
are	0
in	1
i	0
don't	1
really	0
think	0
that's	1
fair	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

um	0
but	1
you	0
know	0
i'm	0
happy	1
with	0
what	1
they're	0
in	1
so	0
go	0
ahead	1

well	1
yeah	1
it	0
it's	0
it's	0
pretty	1
much	0
what	0
i	1
was	0
going	0
to	0
say	0
is	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
disparity	1
between	0
different	0
neighborhoods	1
and	0
what	0
sort	1
of	0
schools	1
go	0
in	1

um-hum	0

um	0
i	1
grew	0
up	0
in	0
New	0
York	1
and	1
um	0
the	0
place	1
or	0

wow	1

or	0
not	1
New	0
York	0
City	0
upstate	1
New	0
York	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	1
went	0
to	0
uh	0
the	0
City	1
of	0
Rochester	1
School	1
District	0

um-hum	0

and	1
s[o]	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
my	0
friends	1
were	0
in	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
neighboring	1
suburbs	1
and	0
it	0
wasn't	1
we	0
weren't	1
too	1
far	0
removed	1
geographically	1
from	0
each	0
other	1
but	0
the	0
difference	1
in	0
schools	1
i	0
think	0
was	0
pretty	0
substantial	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
that	0
probably	1
would	0
have	0
been	0
better	1
if	0
is	0
if	0
the	0
entire	1
county	1
had	0
had	0
had	0
just	0
one	0
school	1
system	0

right	1

and	0
that	1
would	0
result	1
in	0
some	0
um	0
could	1
result	0
in	0
more	0
equitable	1
distribution	0
of	0
money	1
because	0
what	0
was	0
happening	1
was	0
you	1
know	0
all	0
the	0
very	0
rich	1
people	0
went	0
out	1
to	0
the	1
move	1
out	0
to	0
the	1
suburbs	1
and	0
the	0
city	1
had	1
a	0
very	1
low	0
tax	1
base	0
so	1
they	0
didn't	1
have	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
money	1
to	0
work	0
with	0

uh-huh	0

as	1
a	0
result	0
the	0
schools	1
were	0
rundown	1
there	0
wasn't	1
as	0
many	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
nice	1
supplies	1
in	0
science	1
class	1
that	0
we	0
would	0
have	1
liked	1
there	0
wasn't	1
as	0
many	1
advanced	0
placement	1
courses	1
uh	0
when	0
i	0
was	0
a	0
senior	1
as	0
some	1
other	0
schools	0
had	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
it	0
it	0
so	1
i	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
ways	1
to	0
to	0
to	0
help	1
schools	0
in	0
general	1
uh	0
and	0
get	1
them	0
all	1
to	0
a	0
minimum	0
level	1
of	0
of	0
of	0
competency	1
almost	1
would	0
be	1
to	0
expand	1
the	0
size	1
of	0
school	1
districts	0
so	0
you	0
get	0
a	0
wider	1
variety	1
of	0
people	1
and	0
the	0
the	0
problem	1
with	0
that	0
is	0
then	0
then	1
then	0
people	1
will	0
either	1
the	0
rich	1
people	0
will	0
either	0
pull	1
their	0
kids	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
public	1
school	0
and	0
put	0
them	0
in	0
private	1
schools	0
or	1
they'll	0
move	1
farther	1
away	1
to	1
get	0
better	0
schools	1
so	1

yeah	1

[laughter-right]	1

so	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
you	1
end	0
up	0
chasing	1
like	0
a	0
dog	1
chasing	0
its	0
own	0
tail	1
sort	0
of	0

also	1
um	0
the	0
the	0
family	1
environment	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
can	0
come	1
to	0
south	0
Tyler	1
where	0
i	0
live	1
and	0
you	1
have	0
got	0
room	1

with	0

willing	1
to	0
go	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
find	1
out	0
what	1
they're	0
learning	1
and	1
if	1
they're	1
learning	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
really	1
don't	0
have	1
much	1
of	0
a	1
chance	1
at	0
all	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

why	1
is	1
that	0

[laughter-you]	0
you	1

j[ust]	0
they	0

up	0
there	0
at	0
my	0
kid's	0
school	1
i	0

i	0
i	0
know	1
kids	1
that	0
their	0
parents	1
could	0
really	0
give	0
a	0
rip	1
and	0
the	0
kids	1
are	0
not	0
motivated	0

right	0

right	0

they	0
have	0
no	1
motivation	0
from	0
home	1
so	0
they	1
just	0
go	0
to	0
school	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
eh	0
you	0
know	1
i'll	0
get	0
through	0
the	0
day	1
and	0
um	0
bring	0
homework	1
home	1
and	0
there's	1
nobody	0
to	0
to	0
sit	0
them	0
down	1
and	0
say	0
you're	1
going	0
to	0
do	1
this	0

right	0

um	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
they	0
they	0
take	1
a	0
notion	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
they	0
do	1
and	0
um	0
that	1
doesn't	0
work	0
either	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
guidance	1
and	0
um	0
they	0
can't	1
just	0
have	1
it	0
at	0
school	1
and	0
then	0
come	0
home	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
there's	0
nothing	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
i	0
know	1
that	0
that	0
that	0
was	1
a	0
big	0
factor	1
for	0
me	0
i	0
ended	1
up	0
coming	0
out	1
of	0
of	0
the	0
public	0
school	1
system	0
very	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
with	0
very	1
good	0
education	1
i	0
ended	1

uh-huh	0

ended	1
up	0
getting	0
some	0
scholarships	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
college	1
and	0
which	0
has	0
been	1
you	1
know	0
which	0
is	0
really	1
nice	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
difference	1
for	0
me	1
was	1
that	0
my	0
parents	1
were	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
were	0
definitely	1
they	0
were	0
always	1
there	0
was	0

yeah	1

was	0
like	0
well	0
yeah	1
of	0
course	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
study	1
and	0
do	0
well	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	0
the	0
way	1
of	0
course	1
are	0
you	0
know	0

well	1
Michael	1
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0
about	0
um	0
funding	1
for	0
AIDS	0
research	1
do	0
you	0

well	1
um	1
uh	1
that's	0
something	1
i've	1
never	1
thought	1
a	0
lot	1
about	1

um-hum	0

um	1
i've	0
i	1
work	1
in	1
a	0
hospital	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
i've	1
worked	1
in	1
the	0
hospital	1
for	1
about	0
fifteen	1
years	1
and	0
i've	1
taken	1
care	1
of	0
a	1
few	1
AIDS	1
patients	0

uh-huh	0

um	1
when	0
they	0
asked	1
us	0
did	1
did	1
we	0
want	1
to	0
um	0
keep	1
it	0
the	0
same	1
or	0
uh	0
spend	1
more	0
or	0
spend	1
less	1
i	1
think	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
right	0
now	1
w[hat]	0
what	0
they're	0
spending	1
is	0
adequate	1
uh	0
my	0
for	0
my	0
personal	1
opinion	1
um	0
because_1	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
something	1
that's	0
gonna	0
take	1
them_1	0
a	0
while	1
to	0
come	0
up	1
with	0
a	0
uh	0
vaccine	1
for	1
i	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
don't	0
think	1
it's	0
gonna	0
be	0
that	0
easy	0
to	0
come	0
up	1
with	0
or	0

yeah	0

or	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
already	0
would	1
have	0
by	0
now	1
you	0
know	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
um	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
if	0
spending	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
money	1
would	0
really	1
make	0
any	0
difference	1
right	0
now	0
i	0
think	1
they're	0
doing	1
the	0
is	0
as	0
much	1
research	1
as	0
they	0
can	0
possibly	1
do	1
you	0
know	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
what	0
about	0
you	1

well	1
i	0
guess	1
i'm	0
not	1
too	1
aware	1
of	0
how	1
much	0
they're	0
spending	1
right	0
[laughter-now]	0
you	0
know	1

i'm	1
not	0
either	1
i'm	0

i'm	0
definitely	1
not	0
aware	1
of	0
how	0
much	1

yeah	1

uh	0
it's	0
something	0
i've	0
never	1
really	0
kept	0
up	1
with	0
at	0
all	1

uh-huh	0
yeah	0

um	0
i	0
don't	0
kn[ow]	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
uh	0
i	0

i	1
mean	0
i	0
go	0
ahead	1
um-hum	0

i	0
know	1
uh	0
i've	1
always	0
thought	1
more	0
about	0
the	0
disease	1
rather	0
than	0
the	0
research	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
i	0
mean	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

and	0
uh	0
that	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	1
um	0
if	0
if	0
we	0
were	0
talking	1
about	0
the	0
money	1
um	0
i'd	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
say	1
what	1
they're	0
spending	1
is	0
probably	0
enough	1
simply	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
much	0
about	1
it	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	0
can	0
see	1
that	0
research	1
is	0
needed	1
and	0
you	1
know	0

oh	0
yeah	1

definitely	1

i	0
think	0
so	1
i	0
think	0
so	1

i	0
mean	0
it's	0
becoming	1
a	0
major	0
problem	1

yeah	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
guess	0
the	0
area	0
that	0
i	1
think	0
more	0
about	1
is	0
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	1
them	0
focus	1
on	0
uh	0
preventing	1
it	0
uh	0
in	0
more	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

well	0
that's	0
true	1
that's	0
true	1
because	0
um	0
it's	0
a	0
such	1
an	0
easily	0
preventable	1
disease	0

right	1
and	0
i	0
i	1
feel	0
like	0
just	0
saying	1
uh	0
safe	1
sex	0
is	0
not	1
the	0
answer	1
it's	0

um	0

it's	0
it's	0
uh	0
abstinence	1
in	0
certain	0
cases	1

sort	0
of	0
scary	1
to	0
find	0
yourself	0
single	1
again	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
because	0
you	0
never	1
know	0
what's	0
gonna	0

don't	0
know	0
who	1
you're	0
gonna	0

wanting	0
to	0
go	1
and	0
have	0
sex	1
with	0
[laughter-everybody]	0
i	0
see	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
it's	0
something	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
think	1
about	0
these	0
days	1

yeah	1

a	0
single	0
person	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
certainly	1
changed	0
my	1
attitude	1
about	0
that	1
in	0
a	0
hurry	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

and	0
um	0

i	1
think	0
for	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
it	0
has	1

certainly	1

so	1

yeah	1

so	0

but	0
um	0
uh	0
i	0
know	1
that	0
uh	0
in	0
some	0
of	1
these	0
larger	1
cities	1
they're	0
passing	1
out	0
free	1
syringes	1
and	0
all	0
of	0
that	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	0
to	0
prevent	1
you	1
know	0
so	0
that	0
uh	0
the	0
drug	1
addicts	0
won't	0
be	0
getting	0
dirty	0
needles	1
and	0
everything	1

uh-huh	0

drug	1
addicts	0

um-hum	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
that's	1
a	0
bad	0
idea	1

uh-huh	0

i	0
know	1
it	0
uh	0
sort	0
of	0
doesn't	1
address	0
the	0
problem	1
of	0
drug	1
addiction	0

yeah	1

it	0
just	0
sort	0
of	0
keeps	0
that	1
going	0

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
at	0
least	1
drug	1
addiction	0
can	0
be	0
treated	1
whereas	0
AIDS	1
so	0
far	1
cannot	1
be	0
you	0
know	0
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
that's	1
i'm	1
not	0
t[oo]	0
too	0
much	0
against	1
the	0
the	0
passing	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
free	1
syringes	1
myself	1

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0
about	0
that	1

well	1
yeah	1
boy	1
th[at's]	0
that's	1
a	0
hard	1
issue	1

it's	0
it	0
really	1
is	1
it	0

it	0
really	1
is	0

it	0
really	1
is	0
they	0
gave	1
us	0
a	0
hard	0
topic	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	1
i	0
i	0
definitely	1
think	1
that	0
it's	0
the	0
drug	1
problem	0
that	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
addressed	1
but	0
as	1
you	0
say	1
um	0
people	1
i	1
mean	0
in	0
the	0
meantime	1
well	1
someone	1
who's	0
not	1
ready	0
to	0
give	0
up	0
drugs	1
um	0
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

that's	0
true	1

that's	0
true	1

if	0
they're	0
per[petrating]	1
perpetrating	1
the	0
AIDS	1
problem	1
passing	1
that	1
on	0
to	0
each	0
other	1
then	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
consider	1
the	0
two	1
problems	1
drug	1
addiction	0
an	0
AIDS	1
AIDS	1
would	0
have	0
to	0
have	0
come	0
first	1
i	0
guess	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
something	1
to	0
uh	0
to	0
do	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	0

so	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
um	0
course	0
there's	1
so	1
many	0
things	1
in	0
the	0
world	1
where	0
if	0
you	0
solve	1
one	1
problem	0
you	0
may	1
be	0
creating	0
another	1
you	0
know	1

[laughter-yeah]	0

and	0
uh	0
so	0
i	0
guess	1
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
two	0
problems	1
and	0
see	0
which	0
is	0
worse	1
and	0
which	0
is	0
the	0
most	1
important	0
to	0
solve	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
don't	0
know	1

yeah	1

but	0
um	0
but	0
i've	0
never	1
looked	0
into	0
how	0
much	0
money	1
they're	0
spending	0
i	0
have	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
our	0
tax	1
money	0
goes	1
to	0
that	0

yeah	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
really	0
have	0
never	1
looked	0
into	0
it	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1

yeah	0
i	0
haven't	1
either	1
i've	0
heard	1
you	1
know	0
uh	0
different	1
voices	1
speaking	0
up	1
and	0
saying	1
we're	1
not	0
spending	0
enough	1
and	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

and	0
mostly	1
that's	0
what	0
i've	0
heard	1
so	0

right	1
sure	1

so	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0

yeah	1

and	0
yet	0
i	0
know	1
it's	0
um	0
it	0
sounds	1
like	0
big	0
money	0
to	0
me	1

yeah	1
i	0

but	1
it	0
probably	1
takes	1
a	0
lot	0

i	0
think	0
it	0
is	1
i	0

i	0
think	0
it	0
is	1

yeah	1
it	0
does	1
every	0
it	0

so	0

it	0
seems	1
to	0
take	0
more	0
than	0
uh	0
for	0
any	1
little	0
thing	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
seems	0
to	0
take	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
money	1
that	0
you	0
would	0
think	0
it	0
would	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	0

you	1
have	0
any	0
fear	1
working	0

because_1	0
we	1
had	0
you	0
know	0
everything	1
was	0
rushed	1

i	0
bet	1

everything	1
we	0
had	0
like	0
an	0
hour	1
or	0
two	1
hours	0
at	0
the	0
louvre	1
you	0
know	1
things	0
like	0
that	1
where	0
you	0
need	1
the	0
whole	0
day	0
but	0
but	0
it	0
really	1

right	1

that's	1
where	0
a	0
a	0
camcorder	1
would	0
come	1
in	0
handy	1

exactly	1
that's	1
true	1

well	0
that	1
sounds	0
real	1
neat	1
so	1
y[ou]	0
you	0
haven't	1
been	0
back	0
to	0
Europe	0
since	1
though	0
huh	0

no	1
i	0
always	1
thought	0
i	0
would	0
but	1
who	0
knows	1
now	1
i	0
got	0
married	1
and	0
maybe	0
some	1
day	0
maybe	0
that's	1
one	0
of	0
these	0
retirement	1
things	1

there	1
you	0
go	1
well	1
does	0
you	0
husband	1
uh	0
what	0
does	0
he	1
think	0
of	0
your	1
uh	0
T-shirt	1
an[d]	0
and	0

well	1
he	1
he	1
likes	0
it	0
all	0
right	0
he's	0
been	1
pretty	0
good	1
because_1	0
there's	0
T-shirt	1
stuff	1
all	0
over	0
the	0
[laughter-house]	1

does	0
he	0
help	1
out	1
much	0
or	0

all	1
right	1

have	1
you	1
ever	1
been	0
drug	1
tested	1

um	0
that's	1
a	0
good	0
question	1
um	1
uh	0
i	0
had	1
a	1
job	1
i	0
had	1
to	0
go	0
get	0
a	0
blood	1
test	0
for	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
and	1

and	1
they	1
and	1
they	0
did	0
a	0
full	1
blood	1
screen	0
on	1
me	0
but	0
they	1
didn't	0
call	1
that	0
a	0
drug	1
test	0
so	0
tha[t]	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
checked	1
for	0
drugs	0
they	0
just	0
don't	0
tell	1
you	0
they	1
did	0

yeah	1

i	0
had	1
i've	1
had	0
uh	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
drug	1
tests	0
that	0
i	0
had	1
to	0
get	1
before	1
i	0
could	0
start	0
working	1
at	0
a	0
job	1
uh	0
different	1
jobs	1
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
had	0
one	1
at	0
TI	1
and	0
then	0
one	0
at	1
another	0
engineering	1
company	0
and	0
really	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
don't	0
mind	1
them	0
i	1
don't	0
do	0
drugs	1
anyway	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
i	0
did	1
maybe	0
i	0
would	1
[laughter-but]	0
um	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	1
know	0
a	0
girl	1
that	0
she's	1
a	0
nurse	1
and	0
they	1
get	0
drug	0
tested	0
randomly	1
i've	1
never	0
been	0
randomly	1
drug	0
tested	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
that	1
would	0
probably	0
bother	1
me	0
to	0
wake	1
up	0
one	0
day	1
and	0
find	1
out	0
halfway	0
through	0
the	1
day	0
that	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
be	1
drug	1
tested	1
and	1
you	1
didn't	0
know	1
about	1
it	1

yeah	0
well	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
depends	1
on	0
if	0
you	0
got	1
something	0
to	0
worry	1
about	0

yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
so	0
i	0
guess	1
so	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
that	0
it's	0
right	1

well	1
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
i	0
come	1
from	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
biased	1
opinion	1
because	0
i'm	1
a	0
a	1
therapist	1
and	1
a	0
drug	1
and	0
alcohol	1
counselor	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
i've	1
done	0
employee	0
assistant	1
work	0
and	0
i	0
i	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
kind	1
of	0
cost	1
businesses	1
go	0
through	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
accidents	1
on	0
the	0
job	1
that	0
are	0
specifically	1
drug	0
and	0
alcohol	0
related	1

right	0

right	0

and	0
it's	0
like	0
in	0
the	0
billions	1
of	0
dollars	1
every	0
year	1
um	0
and	0
th[e]	0
the	0
only	0
way	1
that	0
they	1
can	0
prevent	1
that	0
is	0
is	0
you	1
know	0
making	0
sure	1
that	0
the	0
employees	1
are	0
drug	1
and	0
alcohol	0
free	1

that's	0
true	1

and	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
the	0
problem	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
is	0
that	0
that	0
people	1
are	0
like	1
if	0
your	0
boss	1
is	0
your	0
drinking	1
buddy	0
or	0
whatever	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
can	0
come	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
work	1
drunk	1
and	0
get	1
in	0
an	1
accident	1
and	0
he'll	1
cover	0
up	1
for	0
you	0
and	0
nobody	0
knows	1
about	0
it	0
but	0

right	0

but	0
c[ould]	0
you	0
know	1
ends	1
up	0
costing	1
the	0
company	1
lots	1
and	0
lots	1
of	0
money	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

i	1
believe	0
it's	0
right	1
especially	1
for	0
certain	1
jobs	1

you	1
know	0
there	1

i	0
think	0
anyone	1
in	0
a	0
in	0
a	0
public	1
job	0
like	1
bus	1
drivers	1
and	0
cab	1
drivers	0
and	0
police	1
officers	0
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
i	1

uh-huh	0

i	1
think	0
they	1
should	0
be	0
randomly	1
drug	1
tested	0
i	1

yeah	0

i	1
believe	0
full	1
force	1
in	0
that	1

yeah	1

i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
i	1
believe	1
every	0
secretary	1
in	0
every	0
company	1
needs	0
to	1
be	1

true	1

you	1
know	0
secretaries	1
aren't	0
aren't	1
really	0
going	0
to	0
cost	1
the	0
company	1
that	1
much	0
money	1
if	0
they	0
fall	1
face	1
forward	0
in	0
their	1
typewriter	1
or	0
something	1
[laughter-so]	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i'm	1
kind	0
of	0
biased	1
too	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
do	1
drugs	0
and	0
so	1
i	1
really	0
don't	1
care	1
one	0
way	0
or	0
another	1
if	0
anybody	1
wants	0
to	0
pull	0
me	0
up	0
tomorrow	1
and	0
test	1
me	0
because	0
i	0
have	1
nothing	0
to	1
worry	1
about	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

so	0
i	1
guess	0
that's	1
kind	0
of	0
biased	1

yeah	0
well	1
and	0
it's	0
i	0
i	0
think	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
problems	1
with	0
it	0
is	0
it	0
affects	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
other	1
folks	0
on	0
the	0
job	1
if	0
somebody	0
else	1
is	0
impaired	1

yeah	1
it	0
does	1

because	1
generally	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
um	0
you	0
find	0
out	1
one	1
way	0
or	0
another	1
if	0
somebody's	1
got	0
a	0
problem	1
on	0
the	0
job	1

yeah	1
that's	1
true	0

and	1
if	0
e[ven]	0
even	1
if	0
like	1
you	0
say	1
even	1
if	0
it's	0
just	1
the	0
secretary	1
if	0
her	0
work	1
or	0
abilities	1
start	0
affecting	1
her	0
coworkers	1
then	1
it	0
it's	0
still	1
a	0
problem	1

yeah	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

but	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
do	0
about	0
the	0
occasional	1
user	0
that	0
may	1
have	0
gone	1
to	0
a	0
party	1
three	1
days	0
before	1

and	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
it's	0
been	1
the	0
whole	0
weekend	1
since	0
they've	0
done	1
anything	0
and	0
they	0
happen	1
to	0
be	0
tested	1
Monday	0
morning	1
and	0
they	1
could	0
be	0
fired	1
for	0
that	0
you	0
know	1
that	1
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
unfair	0
also	1

well	0
yeah	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
comes	1
with	0
the	0
turf	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
so	1
i	0
guess	0
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
suffer	1
the	0
[laughter-consequences]	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
you're	0
i[n]	0
i[n]	0
in	0
terms	1
of	0
drugs	1
they're	0
illegal	1
so	0
you're	0
you're	0
breaking	1
the	0
law	0
anyway	1

that's	1
true	0

that's	0
true	1

probably	1
the	0
the	0
biggest	1
problem	0
with	0
those	1
is	0
they	0
don't	1
do	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
job	1
of	0
of	0
assessing	1
for	0
alcohol	1

that's	0
true	1

and	0
that's	1
probably	0
the	0
biggest	1
problem	0
there	0
is	1

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
so	1
more	1
than	0
drugs	1
and	0
i	1
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
companies	0
that	0
will	1
put	1
you	0
in	0
an	0
alcohol	1
rehabilitation	0
before	1
they	0
would	0
put	0
you	0
in	0
a	0
drug	1
rehab	0

yeah	0

they	0
would	0
pay	1
for	0
an	0
alcohol	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
they	1
don't	0
always	0
pay	1
for	0
drug	1
rehabilitation	0

well	0
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
positive	1
things	0
that	1
ha[s]	0
has	1
come	0
out	1
of	0
it	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
employee	0
assistance	1
program	1
if	0
you	0
do	1
test	0
positive	1
for	0
something	0
they	0
will	1
give	0
you	0
an	0
opp[ortunity]	0
o[pportunity]	0
opportunity	1
to	0
go	1
get	0
your	0
life	1
straight	0
rather	1
than	0
to	0
lose	1
your	0
job	1

yeah	0

that's	1
true	0

and	0
i	1
th[ink]	0

i	1
think	0
that's	0
fair	1

th[ink]	0

yeah	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
benef[its]	1
the	0
company	1
benefits	0
in	0
the	0
long	1
run	0

yeah	0
that's	1
true	0
that's	1
about	0
all	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
say	0
on	1
it	0

what	1
what	1
kind	0
of	0
testing	1
do	0
they	0
do	1
when	0
you	0
went	1

uh	0
it's	0
a	0
urine	1
test	0

urine	0
screen	1
yeah	1

and	1
they	0
uh	0

yeah	1

it	0
was	0
really	1
very	1
official	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
in	1
a	0
room	1
solely	1
by	0
yourself	0
sign	0
papers	1
that	0
say	1
you	0
were	0
totally	1
alone	1
sign	1
papers	0
that	0
say	1
this	0
is	0
yours	1
and	0

and	0
and	0
you	1
have	0
to	0
fill	1
the	0
bottle	1
yourself	1
and	0
label	1
it	0
yourself	1
and	0
all	1
of	0
that	1
so	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
that	0
they're	0
sure	1
that	0
you	0
haven't	1
borrowed	1
anybody's	0
i	0
guess	1
or	0
something	1

well	0
that	1
happens	1

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
i	0

i	0
ca[n't]	1
it's	0
hard	1
to	0
believe	1
but	0

[laughter-it]	0
happens	0
a	0
lot	1

but	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
does	1

there	0
there	0
are	0
people	1
that	0
kn[ow]	0
pay	1
other	0
people	0
for	0
that	0
to	0
help	1
them	0
out	0

i	0
know	1
i'm	0
amazed	1
at	0
the	0
things	0
people	1
will	0
do	1

yeah	1

it	0
is	1
amazing	1
i	0
guess	1
there	0
are	1
people	0
that	0
do	1
that	0
and	0
they	1
are	0
those	1
are	0
expensive	0
tests	1
i'm	0
glad	1
i	0
never	0
had	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
one	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
it	0
depends	1
r[eally]	0
r[eally]	0
really	1
on	0
how	1
how	0
strong	1
a	0
test	0
it	0
is	1
they've	0
got	0
different	0
degrees	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
as	0
how	1
far	0
back	1
they	0
can	0
check	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	0
so	1

they	0
got	1
some	0
unusual	1
things	0
besides	1
blood	0
and	0
urine	1
tests	0
they've	0
they've	1
got	0
some	1
companies	0
that	0
are	0
doing	1
um	0
hair	1
tests	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1
well	0
that	1
they'll	0
pull	1
out	0
one	0
of	0
your	0
hairs	1
and	0
they	0
can	0
apparently	1
test	1
um	0
back	1
a	0
certain	0
period	0
of	0
time	1
um	0
because	1
um	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
residue	1
ends	0
up	0
in	0
your	0
hair	1
follicles	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0

how	1
weird	1
i	0
didn't	1
know	0
that	1

it's	0
kind	1
of	0

oh	0
that's	0
weird	1

hair	1
follicles	0
i	0
guess	1
are	0
just	0
dead	0
protein	1
and	0
they	0

yeah	1

and	0
it	0
it's	0
apparently	1
al[most]	0
almost	0
like	1
a	0
a	0
calendar	1
they	0
they've	0
got	1
it	0
pretty	1
precise	1
now	1
that	0
they	0
can	0
go	0
back	1
and	0
look	1
at	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
growth	1
in	0
a	0
hair	1
when	1
you	0
used	1
and	1
and	0
that	1
type	0
of	0
thing	0

that's	1
wild	1

so	0

it's	1
amazing	1
the	0
things	1
they	0
can	0
find	0
out	1
from	0
different	0
things	1
on	0
your	0
body	1

yeah	0
so	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
they	0
perfect	1
that	1
and	0
then	0
it's	0
not	1
quite	1
as	0
cumbersome	1
as	0
having	0
to	0
go	0
fill	1
a	0
bottle	1
or	0
give	0
blood	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
[laughter-that's]	1
[laughter-true]	1

that's	1
true	0
i'm	1
glad	1
i	0
never	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
by	0
giving	0
blood	1
i	0
can't	1
stand	1
the	0
thought	0
of	0
giving	0
blood	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
can't	1
even	0
do	1
it	0
for	0
Wadley	1
even	0
though	0
it's	0
a	0
good	0
cause	1

yeah	0

well	0
i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	1
to	0
you	0

well	1
i	1
did	0
too	1

thank	1
you	0

uh-huh	0
bye	1

bye	1
bye	0

bye	1
bye	0

seems	1
to	1
be	0
a	1
a	0
topic	1
that's	0
gonna	1
probably	1
take	0
about	1
a	0
generation	0
to	0
uh	0
catch	1
on	0
it	0
seems	0
or	1
maybe	0
a	0
generation	0
to	0
two	1
and	1
we	0
may	1
have	1
to	0
do	0
it	0
out	0
of	0
necessity	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
moving	1
that	0
time	1
schedule	0
up	1
but	0
it	0
does	1
seem	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
habits	1
to	0
break	0
i	0
um	0
wasn't	0
raised	1
as	0
a	0
kid	1
on	0
it	0
but	0
my	1
kids	1
are	1
and	0
so	0
they	0
they	0
tended	1
to	0
wanna	1
grab	1
the	0
aluminum	0
cans	1
when	0
that	1
was	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
first	1
things	0
to	0
do	0
and	0
we	0
were	0
doing	0
all	0
right	1
there	0
until	0
uh	0
the	0
price	1
dropped	0
out	0
and	0
they	0
weren't	0
worth	1
anything	0
anymore	1

um-hum	1

and	1
we	1
it	1
took	0
us	0
um	0
almost	1
a	1
year	1
to	0
get	0
a	0
garbage	1
sack	1
full	1
we	0
just	0
don't	0
drink	1
that	0
many	0
so	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
at	0
home	1
use	0
uh	0
we'll	0
pick	0
up	0
a	0
six	1
pack	0
every	0
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	0
or	0
for	0
whatever	0
occasion	1
of	0
Dr	0
Pepper	1
or	0
something	0
and	0
and	0
by	0
the	0
time	0
we	0
gathered	1
up	0
enough	1
crushed	1
cans	1
to	0
take	0
it	0
in	1
uh	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
it	0
was	0
still	0
oh	0
about	0
forty	1
or	0
fifty	0
cents	1
a	0
pound	1
and	0
we	0
came	0
out	0
with	0
about_1	0
a	0
dollar	1
[laughter-it]	0
just	0
really	1
wasn't	0
worth	1
it	0

and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
hassle	1
all	0
year	0
round	1
and	0
cans	1
laying	0

yeah	1
so	0

yeah	0

so	0
they	1
they	0
realized	0
you	0
know	0
well	0
of	0
course	0
to	0
them	1
a	0
dollar	1
was	0
a	0
dollar	1
at	0
four	1
and	0
five	1
years	0
old	1
that	0
wasn't	0
uh	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
big	1
deal	1
but	0
we	0
decided	1
it	0
wasn't	0
worth	0
us	1
keeping	0
it	0
and	0
then	0
um	0
TI	1
started	0
keeping	1
up	1
with	0
uh	0
cans	0
there	1
so	0
occasionally	1
i'll	0
bring	1
whatever	0
i've	0
got	1
laying	0
around	0
the	0
car	0
or	1
the	0
like	1
and	0
throw	0
them_1	0
in	0
there	1
least	0
it	0
gets	0
back	1
into	0
the	0
system	1
but	0
um	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
a	0
habit	1
at	0
the	0
house	0
uh	0
i	0
haven't	0
started	1
on	0
anything	0
other	1
than	0
just	0
whatever	0
the	0
city	1
wants	0
to	0
pick	0
up	0
have	0
y'all	1
got	0
the	0
individual	1
containers	0
yet	0

no	1
i	0
read	1
in	0
the	0
paper	1
this	0
week	0
where	0
maybe	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it	0
w[as]	0
was	0
i	0
guess	1
maybe	0
this	1
week	0
someone	0
may	1
start	0
getting	1
them	0
if	0
the	0
truck	0
that	0
picks	0
them_1	0
up	0
is	0
outfitted	1
in	0
time	0

hm	0

but	0
i	0
it	0
it	0
should	0
be	0
starting	1
i	1
would	0
stay	1
probably	0
in	0
the	0
next	0
month	1
if	0
if	0
everything	0
goes	1
that	0
uh	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	1
all	0
what	0
we're	0
gonna	0
have	0
to	0
do	1
whether	0
we	0
have	0
three	1
separate	0
containers	1
i	0
really	0
don't	0
understand	1
that	0
part	1
on	0
what	0
they've	0
told	1
you	1
to	0
separate	0
everything	1

right	0
yeah	1
it	0
seemed	1
like	1
uh	0
if	0
if	0
i	0
recall	1
it's	0
been	0
a	0
long	1
time	0
they're	0
way	1
behind	0
schedule	1
on	0
that	1
particular	0
part	0
of	0
it	0
they	0
were	0
fine	1
on	0
the	0
green	1
big	1
green	0
containers	0
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
seems	1
like	0
they	0
said	1
they	0
were	0
just	0
gonna	0
have	0
a	0
bin	1
and	0
all	0
s[orts]	0
different	0
types	1
would	0
go	0
in	0
there	1
and	0
then	0
that	0
they	1
would	0
sort	1
it	0
as	0
as	0
needed	1
it	0

oh	0

it	0
it	0
seemed	1
that	0
there	0
was	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
anyway	1
the	0
thinking	0
was	1
that	0
there	1
was	0
too	1
much	0
not	1
getting	0
sorted	1
properly	1
and	0
that	0
at	0
at	0
the	0
collection	1
sites	0
where	0
everything's	0
clearly	1
labeled	0
and	0
people	0
that	0
happen	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
trouble	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
happen	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
pretty	0
well	1
uh	0
those	1
are	0
okay	1
to	0
have	0
the	0
general	1
public	1
doing	0
the	0
sorting	1
but	0
when	0
it	0
comes	1
down	1
to	0
just	0
general	1
purpose	0
trash	1
that	0
all	1
the	0
houses	1
um	0
the	0
success	1
rate	0
of	0
getting	0
it	0
sorted	1
properly	1
seemed	0
to	0
be	0
poor	1
so	0
they	0
felt	1
that	0
having	1
one	1
guy	1
just	0
sit	1
there	0
and	0
run	0
through	1
it	0
real	0
quick	0
was	0
better	1
than	0
than	0
having	0
a	0
household	1
try	0
it	0
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
sounds	0
like	0
an	0
awful	1
lot	0
of	0
labor	1
to	0
sort	0
the	0
entire	1
week's	0
worth	0
of	0
trash	1
for	0
a	0
house	0

well	1
it'd	0
get	0
messy	1
too	0

yeah	1
yeah	0

i	0
i	0
i	0
know	0
other	0
places	1
when	0
they	0
recycle	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
like	0
wash	1
out	0
their	0
glass	1
jars	0
and	0
whatnot	0
and	0
uh	0
which	0
we're	0
not	1
in	0
the	0
habit	0
of	0
doing	1
i	1

right	1

that's	1
true	0

i	1
was	0
brought	0
up	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
long	0
time	1
ago	1
that	0
they	0
didn't	0
even	0
have	1
cans	0
they	0
had	0
bottles	1
and	0
you'd	0
return	0
them	0
to	0
the	0
the	0
grocery	0
store	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
you'd	0
get	0
your	0
money	0
back	1
and	0
that	0
that	1
was	0
all	0
well	1
and	0
good	1
and	0
they	0
don't	0
seem	1
to	0
still	1
be	0
doing	0
that	0
if	0
they	0
could	0
just	0
eliminate	1
the	0
cans	0
and	0
use	0
glass	1
but	0
i	0
guess	1
this	1
day	0
and	0
age	0
they	0
don't	1

yeah	0

they	0
don't	0
do	1
that	0
we	1
live	1
next	0
to	0
a	0
set	0
of	0
railroad	1
tracks	0
and	0
it	0
seemed	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
very	0
popular	1
thing	1
for	0
people	0
driving	0
by	1
that	0
highway	1
there	0
by	0
our	0
tracks	1
to	0
throw	0
the	0
bottles	0
at	1
the	0
tracks	0
and	0
try	0
to	0
crash	1
you	0
know	0
break	1
them_1	0
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
they	0
weren't	1
that	0
successful	1
so	0
there	0
were	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
bottles	1
to	0
be	0
returned	0
and	0
we	0
just	0
walk	1
about	0
a	0
half	1
a	0
mile	0
in	0
each	0
direction	1
and	0
gathered	0
up	0
enough	0
to	0
buy	1
whatever	0
we	0
wanted	1
for	0
the	0
day	1
[laughter-and]	0

um-hum	0

[laughter-and]	0

yeah	1
and	0
they	0
uh	0
p[eople]	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
kids	1
don't	0
appreciate	1
maybe	0
the	0
value	1
of	0
money	0
that	0
it's	0
so	0
little	1
that	0
they	0
don't	0
care	1
they	0
can	0
get	0
more	1
somewhere	0
else	1
uh	0

yeah	0
just	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
begging	1
will	0

uh	0
for	0
a	0
good	1
many	0
right	0
they're	0
the	0
the	0
nickels	1
the	0
dimes	1
or	0
what	0
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-suppose]	0
[laughter-it]	0
[laughter-might]	1
be	0
quarter	1
and	0
fifty	0
cent	1
pieces	0
in	1
these	0
days	0
that	1
they	0
would	0
get	1
they	0
the	0
kids	1
just	0
don't	1
seem	0
to	0
to	0
care	1
that	1
that	0
much	1
about	0
a	0
small	0
amount	0
of	0
money	0

right	0
well	1
i	0
wonder	0
if	0

but	0
now	0
we	0
we	1
did	0
buy	0
a	0
can	1
crusher	0
and	0
we	0
are	1
crushing	0
cans	0
and	0
when	0
we	0
buy	1
the	0
soda	1
when	0
it's	0
on	0
sale	1
for	0
ninety	1
nine	1
cents	1
so	0
i	1
would	0
say	0
in	0
the	0
last	0
three	1
years	0
we've	0
probably	0
used	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
cans	0
than	0
ever	1
before	0

yeah	0

um	0
it	0
was	0
just	0
easier	1
to	0
do	0
that	1
than	0
to	0
open	0
a	0
large	1
liter	1
bottle	1
and	0
then	0
have	0
it	0
go	0
flat	1

right	0
yep	0

so	0
that's	1
the	0
main	1
reason	0
we're	0
we	0
uh	0
sort	0
of	0
are	0
into	1
cans	1
[laughter-at]	0
[laughter-this]	0
point	0
rather	0
than	0
the	0
liter	1
[laughter-bottles]	0

where	1
do	0
you	0
take	1
your	0
cans	0

well	1
as	0
you	0
say	1
it	0
takes	0
a	0
while	1
to	0
build	0
it	0
up	1
since	0
we've	0
had	0
the	0
crusher	1
all	0
summer	1
we	0
i	0
guess	1
we	0
just	0
now	1
maybe	0
have	0
a	0
bag	1
full	1
that	0
we	0
haven't	0
ta[ken]	0
oh	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
kids	1
when	0
we	0
were	0
on	0
vacation	0
they	0
said	0
they	0
did	0
take	0
them_1	0
to	0
a	0
a	0
recycling	1
place	0
probably	0
at	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
li[braries]	0

so	1
do	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
recycling	1
programs	1
there	1

um	1
i	1
don't	1
really	1
think	1
we	1
have	1
anything	1
in	0
the	0
works	1
as	0
of	0
yet	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
we're	1
pretty	0
small	1
town	1
and	0
um	0
the	0
closest	1
thing	0
we	0
have	0
are	1
bins	1
like	0
out	1
in	0
front	0
of	1
Wal-Mart	1
that	0
show	1
you	1
know	0
plastics	1
paper	1
liter	1
bottles	0
et	0
cetera	1
et	0
cetera	1

oh	0
uh-huh	0

yeah	1

we've	1
progressed	1
a	0
little	1
bit	1
farther	0
than	1
that	1
um	0

yeah	0

um	0
actually	1
they	0
have	1
uh	0
parts	1
of	0
town	1
it	0
may	1
have	0
even	1
spread	1
all	0
over	0
the	1
whole	1
town	0
and	0
um	0
they	0
have	1
these	0
green	1
bins	1

um-hum	0

and	0
it's	0
just	1
as	0
standard	1
as	0
a	0
a	0
regular	1
trash	1
can	0
that	0
they	0
come	0
by	1
and	0
pick	0
up	1
and	0
dump	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
just	1
along	0
with	0
a	0
trash	1
can	0
you	0
have	0
this	0
this	0
green	1
plastic	0
bin	1
and	1
you	0
put	1
your	0
bottles	1
in	0
it	0
and	0
paper	1
and	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
all	1
those	0
things	1
that	0
aluminum	1
you	1
know	0
anything	1
that	0
can	0
be	0
recycled	1
you	0
just	0
put	1
in	0
that	0
bin	1

oh	0

and	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
you	0
can	0
al[so]	0
and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
restaurants	1
they	1
just	0
have	1
uh	0
places	1
where	0
you	0
can	0
throw	1
away	0
especially	1
beer	1
places	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
throw	1
away	0
green	1
bottles	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
brown	1
bottles	0

yeah	0

huh	0

and	0
uh	0
oh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
i	0
guess	1
they're	0
you	1
know	0
clear	1
bottles	0

yeah	0

so	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
do	1
have	0
those	1
separated	0
and	1
of	0
course	1
they	0
have	1
the	1
um	0
dumpsters	1
uh	0
the	0
the	0
igloos	1

yeah	0

uh	0
and	0
they	1
have	0
those	1
strateg[ically]	0
strategically	1
placed	1
around	0
the	1
city	1

oh	0

and	1
uh	0
they're	0
they're	0
actually	1
gonna	0
extend	1
it	0
i	0
think	1
one	1
of	0
these	0
days	0
maybe	0
to	0
apartment	1
complexes	0
and	0
uh	0

oh	0
that'd	1
be	0
good	1

yeah	1
things	0
of	0
that	1
nature	1
so	0
i	0
guess	1
when	0
you	0
live	1
in	0
a	0
bigger	0
city	1
it	0
it	0
really	1
becomes	0
uh	0
necessary	1

yeah	1
see	1
it's	1
not	0
anywhere	1
near	0
that	1
uh	0

uh	0
we	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
our	1
little	0
pitch	1
in	0
to	0
it	0
we	0
do	1
recycle	0
our	0
aluminum	0
cans	1

oh	0
yeah	0

but	0
that's	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
we	1
go	0
because_1	0
i	1
take	0
them_1	0
to	0
a	0
girl	0
at	0
work	1
and	0
she	1
goes	1
and	0
cashes	0
them	0
in	1
because	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
just	0
i	0
can	0
do	1
that	0
for	0
her	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
want	0
the	0
hassle	1
because_1	0
we	1
have	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
another	0
town	1
to	0
do	1
it	0

yeah	0

oh	0
really	0

yeah	0
see	0

hm	1

see	0
we	0
don't	0
have	1
anything	0
here	0
in	0
Belton	1
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
pretty	1
small	0
little	0
town	1

yeah	0
i	0
remember	0
my	0
grandparents	1
and	0
i	0
used	0
to	0
always	1
get	0
out	0
there	0
on	0
the	0
road	1
and	0
pick	0
up	0
beer	1
cans	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0

so	1
yeah	0
that's	1
about	0
all	1
th[at]	0
that	1
we're	1
doing	1
here	1
uh	1
they're	0
uh	0
getting	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
on	0
they	0
need	1
to	0
a	0
lot	1
a	0
more	0
community	0
awareness	1
of	0
just	0
what	1
is	0
it	0
mean	0
to	0
recycle	1
and	0
what	1
can	1
you	0
recycle	0
and	0
what	1
you	0
can't	1
because	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
do	1
really	1
know	0
what	1
you	1
know	0
what	1
it's	0
for	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
they're	1
doing	1
a	0
real	1
good	0
job	1
of	0
uh	0
separating	1
it	0
here	0
and	0
of	0
course	1
there	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
have	1
a	0
specific	0
place	1
to	0
put	0
your	0
paper	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
they	0
try	1
to	0
get	0
you	0
to	0
go	0
ahead	0
and	0
separate	1
it	0
but	0
uh	0
they	0
actually	1
have	1
the	0
door	0
to	0
door	0
pickup	1
um	0
and	0
it's	0
uh	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
started	0
out	1
to	0
be	0
um	0
just	0
kind	0
of	1
a	0
test	1
a	0
pilot	1
project	0

um-hum	0

and	0
it	0
went	1
over	0
so	0
well	1
that	0
they	0
just	0
extended	1
it	0
and	0
it's	0
almost	1
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
done	0
by	0
a	0
private	1
company	0
or	0
not	1
it	0
may	1
be	1
but	0
uh	0
they	0
just	0
go	0
around	1
to	0
each	1
uh	0
door	1
and	0
pick	0
it	0
up	1

wow	1
that's	1
excellent	1

yeah	0

that's	1
good	1

let's	1
see	1
oh	0
and	0
every	1
year	1
of	0
course	1
the	0
phone	1
books	0
um	0
they	1
tell	0
everybody	1
across	0
the	0
city	1
to	0
um	0
put	0
all	1
their	0
phone	1
books	0
in	0
uh	0
the	0
uh	0
recycle	1
bins	0

yeah	0

oh	0

because	1
you	1
know	0
phone	1
books	0
are	0
pretty	1
well	1
for	0
a	0
bigger	1
city	0
they're	0
pretty	1
thick	1

yeah	1
they	1
uh	0

and	0
sometimes	1
you	0
might	0
have	0
two	1
or	0
three	1

exactly	1

so	0
uh	0
that's	1
that's	1
a	0
big	0
savings	0
right	0
there	1
in	0
itself	1

yeah	0
see	1
ours	1
just	0
goes	0
in	0
the	0
regular	0
trash	1

yeah	1

it	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
there's	0
not	1
a	0
whole	0
lot	1

hm	0

and	0
there	0
are	1
you	1
know	0
some	1
places	0
that	0
we'll	0
set	0
up	1
you	0
know	1
for	0
old	0
newspapers	1
and	0
stuff	1

um-hum	0

but	1
usually	1
it's	0
it	0
it	0
hasn't	1
caught	0
on	1
yet	0
i'm	0
hoping	1
it	0
will	1
soon	0

um-hum	0
well	0
the	0
thing	1
about	0
newspapers	1
and	0
paper	1
recycled	1
paper	1
is	0
actually	1
very	0
expensive	1

yeah	0

so	1
when	0
you	0
see	1
something	0
that's	0
on	0
recycled	1
paper	1
they've	0
actually	1
gone	0
to	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
expense	1
to	0
do	1
that	0
it's	0
uh	0
they're	0
not	1
coming	0
out	0
ahead	1
at	0
all	1
it's	0
uh	0
it's	0
really	1
a	0
cost	1

hm	0
i	0
wasn't	0
totally	0
aware	1
of	0
that	0

yeah	1

so	0

i	0
mean	1
it	0
it	0
sounds	1
good	0
to	0
the	0
public	1
but	0
there's	0
really	1
a	0
big	0
cost	1
incurred	1
when	0
you	0
do	1
recycle	1
something	0
now	0
aluminum	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
they	0
may	1
be	0
coming	0
out	0
ahead	1
but	0
i	1
know	0
for	0
a	0
fact	1
that	0
the	0
paper	1
uh	0
on	0
that	1
end	0
they're	0
not	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	0

it's	1
it's	0
good	0
to	0
recycle	1
but	0
it's	0
uh	0
not	1
to	0
their	0
advantage	1

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
costs	1
less	0

hm	0
well	1

i	1
can't	0
think	1
of	0
anything	0
else	1

i	0
can't	1
either	0
because_1	0
we're	1
we're	1
at	0
a	0
very	0
you	0
know	0
beginning	1
stages	1
so	1

[laughter-okay]	1

so	1

uh-huh	0

we	1
look	0
forward	1
to	0
it	0
to	0
get	0
better	1
but	0
that's	0

well	1
i	0
hope	1
y'all	1
um	0
uh	0
come	0
along	1
a	0
little	0
farther	1
in	0
the	0
future	1

yeah	1
me	0
too	1

it	0
was	0
nice	1
talking	1
to	0
you	0

you	0
too	1

bye-bye	1

bye	1

it's	1
it's	1
hard	1
to[pic]	1
topic	1
because	0
is	1
it	1
is	1
it	0
is	1
it	0
doing	0
a	0
good	0
job	1
or	0
a	0
bad	1
job	1
and	0
you	0
got	0
to	0
divide	1
it	0
two	1
different	0
categories	1
whether	1
you	0
live	0
in	0
the	0
city	1
or	1
whether	0
you	0
live	1
in	1
a	0
more	1
rural	1
place	1
like	0
i	1
do	1

yeah	1
and	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about	1
public	1
schools	1
being	1
lower	1
level	1
high	1
school	0
level	1
or	1
state	1
school	0

well	0
public	0
school	0
all	0
the	0
way	0
up	0
kindergarten	0
all	0
the	0
way	0
up	0
to	0
uh	0
uh	0
high	0
school	0

okay	0
but	0
you're	0
excluding	1
high-level	1
education	1

yes	0
well	0
yeah	1
i	0
am	0
um	0

okay	0

act[ually]	0
actually	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
i	0
at	0
the	0
higher	0
level	0
education	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
there's	0
so	0
much	0
of	0
a	0
problem	1
there	1
it's	0
pretty	1
much	0
funded	1
well	0
there	0
are	1
small	0
colleges	1
that	1
i'm	0
sure	0
are	0
struggling	1
but	1
uh	0
it's	0
the	0
job	1
that	0
the	0
the	0
high	1
school	0
and	0
the	0
grade	1
schools	0
are	1
doing	0
that	1
i	0
see	1
in	0
a	0
area	1
like	0
ours	0
our	0
school	0
even	0
a	0
bad	1
school	0
is	0
a	0
good	1
school	0
up	0
here	1
where	1
if	0
i	0
lived	1
in	0
New	0
York	0
City	1
or	0
Washington	1
DC	1
uh	0
i	1
would	0
seriously	0
consider	0
moving	1
if	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
child	1
i	0
wouldn't	0
let	0
them	0
go	1
to	0
a	0
public	1
school	0
system	0
there	0
but	0
of	0
course	1
people	0
are	0
trapped	1
economically	1
and	0
they	1
can't	0
do	1
that	1

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
down	1
here	0
the	0
school's	1
are	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
they	0
rate	0
i	0
moved	0
to	0
Arkansas	1
and	0
Texas	1
after	1
living	0
in	0
Ohio	1
and	0
the	0
schools	0
down	0
here	0
rate	0
you	0
know	0
bottom	0
ten	0
percent	0
across	0
the	0
country	0
and	0
having	0
been	1
through	0
grade	1
school	0
up	0
there	1
and	0
coming	0
down	1
here	0
to	0
high	1
school	0
i	0
can	0
understand	0
why	1
because	0
they're	0
so	1
far	0
behind	1
and	0
so	1
poorly	0
staffed	1
half	1
the	0
time	0
the	0
teachers	1
don't	0
know	0
what's	0
going	0
on	1

well	0
that's	1
really	0
too	0
bad	1
because	1
i[t]	0
it	0
it's	0
giving	0
some	0
people	1
unfair	0
advantage	1
i	0
mean	0
we	1
our	0
high	1
school	0
up	0
here	1
is	0
like	0
a	0
junior	0
college	1
in	0
Florida	1

right	0

what	0
we	0
learned	0

well	1
that	0
was	1
my	1
experience	1
going	0
through	1
junior	1
high	0
up	0
there	1
when	0
i	1
came	1
down	1
south	1
for	1
high	1
school	1
i	1
was	1
just	0
repeating	1
what	1
i'd	1
already	1
done	1
because	0
we	0
were	0
so	1
far	0
advanced	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
i'd	0
been	0
in	0
a	0
parochial	1
school	0
before	1
junior	1
high	0
and	1
you	1
know	1
even	0
the	1
public	1
schools	0
are	1
behind	1
the	0
parochial	1
schools	1

yeah	0

so	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i	0
like	1
the	0
concept	1
they've	0
got	1
now	1
where	0
they	1
have	0
more	1
directed	1
education	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
pick	1
a	0
career	1
path	1
or	0
you	0
get	0
counseling	1
earlier	1
and	0
then	1
you	0
you	0
learn	1
the	0
things	1
that	0
help	1
you	0
rather	0
than	0
spending	1
four	1
years	1
learning	0
the	0
same	1
things	0
over	0
and	0
over	1

oh	0
they	0
they	0
have	1
that	0
down	0
there	1
that	0

well	1
they	0
talk	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
there	0
are	1
a	0
few	1
in	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
more	1
like	0
in	0
i	0
live	1
in	0
a	0
big	0
metroplex	1
and	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
better	1
parts	0
of	0
the	0
metroplex	1
the	0
the	0
suburbs	1
that	0
are	0
richer	1
have	1
those	0
kind	0
of	0
target	1
schools	0
but	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	0
it's	0
like	1
if	0
if	0
your	0
father	1
owns	0
a	0
grocery	1
store	0
and	1
you're	0
really	0
interested	1
in	1
that	1
there's	0
no	0
reason	1
that	1
you	0
should	1
take	1
college	1
prep	0
courses	1
when	0
you	1
can	0
get	1
some	0
general	1
business	1
courses	0
in	1
high	1
school	0

right	0

or	0
if	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
go	0
the	0
science	1
route	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
target	1
school	0
that	0
specializes	1
in	0
science	1
or	0
art	1
you	0
know	0
there's	0
no	1
point	1
in	0
you	0
know	1
i'm	1
an	0
engineering	1
student	0
and	0
if	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
go	0
take	0
art	1
classes	0
you	0
know	0
i'm	1
not	0
going	0
to	0
use	1
them_1	0
and	0
through	0
high	1
school	0
i	1
could	0
have	0
gone	0
so	0
much	0
further	1
if	0
i'd	0
gone	1
to	0
a	0
school	1
that	0
was	0
directed	1

yeah	0
that's	0
where	0
i	0
was	0
fortunate	0
i'm	1
a	0
i'm	0
a	0
technician	1
and	0
we	0
had	0
a	0
vocational	1
um	0
electronics	1
in	0
our	1
high	0
school	0

right	0
in	1
high	1
school	0

so	0
when	0
i	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
first	0
year	0
of	0
tech	1
school	1
uh	0
i	1
had	0
a	0
very	0
easy	0
time	1
because	0
our	0
high	1
school	0
had	1
a	0
a	0
good	1
program	0

right	0

i	0
think	1
the	0
schools	0
today	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
public	1
schools	0
are	0
just	0
they're	0
just	0
overrun	1
you	0
know	0
they	0
don't	0
know	0
what	1
to	0
do	1
there's	0
too	1
many	0
kids	1
and	0
not	1
enough	0
teachers	1
and	0
too	0
many	0
kids	0
don't	0
care	0

yeah	0
i	0
find	1
that	0
that	1
the	0
that	1
in	0
the	0
in	1
the	0
cities	1
it's	0
more	0
less	0
the	0
kids	0
go	0
there	1
to	0
socialize	1
not	0
really	0
to	0
learn	1
and	0

and	0

right	0

and	0
the	0
parents	1
send	0
them_1	0
there	1
because	0
they're	0
supposed	1
to	0
and	0
plus	0
it	0
gets	0
them	0
out	0
of	0
their	1
hair	1
and	0
i	0
also	1
find	1
that	0
that	0
you	0
can	1
send	1
a	0
kid	0
to	0
school	1
but	0
if	0
don't	0
work	0
with	0
them	0
as	0
a	0
parent	1
i	0
think	1
you're	0
putting	0
your	0
child	0
at	0
a	0
big	0
disadvantage	1

yeah	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
there's	0
some	1
kids	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
want	1
to	0
go	0
learn	1
but	0
most	0
of	0
them_1	0
just	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
play	0

yeah	0
well	0
i	0
could	1
i	1
could	0
see	1
if	0
a	0
kid	0
doesn't	0
have	0
any	0
encouragement	1
if	1
they're	1
you	0
know	0
come	0
from	0
a	0
broken	1
home	1
and	0
their	0
parents	1
are	0
more	0
concerned	0
about	1
trying	1
to	0
work	1
and	0
or	0
maybe	0
they're	0
unemployed	0
and	0
they're	0
mad	0
at	0
the	0
world	0
i	0
can	0
see	0
where	0
that	0
wouldn't	0
be	0
very	1
good	0
for	0
a	0
a	0
kid	1
you	0
know	1
he's	0
coming	0
up	1
will	0
you	0
help	1
me	0
with	0
my	0
homework	1
and	0
they're	1
no	1
get	0
away	1
from	0
me	0
i've	0
had	0
a	0
terrible	0
day	1
so	0
it's	0
got	1
a	0
lot	0
to	0
do	0
with	1
economics	1
in	0
the	1
area	1
that	1
you	0
come	1
from	0

yeah	0
that's	0
true	0
i'm	0
wondering	0
with	0
the	0
boom	0
down	0
here	0
it's	0
well	0
not	0
at	0
the	0
moment	0
but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
industry's	0
moving	1
southward	1

yes	0
are	0
they	0
going	0
to	0
move	1
to	0
uh	0
Mexico	1

so	0

oh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	1
about	0
that	1
but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
industry	1
up	1
in	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
northern	1
states	0
is	0
moving	0
south	1

and	0
i'm	0
wondering	1
if	0
that's	1
going	0
to	0
have	0
any	0
effect	1
you	0
know	0
on	0
what	0
you	1
see	0
now	1
we're	0
we're	0
we're	0
behind	1
down	0
here	1

yeah	0

i	0
say	0
we	1
because_1	0
i	0
live	1
here	0
if	0
that	0
might	0
not	1
turn	0
around	1
in	0
the	0
next	1
you	0
know	0
fifteen	1
twenty	0
years	1

yeah	0
maybe	1
the	0
maybe	0
they'll	0
bring	0
their	0
good	1
schools	1
with	0
them	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
the	0
industry	1
comes	1
hopefully	0
they'll	0
promote	1
good	0
schools	1

yeah	0

because	0
i	0
know	0
the	0
town	1
that	0
i	0
come	1
from	0
the	0
the	1
uh	0
the	0
large	1
IBM	1
plant	0
has	0
something	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
the	0
top	1
rated	0
high	0
school	0
because	0
of	0
their	0
tax	1
base	0
for	0
one	1
and	0
plus	1
for	0
for	1
the	0
type	1
of	0
student	1
that's	0
going	1
to	0
that	0
school	1
it's	0
going	0
to	0
raise	1
the	0
level	0
of	0
the	0
school	1
because	0
your	0
parents	1
are	0
engineers	1
or	0
chemists	1

right	0

they're	0
they're	0
you're	0
most	0
likely	1
to	0
do	0
better	1
in	0
school	1
they're	0
going	0
to	0
help	1
you	1

you	0
hope	0

yeah	0
you	0
hope	0
well	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0
just	0
think	1
it	0
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
duty	1
of	0
the	0
parent	1
to	0
do	1
that	0
i	0
mean	1
jeez	1
my	0
parents	1
always	0
helped	0
me	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
like	0
you	0
say	0
it's	0
the	0
way	1
you're	0
raised	1
and	0
the	1
economic	1
situation	1
you're	0
in	0
i	0
can	0
see	1
some	0
lady	1
she's	0
twenty	0
one	0
years	0
old	0
and	0
she's	0
got	0
four	1
kids	1
a	0
kid	0
in	0
her	0
first	0
grader	0
i	0
don't	1
see	0
where	0
she's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
much	0
time	1
for	0
him	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
like	0

i	0
guess	0
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
wonder	0
is	0
it	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
is	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
who	1
whose	1
supposed	0
to	0
make	1
the	0
change	1
the	0
the	0
state	0
the	0
govern[ment]	0
the	0
federal	0
government	0
you	0
know	0
where's	0
the	0
money	1
supposed	0
to	0
come	1
from	0
is	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
what	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
actually	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
should	0
be	1
a	0
civic	1
level	0
the	0
city	1
level	0
and	0
a	0
a	0
system	1
level	0
really	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
and	0
t[o]	0
to	0
see	0
what	0
they	0
need	1
and	0
not	0
overinflate	1
it	0

what	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
advocate	1
more	0
taxes	0
or	0
better	0
management	0
of	0
what	0
they	0
got	0

like	1
if	0
the	0
teachers	1
are	0
getting	0
six	0
percent	0
raises	1
every	0
year	1
when	0
people	0
in	0
industry	1
have	0

get	0
down	0
to	0

parent	1
level	0
and	0
and	0

have	0
to	0
send	0
your	0
child	0
to	0
a	0
bad	0
school	1
who	0
knows	0
bu[t]	0
maybe	1
we	0
do	0
we	0
need	0
some	0
more	0
Catholic	1
schools	1
support	0
the	0
church	0
instead	0
they	0
seem	0
to	0
have	0
done	1
a	0
the	0
good	1
job	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
in	0
uh	0
some	1
places	0
uh	0
you	0
couldn't	1
go	1
to	0
a	0
public	0
school	1
it	0
was	0
miles	1
down	0
the	0
road	1
and	0
the	0
only	0
school	1
you	0
could	1
go	0
to	0
was	0
the	0
Baptist	1
school	0
or	0
the	0
Catholic	1
school	0
so	0

yeah	0
they're	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
strict	0

yeah	0
the	0
i	0
don't	0

you	0
uh	0
have	0
to	0
learn	0
you	0
aren't	0
given	1
the	0
chance	0
to	0
you	0
know	0
screw	1
off	0
all	0
the	0
time	0

yeah	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	0
would	0
do	1
that	0
to	0
my	0
[laughter-child]	1
[laughter-though]	1
but	0
so	0
hum	0
pretty	0
much	0
though	0
see	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
any	0
good	0
ideas	1
or	0
or	0
anything	1
that	0
would	0
contribute	1
see	0
this	1
isn't	0
a	0
subject	1
that	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	0
about	1
because	1
i'm	0
never	1
faced	1
with	0
it	0
because	0
our	0
school	1
system	0
in	0
Vermont	1
it	0
seems	1
to	0
do	0
a	0
really	0
good	0
job	1

well	1
i	1
know	0
i'm	1
in	0
the	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
only	1
reason	0
i	0
asked	0
about	0
secondary	1
schools	0
or	0
you	0
know	0
advanced	1
education	1
is	0
because	0
down	0
here	1
you	0
know	0
going	1
to	0
the	0
University	1
of	0
Texas	1
the	0
education	0
i'm	1
getting	0
i	0
think	1
is	0
kind	0
of	0
shoddy	1
for	0
a	0
public	1
school	1

is	0
it	0

i	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i'm	0
getting	1
what	0
i	0
should	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
Texas	1
it's	0
next	1
to	0
free	1
because	0
th[ey]	0
they	0
pay	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
it	0
it's	0
state	0
supported	0

well	0
that	0

but	0
at	0
the	0
same	1
time	1
it's	0
really	1
not	1
it's	0
not	1
like	0
going	0
to	0
MIT	1
my	1
engineering	0
degree	0
will	0
be	0
nothing	1
like	0
somebody	1
coming	0
out	0
of	0
MIT	1
and	0
that's	1
it's	0
really	1
too	0
bad	1

well	0

but	0
that's	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
just	0
builds	1
on	0
the	0
foundation	1
that	0
they've	0
already	0
built	1
you	0
get	1
people	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
schools	0
and	0
col[lege]	1
junior	1
colleges	0
that	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
background	1
for	0
an	0
MIT	0
kind	0
of	0
curriculum	1
so	0

so	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
lesser	1
engineering	0
school	0
we	0
have	1
a	0
very	1
good	0
public	1
school	0
up	0
here	1
and	1
a	0
degree	1
out	0
there	0
means	1
a	0
lot	1
it's	0
a	0
very	1
good	1
school	1
it's	0
it's	0
University	1
of	0
Vermont	1

some	0
two	1

well	1
there's	0
a	0
four	1
year	0
colleges	0
they	0
all	1
have	0
a	0
pretty	1
good	0
reputation	1
but	0
like	0
you	0
say	0

tha[t]	1
the	0
topic	1
is	1

i	0
get	1
some	0
spare	1
time	0
here	1
and	0
there	1
i'll	0
work	0

um	0
but	0
it's	0
not	0

very	0
good	0
topic	1
it	0

like	0
if	0
you	0

not	0
when	0
you're	0
n[either]	0
neither	0
one	1

done	1
especially	1
like	0
needlepoint	1

uh-huh	0

needlepoint	0
cushions	1
and	0
things	1

yeah	0

but	1
it	0
just	0
seems	1
like	0
there'd	0
be	0
so	1
much	0
time	1
involved	0
in	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
and	0
that	0
the	0
petty	1
point	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	0
it's	0

yeah	0

it's	0
like	0
God	1
it	0
j[ust]	0
just	0
seems	1
like	0
it's	0
easier	1
just	0
to	0
go	1
out	0
and	0
buy	1
it	0
[laughter-already]	0
[laughter-made]	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
wh[at]	0
what	0
is	0
it's	0
like	0
there	1
but	0
here	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
country	1
stuff	0
is	0
in	1
you	0
know	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
woodwork	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
uh	0
stenciling	1

yeah	0

and	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
to	0
any	0
like	0
a	0
flea	0
market	0
and	0
stuff	0
and	0
there's	1
just	0
tons	1
of	0
stuff	0
everywhere	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
people	0
just	0
do	0
it	0
in	0
their	0
garage	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
then	0
on	0
weekends	0
they	0
go	0
out	1
and	0
sell	0
it	1
and	0
during	0
the	0
week	1
they	0
go	0
back	0
and	0
do	0
some	0
more	1

and	0
see	0
they	1
do	0
that	1
as	0
their	0
job	1
whereas	0
you	0
know	0
for	0
us	0
i[t]	0
and	0

right	1

and	0
they	1
make	1
it	1
cheaper	1
for	0
us	0
to	0
[laughter-buy]	1

yeah	1
definitely	0

so	0
but	1
and	0
i	0
i	1
mean	0
i'm	1
sure	0
it	0
must	1
be	0
relaxing	1
to	0
do	0
things	1
like	0
that	0
because	1
i	1
can	0
remember	1
when	0
i	0
used	0
to	0
do	1
you	0
know	0
those	0
little	1
salt	1
dough	0
figurines	1
and	1
things	0
it	0
was	0
it	1
was	0
relaxing	1
you	0
know	0
creative	1
you	1
felt	1
very	1
creative	1

um-hum	0

but	1
it	1
just	0
was	0
so	0
time	1
time	1
involved	1
you	0
know	1
so	0
much	0
time	0
involved	1
and	1
the	0
different	1
steps	1
and	0
things	0

yeah	0

um-hum	0

so	1
and	0

okay_1	1
well	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	0
we're	0
okay	1
i	0
think	0
we	0
did	0
done	0
five	1
minutes	0
so	0
we	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
keep	0
talking	1
about	0
[laughter-nothing]	1
[laughter-anymore]	0

yeah	0
[laughter-so]	0

okay	1
well	0
thank	1
you	0

okay	1
i	0
hope	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
good	0
rest	1
of	0
your	0
weekend	0

thanks	1
bye-bye	0

[laughter-okay]	0
bye-bye	0

okay	1
do	1
you	1
vote	1
regular	1

yeah	1
i	1
do	0
i	1
try	0
and	0
vote	1
in	0
every	1
single	0
election	1

every	1
one	1

but	1
uh	0
that's	0
just	1
since	1
in	0
the	1
past	0
say	1
about	1
six	0
years	1
before	1
that	0
i	0
really	0
didn't	0
pay	0
any	0
attention	1
at	0
all	1

well	1
see	0
that's	0
me	1
i've	0
never	0
paid	1
any	0
attention	1
to	0
voting	1

oh	1
you	1
haven't	0

hum-um	0

yeah	0
i	0
didn't	1
use	0
to	0
but	0
now	0
i	0
really	0
because_1	0
i	0
get	0
so	1
angry	0
about	0
what	0
goes	0
on	0
and	0
then	0
i	0
feel	1
like	0
i	0
can't	1
really	0
complain	1
too	0
much	0
unless	1

unless	1
you	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	0

yeah	0

right	1

but	0
the	0
problem	1
is	0
that	1
i	0
am	1
very	1
liberal	1
politically	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
hardly	1
ever	1
have	0
anybody	1
that	0
wins	1
that	0
i	1
[laughter-vote]	1
[laughter-for]	1

oh	1
liberal	1
by	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
liberal	1
um	0

liberal	0
politically	0
i'm	0
you	0
know	0
like	0
pretty	0
left	0
wing	0
Demo[crat]	0
Democrat	0
so	0

well	0
see	1
i	0
don't	1
know	1
anything	0
about	0
politics	1

oh	1
you	0
don't	1

uh	1
what's	0
the	0
main	1
what's	1
the	1
main	0
difference	0
between	1
Republicans	0
and	0
Democrats	1

okay	0
well	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them_1	1
um	0
[de]pends	0
on	0
what	0
issue	1
you're	0
talking	0
about	1
but	0
Democrats	0
are	0
on	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
issues	0
are	0
more	0
liberal	0
than	1
Republicans	1
and	0
well	0
it	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1
to	0
say	1
now	1
especially	0
after	0
Desert	1
Storm	1
but	1
um	1
i	0
think	1
back	1
in	1
the	0
eigh[ties]	1
times	1
when	0
uh	0
my	1
political	0
opinions	1
were	0
being	1
formed	0
like	0
in	0
Viet[nam]	1
during	1
the	0
Vietnam	1
war	0
and	0
stuff	1
the	0
Republicans	1
were	1
more	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
they	0
called	0
Hawks	1
which	0
is	0
more	1
like	0
aggressive	1
in	0
war	1
and	0
more	0
pro-war	1
and	0
pro-aggression	1
and	1

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
um	0
the	0
Democrats	1
were	1
the	0
doves	1
they	0
were	1
more	1
for	0
peace	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
how	1
much	0
that	0
holds	1
true	0
anymore	1
i	1
think	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
issues	1
are	0

okay	1
and	1
you	1
vote	1
for	1
the	0
Democrats	1
or	0

yeah	0

usually	0

yeah	0
and	0
Democrats	0
usually	0
are	0
su[pportive]	0
more	0
supportive	0
of	0
public	0
assistance	0
programs	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
and	0
programs	0
to	0
um	0
th[e]	0
the	0
big	1
Republican	1
thing	0
is	0
that	0
they	0
don't	1
they	0
vote	1
for	0
less	0
government	1
they	0
want	0
less	1

a	0
woman	1
that	0
was	0
running	1
for	0

a	0
while	1
Ferraro	0

Ferraro	0
that	0
was	1
a	0
while	0

that	0
was	1
a	0
couple	0
elections	1
ago	0
yeah	0

[laughter-okay]	0

yeah	0
that's	1
okay	0

well	1
well	1
that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
like	0
i	0
didn't	1
know	1
what	0
the	0
difference	1
between	0
Dukakis	1
and	0
Bush	0
was	1

um-hum	0

you	0
know	1
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
anything	1
about	0
Bush	1
or	0
Dukakis	1

so	1
what	0
do	1
you	0
think	1
about	1
uh	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
about	1
what	0
you	0
see	1
on	0
TV	1
about	0
them_1	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
news	1
or	0
on	0
the	0
ads	1
do	1
you	1
kind	1
of	0
just	1

okay	0
i	0
don't	0
remember	1
anything	0
about	0
Dukakis	1

you	0
don't	0

but	1
well	0
they're	0
all	1
saying	0
that	0
they're	0
going	1
to	0
do	1
you	0
know	1
whatever	0
is	0
best	1
for	0
their	0
campaign	1
anyway	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
if	0
they	0
had	1
some	0
kind	0
of	0
public	0
programs	1
where	0
you	0
can	0
just	0
go	0
out	1
and	0

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
like	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
school	0
they	1
didn't	0
teach	1
you	0
about	1
Demo[crats]	1
uh	0
the	0
government	1
not	0
really	1

right	0

you	0
didn't	1
get	0
any	0
government	0
classes	1

hum-um	0

yeah	0
it's	0
really	1
hard	1
too	0
because	0
before	1
they	0
used	0
to	0
have	1
um	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
the	0
stuff	1
that	0
they	0
put	0
out	0
now	1
it	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
doesn't	1
just	0
seem	1
like	1
it	0
i	0
know	0
for	0
a	0
fact	1
that	0
the	1
any	1
kind	0
of	0
stuff	1
that	0
if	0
you	1
wrote	1
and	0
asked	1
for	0
material	1
well	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
believe	1
in	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
believe	1
in	1
they	0
don't	0
take	1
any	0
stands	0
on	0
anything	1
they	0
kind	0
of	0
say	1
well	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
want	1
me	0
to	0
believe	1

yeah	0

or	0
they	0
word	1
it	0
so	0
that	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	1
to	0
tell	1
where	0
they're	0
standing	1
on	0
certain	0
issues	1

well	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
they're	0
yeah	0
i	0
know	0
how	1
they	0
do	0
it	1
it	0

um-hum	0

it	0
like	0
i[t]	0
with	0
the	0
abortion	0
issues	0
and	0
stuff	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
kind	0
of	0
take	0
a	0
stand	1
on	0
some	1
things	0
like	0
abortion	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
so	0
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
how	1
i	1
judge	1
there's	0
a	0
few	1
things	1
where	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
say	0
yes	1
or	0
no	1
like	0
abortion	1
or	0
gun	1
control	1
or	0
let	0
me	0
see	0
i	0
try	0
to	0
look	1
at	0
what	1
if	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
newspaper	1
articles	1
or	0
the	1
i	0
don't	0
trust	1
TV	1
as	0
much	1
but	0
newspaper	1
articles	1
can	1
show	1
wheth[er]	0
how	0
they	0
voted	1
in	0
the	0
past	1
and	0
but	0
you	0
get	0
you	0
know	0
it	0

right	0

it	0
all	0
depends	1
again	1
on	0
whose	0
writing	1
it	0
and	0
who	1
they're	0
for	1
because	0
they	0
can	0
slant	1
that	0
too	1

right	0
and	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
poli[ticians]	0
the	0
politicians	0
i'm	0
the	0
also	1
the	0
politicians	1
put	0
out	1
what	0
makes	1
them_1	0
look	0
good	0
anyway	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
everybody's	1
got	1
you	0
know	1
stuff	1
they	0
don't	1
want	0
known	1

right	0
everybody's	1
got	1
a	1
secret	1
so	0

well	0
anyway	1
i'm	0
sorry	1
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	1
have	1
much	1
knowledge	1

well	0
that's	0
okay	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
um	0

i	0
don't	0
even	0
remember	0
this	1
being	0
on	0
there	1

i	0
mean	1
what	0
would	1
it	0
take	1
like	1
that	1
this	1
is	0
really	0
good	1
actually	1
tha[t]	0
for	1
to	0
talk	1
to	0
somebody	1
who	0
hasn't	0
voted	1
i	0
mean	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0

incentive	0

how	0
would	0
it	1
how	1
what	0
kind	1
of	0
stuff	1
would	0
they	1
would	0
you	1
like	0
them	0
to	0
do	1
so	0
that	1
that	1
you	0
would	1
know	0
more	1
about	0
it	1
like	0
send	0
stuff	0
in	0
the	0
mail	0
or	0
have	0
it	0
at	0
the	0
library	0
or	0

i	0
guess	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
good	0
now	0
i'm	0
sure	1
they've	0
got	0
it	0
at	0
the	0
library	1
you	1
know	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0
if	0
i	0
get	0
to	0
the	0
library	1
i've	0
got	1
two	0
babies	1
so	0
i	0
don't	0
yeah	0

oh	0
do	0
you	0
yeah	0
that'll	0
tie	1
you	0
down	0
a	0
little	0
bit	1

but	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0

or	0
do	0
you	1
just	0
not	1
do	0
you	0
feel	1
like	0
it's	1
not	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
make	1
that	0
much	0
difference	1
if	0
you	0
don't	0
vote	1
or	0

oh	0
i	0
know	1
if	0
enough	0
people	1
think	0
like	0
that	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
would	0
make	1
a	0
difference	0
if	0
people	1
stopped	0
thinking	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

yeah	0

um	0
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
they'll	0
vote	1
the	0
way	1
their	0
family	1
votes	0
you	0
know	1
if	0

uh-huh	0

if	0
since	0
you're	1
what	0
Democrat	1
th[en]	1
then	1
like	0
your	0
kids	1
or	0
whatever	0
will	0
follow	0
you	1
and	0
just	0
vote	0
Democrat	1
right	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

right	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0

well	0
not	0
in	0
my	0
[laughter-family]	0

no	0

we're	0
kind	1
of	0
really	1
independent	1

all	0
split	0

but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
families	0
do	0
that	1
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
wives	1
feel	1
like	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
vote	1
the	0
way	0
that	0
their	0
husbands	0
vote	1

right	0

and	0
that	0
kind	1
of	0
keeps	1
from	0
getting	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
issues	1
resolved	1
golly	0

i	0
lie	0
hm	0

but	0
well	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	1
did	1
understand	0
politics	1
i	0
probably	1
would	0
vote	0
more	1

um-hum	0

but	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
if	0
i	0
voted	0
for	0
Bush	0
or	0
like	1
when	0
uh	0
Gary	1
Hart	1
was	0
running	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	0
would	0
have	0
voted	1
for	0
him	1
just	0
because	1
he	0
was	0
nicer	0
looking	1
not	0

Hart	0

uh-huh	0

not	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
was	0
good	0
looking	0
but	0
he	0
was	0
young	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

and	0
then	1
i	0
didn't	1
think	0
that	1
was	0
right	1
because	0
he	0
may	1
have	0
been	0
a	0
good	0
president	1
or	0
whatever	1

um-hum	0

but	0
because	0
it	0
was	0
he	0
had	0
an	0
affair	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
it	0
just	1
threw	0
him	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
whole	1
running	0

yeah	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
go	1
by	0
their	1
uh	0
personal	1
life	0
when	0
they	0
vote	1
and	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

which	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
got	0
turmoil	1
in	0
your	1
personal	1
life	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
let	1
it	0
come	1
into	0
work	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
that	0
have	1
had	0

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
everybody	0
does	0
it	0
just	0
depends	1
on	0
how	0
well	1
you	0
can	0
hide	1
it	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i	0
that's	0
very	0
true	0
i	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
doesn't	1
really	0
have	1
that	0
much	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
um	0
unless	1
they've	0
done	1
something	0
really	0
horrible	1
you	0
know	1
or	0
something	1
real	0
abnormal	1

well	0

criminal	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that's	0
different	0
but	0

yeah	0
right	0

but	0
if	0
him	1
and	0
his	0
wife	1
weren't	0
getting	0
along	1
i	0

but	0
otherwise	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	1
what	0
is	1
what	1
effect	0
does	0
that	0
have	1
on	0
him	0
running	1
for	0
president	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1

yeah	0
yeah	0

it's	0
all	0
so	0
secretive	0
see	0
we	0
really	1
don't	0
see	1
the	0
true	1
person	1
anyway	0

that's	0
right	0

i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	0
having	1
a	0
big	1
effect	0
on	0
how	1
poorly	1
that	0
the	0
country's	1
being	0
run	1
is	0
that	1
um	0
the	1
the	0
election	1
the	0
people	1
that	0
want	0
to	1
get	0
elected	1
are	0
turning	1
it	0
into	0
a	0
popularity	1
contest	1
by	0
advertising	1
the	0
things	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
that	0
really	1
don't	0
have	0
anything	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
how	0
well	1
they	0
do	0
the	0
job	1

right	0

but	0
see	0
they're	0
trying	1
to	1
find	0
an	1
excuse	1
not	0
to	0
deal	0
with	1
what	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
issues	1
that	0
people	1
really	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
about	1
because	1
on	0
those	0
issues	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
say	0
yes	1
or	0
no	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
don't	1
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	1
then	1
maybe	0
somebody'll	1
vote	1
for	0
them_1	0
that	0
wouldn't	1
have	1
if	0
they	0
had	0
come	1
down	0
on	0
the	0
wrong	0
side	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
so	0

right	0

so	0
they	0
just	0
try	0
and	0
make	0
it	0
a	0
personal	0
thing	0
i	0
mean	0
if	0
you	1
remember	1
any	1
of	0
the	0
TV	0
commercials	1
from	0
the	0
last	1
presidential	0
campaign	1
they	0
all	0
had	1
uh	0
pictures	1
of	0
Bush	1
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
walking	1
around	0
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
and	1
even	0
from	0
Reagan	1
it	0
was	0
all	1
just	0
like	1
looks	1
like	0
a	0
McDonald's	1
commercial	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	0

that's	1
[laughter-about]	0
what	0
it	0
looked	1
like	0

well	1
what	0
did	1
you	0
think	1
of	0
Reagan	0
as	0
a	0
president	1

i	0
just	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
really	0
inept	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
he	0
did	0
anything	1
at	0
all	1
he	1
they	0
just	1
kind	0
of	0
sat	1
him	0
up	0
there	1
like	0
a	0
puppet	1
and	0
the	0
people	0
that	0
were	0

do	0
you	0
think	1
he	0
won	1
from	0
Carter	1
because	1
of	0
the	1
um	0
the	1
hostages	1
that	0
were	0
held	1
at	0
that	0
time	1

well	0
i	1
think	0
that	0
was	1
part	1
of	0
it	1
i	0
think	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
the	0
the	0
economic	0
problems	0
that	0
the	0
country	1
was	0
having	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
the	0
the	0
recession	0
and	0
stuff	0
people	1

um-hum	0

people	1
just	0
had	0
a	0
picture	0
of	0
Carter	1
as	0
not	0
being	0
real	0
capable	1
but	0
he	0
actually	0
all	0
right	0
[laughter-this]	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	0

i	0
thought	1
Carter	0
was	0
good	0
too	1
and	0
that	0
was	0
yeah	0

did	0
you	0
i	0
always	0
liked	0
him	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
couldn't	1
get	0
over	1
the	0
fact	0
that	0
Reagan	1
beat	0
him	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
i	0
just	1
couldn't	0
believe	1
that	0
he	1
got	0
voted	0
out	1

but	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
wasn't	0
well	0
let's	0
see	0
that's	0
been	0
about	1
ten	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

okay	0
so	0
i	0
was	0
only	0
fifteen	1
or	0
sixteen	1
but	0
i	0
remember	0
Carter	0
and	0
i	0
liked	0
him	0

you	0
did	0
have	0
you	0
heard	1
stuff	0
about	0
him	0
lately	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
he's	1
doing	1

no	0
i	0
sure	0
don't	0

well	0
he	1
is	0
just	1
he	0
is	0
really	1
active	0
still	0
politically	1
he's	0
been	0
overseas	0
you	0
remember	1
when	0
he	1
was	0
in	0
office	1
he	0
did	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
stuff	1
for	0
the	0
Middle	1
Ea[st]	0
for	1
pe[ople]	0

you	1
wanna	1
go	1
first	1

no	1
you	1
can	1
start	1

okay	1
um	0
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	0
they	1
talked	1
about	1
was	1
uh	0
did	1
we	1
di[d]	0
wha[t]	0
do	1
what	1
do	0
we	0
think	1
about	0
a	0
judge	1
making	0
the	0
decision	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
really	1
don't	0
agree	1
with	0
that	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	1
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
is	0
better	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
than	1
e[ven]	0
having	1
a	0
unanimous	1
decision	1
rather	1
than	0
to	1
have	0
one	0
person	1
be	0
responsible	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
that	1
they	0
could	0
be	1
objective	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
every	1
time	1

right	1

y[ou]	0
you	0
know	1
what	0
i	0
mean	1

right	1
there's	1
there	1
th[is]	0
thi[s]	1
this	1
topic	0
is	0
kind	0
of	0
moot	1
um	0
there	1

yeah	1

there	1
there's	0
no	0
way	1
we	1
we	1
couldn't	0
survive	1
in	0
a	1
sy[stem]	0
in	1
a	0
in	0
a	0
juror	1
syst[em]	0
in	0
a	0
trial	1
system	1
without	1
a	0
jury	1

right	1

um	1
one	1
man	0
can	0
never	1
be	0
one	1
man	1
one	0
woman	1
can	0
never	1
be	0
objectionable	1
in	0
every	1
case	0

that's	0
it	1

um	1
every	1
person	0
has	1
their	0
opinions	1
and	1
that's	1
why	1
jury	1
selection	1
is	0
often	1
very	0
difficult	1
um	1

well	0
i	1
i	0
feel	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
too	1
uh	0
they	1
were	0
saying	1
uh	1
you	1
know	0
what	1
new	1
ways	1
could	1
you	0
could	1
it	0
you	1
you	1
know	0
change	1
the	0
system	1
i	1
i	0
really	1
think	1
that	1
um	1
we	1
spend	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
time	1
uh	1
going	1
through	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
i	0

i	0
mean	0
i[f]	1
if	0
you	1
go	1
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
and	0
especially	1
if	0
a	0
person	1
has	1
confessed	1
if	0
they	1
have	1
been	0
caught	1
you	1
know	0
point	1
blank	1
in	1
the	0
crime	1
there's	1
uh	0
no	1
question	1
it's	0

right	1

it's	0
beyond	1
a	0
reasonable	1
doubt	1
you	0
all	1
these	0
things	1
i	1
mean	0
you	1
know	1
we've	1
gone	1
through	0
this	1
uh	0
over	1
and	0
over	1
again	0

right	1
they	0
shouldn't	0
allow	1
an	0
appeal	1

and	1
it	1
can	1
go	0
on	1
for	1
ten	1
twenty	1
years	0

yep	1

i	1
i	1
think	1
this	0
is	0
a	1
little	1
ridiculous	1

[laughter-um-hum]	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
only	1
people	0
who	1
benefit	1
from	0
that	1
are	0
the	0
lawyers	1

no	1
that's	0
right	1
i	1
work	1
for	0
a	0
law	1
firm	1
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-ought]	0

i	1
i'm	0
serious	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
lawyers	1
have	0
caused	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
problems	1
tha[t]	1
ha[ppen]	0
that	1
exist	1
in	1
the	0
in	0
the	0
criminal	1
system	0
today	1
with	1
plea	1
bargaining	1

right	1

you	1
know	0
if	0
someone	1
is	0

well	1
plea	1
bar[gaining]	1
plea	1
bargaining	1
is	0
a	0
different	0
story	1

well	1

plea	1
bargaining	1
is	0
something	0
completely	0
different	1
that	1
that	1
actually	0
prevents	1
trials	0
or	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
speeds	1
them_1	0
up	1

well	1
i	0
know	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	1
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
all	1
of	0
the	0
whole	0
criminal	1
system	1
is	0
messed	1
up	1
in	0
in	0
that	1
regard	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
know	1
people	1
who	0
commit	1
uh	0
crimes	1
that	0
they	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	1
it	0
works	1
exactly	1
but	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	0
lesser	1
sentences	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
understand	0
that	0
the	0
jails	1
are	0
full	0
of	0
people	1
you	0
know	1
uh	1
and	0
that	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
do	0
something	1

right	1

but	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
reason	1
they	0
are	1
full	0
is	0
because	1
they	0
know	1
that	0
they	1
can	0
get	0
away	1
with	0
it	0

hum	1

you	0
you	1
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
tha[t]	0
we	0
we	1
don't	0
have	1
um	1
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
states	0
don't	1
have	0
capital	0
punishment	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
i	1
think	1
they	0
should	1

we	1
do	0

i	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
if	0
a	0
person	1
is	0
guilty	1
of	0
taking	1
someone's	0
life	1
and	0
like	0
you	0
say	1
it's	0
it's	0
there's	0
no	1
doubt	1
whatsoever	0
like	0
drunk	0
drivers	1
that	0
kill	1
people	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
all	1

right	1

they	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	1
i	0
i	1
just	0
think	1
that	0
that's	1
they've	0
they've	1
taken	1
a	0
life	1
and	0
if	1
they	1
should	0
pay	1
for	0
it	0
with	0
their	1
life	1

right	1
when	0
you're	0
saying	1
as	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	0
appeal	1
um	1
procedure	1
is	0
concerned	1

yeah	1

we	1
just	0
have	0
the	0
case	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
you've	0
probably	0
heard	1
of	0
Marion	1
Berry	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
his	1
fi[nal]	0
his	0
last	1
appeal	1
was	1
was	0
denied	1
two	1
days	0
before	0
his	0
sentence	1
was	0
up	1

oh	0
really	1

so	1
i	0
mean	1
his	0
appeal	1
was	0
denied	1
and	0
two	1
days	0
later	0
he	0
got	0
out	0
of	0
jail	1
for	0
cocaine	1
possession	1

it	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	0
um	0
that	1
was	0
absurd	1
there	0
was	0
no	0
there	1
was	0
no	0
reason	0
the	0
appeal	1
process	0
should	0
have	0
dragged	1
on	0
that	0
long	0
for	0
a	0
six	1
month	0
sentence	1

i	1
know	0
that	1
the	1

uh-huh	1
an[d]	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
wha[t]	0
what	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
to	1
change	1
it	1
to	0
make	1
it	0
better	1

well	1
uh	0
the	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	0
can	1
i	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
the	1
the	0
appeal	1
procedure	1
is	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	1
can	0
possibly	0
think	1
of	0
um	1
i	0
like	1
i	0
said	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
removing	1
of	0
the	0
jury	1
and	0
having	1
the	0
judge	1
sentence	0
that's	1
absurd	1
there's	1
no	0
way	0
that	1
could	0
work	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
don't	0
agree	1
with	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	1
but	1

imagine	1
the	0
guilt	1
that	0
person	0
would	0
have	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
burned	1
out	1

oh	0
exactly	1

is	1
there's	0
no	0
possible	1
way	1
that	0
you	1
could	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
feel	0
good	1
about	0
yourself	1

exactly	1

right	1

if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
do	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
day	1
after	0
day	1

no	1
one	0
would	0
want	1
the	0
job	1

no	1
rea[lly]	1
not	1
really	1

um	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
like	0
i	1
said	1
the	0
you	0
know	1
everyone	1
has	0
their	0
opinions	1
about	0
every	0
case	1

well	0
wou[ld]	1
do	0
you	1
think	0
people	1
should	0
have	1
a	1
trial	1
if	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	1
like	1

oh	1
yeah	0
i	0
i	0
feel	0
that	0
everyone	1
is	0
everyone	1
is	0
um	1
entitled	1
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
that	1
that	1
that	0
right	1
sh[ould]	0

i	1
mean	0
supposing	1
i	1
come	0
up	0
to	0
you	1
and	0
i	0
just	0
point	1
blank	1
kill	1
you	0

well	1
i	0
mean	1
were	0
there	0
witnesses	1

in	0
other	1
words	1
you're	0
saying	1
that	0
we	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
whether	0
it's	0
premeditated	1
or	1
what	1
the	0
circumstances	1
were	1

right	1

right	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
you	0
can't	1
remove	0
the	0
jury	1
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
case	1

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
you	1
could	0
have	0
fifty	1
people	1
in	0
audience	1
watching	1
a	0
murder	1
take	0
place	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
you	1
you'd	0
still	1
there's	0
still	1
mitigating	0
circumstances	1

well	0
it's	0
i	1
i	1
feel	0

you	1
want	1
to	1
start	1

well	1
i	1
guess	1
i	1
would	1
first	1
identify	1
myself	0
as	1
middle	0
aged	1
and	0
therefore	1
having	1
seen	1
the	1
last	0
generation	1
i	1
guess	1
it	0
puts	1
me	1
in	0
you	1
know	0
gives	1
me	1
a	0
perspective	1
on	0
that	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

um	1
i	1
am	0
quite	1
positive	1
on	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
i	0
have	0
seen	0
happen	1
recently	0
relative	1
to	0
women	1
in	1
both	1
in	0
society	1
and	0
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
uh	0
there's	0
no	1
doubt	0
about	1
the	0
fact	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
f[irst]	0
was	1
first	1
graduated	1
from	1
college	1
the	1
impression	1
was	1
that	1
a	1
woman's	1
career	1
would	0
consist	1
of	0
a	0
childbearing	1
years	1
and	0
perhaps	1
a	1
return	1
to	1
the	0
office	1
but	0
not	1
necessarily	1
uh	1
now	1
i	0
think	0
the	1
change	1
that	1
i've	1
seen	0
as	1
much	1
as	0
anything	1
is	1
one	1
where	1
couples	1
uh	0
are	0
more	0
carefully	1
planning	1
their	0
intention	1
on	0
how	1
to	0
sh[are]	0
both	0
share	1
homemaking	0
duties	1
and	0
also	1
how	0
women	1
will	0
uh	0
have	1
their	0
children	1
and	0
then	0
deliberately	1
sort	0
of	0
plan	1
how	0
they	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
work	1
place	0

i	0

and	0
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
a	0
significant	1
change	0
that	0
of	0
i've	1
both	0
participated	1
in	0
an[d]	0
and	0
noticed	1

i	0
agree	1
um	0
the	0
equality	1
of	1
uh	1
the	1
roles	1
now	1
between	0
the	0
sexes	1
i	0
guess	1
has	0
been	1
dramatically	1
demonstrated	1
with	1
this	1
war	1
especially	1
compared	1
with	1
uh	1
the	0
Vietnam	1
war	0
and	0
you	0
see	1
women	1
going	1
off	0
to	0
wars	1
as	0
well	1
as	0
men	1

uh-huh	1

um	0
i	1
have	0
wondered	1
why	1
they	1
allowed	1
or	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
both	1
the	0
father	1
and	0
mother	1
go	1
uh	0
and	1
the	0
children	1
are	0
left	1
without	0
either	1
parent	1
now	0
to	0
me	1
that's	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
drawback	1
but	0
uh	0
i	1
guess	1
it's	1
a	0
price	1
you	1
pay	1
and	0
i	0
also	1
wonder	1
about	0
the	0
children	1
that	0
are	0
being	1
brought	0
up	1
in	1
the	0
uh	0
uh	0
day	1
care	0
centers	1

wonder	1
about	1
them	0
in	1
what	0
way	1

well	1
uh	1
from	0
what	1
i	0
understand	1
there's	0
been	0
studies	1
that	1
uh	1
these	0
children	1
are	1
uh	0
more	1
rebellious	1
uh	1
they	1
term	1
it	0
as	1
more	1
uh	1
creative	1
but	1
uh	0
that	0
they	1
uh	0
are	0
much	1
more	0
contentious	1

uh-huh	1

so	1
i	1
i	1
don't	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
we'll	0
have	0
to	0
see	1
another	0
generation	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
differences	1
a	0
child	1
being	0
brought	1
up	0
you	1
know	1
in	0
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	0
a	1
uh	0
community	1
rather	1
than	0
a	0
home	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
have	1
not	1
to	0
be	0
honest	1
had	1
much	0
experience	1
with	0
children	1
in	0
that	0
situation	1
i	1

yeah	1

i	1
i	0
guess	1
one	0
knows	1
one's	1
own	0
story	1
and	0
i	0
know	1
uh	0
in	0
my	1
children's	0
case	1
it	0
was	1
one	0
where	1
uh	0
pretty	1
much	0
up	0
until	1
the	0
older	1
of	0
two	1
was	1
in	1
uh	0
let's	1
see	1
i	0
guess	1
basically	1
starting	1
junior	0
high	1
and	0
the	1
younger	1
was	0
in	0
fifth	1
grade	0
when	0
my	0
wife	1
reentered	0
the	1
work	1
force	0

uh-huh	0

um	1

so	0
they	1

so	0
i	0
guess	1
my	0
experience	1
is	0
is	0
just	1
with	0
what	0
we	1
did	0
and	1
and	0
so	0
they	0
didn't	1
really	0
go	0
through	0
the	0
child	1
care	0
route	0
they	0

yeah	1

they	0
were	0
able	1
to	0
be	0
home	1
together	1
um	0
and	0
we	0
never	1
actually	0
experienced	1
that	0
what	1
in	0
terms	1
of	0
changes	1
relative	1
to	0
women	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
and	0
and	0
potential	1
changes	0
over	1
the	0
the	0
next	1
generation	1
or	0
so	0
i	0
guess	0
i	1
anticipate	1
um	0
an	0
increasing	1
equality	1
uh	0
greater	1
presence	0
of	0
women	0
in	0
management	1
roles	0

um-hum	1
uh-huh	1

um	0
i	0
don't	1
know	1
whether	1
there	0
will	0
be	1
an	0
increased	1
amount	1
of	0
of	0
surrogacy	1
that	0
we	0
see	1
i	0
just	1
don't	0
know	1

what	1
do	0
you	0
mean	1

um	1
deliberate	1
childbirth	1
by	0
surrogate	1
mother	1

oh	1
yeah	1

sort	0
of	0
rent	1
a	0
mom	1
to	0
be	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
to	1
be	0
crass	1
about	0
it	0
but	1
uh	1
uh	0
whether	1
one	0
might	0
conceive	1
no	0
pun	0

there	0
might	1

a	0
kind	1

a	0
deliberate	1
uh	0
um	0
a	0
professional	1
mother	1
a	0
person	1
for	1
instance	0
that	1

yeah	1

that's	0
strange	1

a	0
nanny	1
sort	1
of	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
i	1
could	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
could	1
envision	1
a	0
society	1
where	0
that	1
would	0
happen	1
and	0
make	0
an	0
interesting	1
uh	0
uh	0
story	1
or	0
whatever	1
i	0

yeah	1

i	0
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	1
have	0
a	0
philosophical	1
problem	1
with	1
that	0
in	0
fact	1
i	1
think	1
it	0
sort	0
of	0
raises	1
nurturing	1
and	0
being	0
a	0
mother	1
to	0
what	0
it	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
which	0
is	0
a	0
respected	1
profession	1

that's	0
right	1
that's	0
right	1

uh	0
um	0
i	0
i	0
don't	1
have	0
a	0
other	1
than	0
than	0
a	0
reading	1
and	0
and	0
male	1
perspective	1
on	0
on	0
the	0
var[ious]	1
on	0
the	0
biological	1
urges	1
involved	1
relative	0
to	0
being	0
a	0
mother	1
or	0
not	1
uh	0
i	0
know	1
that	0
that	0
my	1
sense	0
is	0
that	1
i	0
have	1
very	1
much	0
an	0
interest	1
and	0
had	1
one	0
in	0
being	0
a	0
parent	1
i	0
i	0
don't	1
know	1
that	0
i	1
uh	1
felt	1
myself	1
necessarily	1
encumbered	1
with	0
the	1
necessity	1
to	1
have	1
heirs	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
i	0
don't	1
have	0
boys	1
that	0
doesn't	1
didn't	1
bother	1
me	1
never	0
has	1
vision	1
more	0
women	0
deliberately	1
raising	0
children	1
either	1
in	0
surrogacy	1
or	1
or	1
as	0
a	0
professional	0
nanny	1
nanny	1
as	0
you	1
put	0
it	0
uh	1

yeah	1

maybe	1
we'll	0
see	0
a	0
growth	1
in	0
that	1
where	0
someone	1
makes	1
uh	0
a	0
career	1
out	0
of	0
say	1
taking	1
care	0
of	0
five	1
or	0
six	1
children	1
as	0
opposed	0
to	0
day	0
care	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

it	0
would	0
be	1
a	0
sort	0
of	0
day	1
care	0
but	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
more	1
of	0
a	0
family	0
setting	1

right	1

um	0
i	1
know	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
young	1
people	0
characterized	1
i	0
guess	1
as	0
being	0
half	1
my	0
age	1
so	0
that	0
by	0
definition	1
that	0
means	0
they're	0
young	1
uh	0
that	1
in	0
my	1
work	1
place	1
who	1
are	0
both	1
of	0
them	0
earning	1
rather	0
decent	1
professional	1
salaries	0
who	0
probably	1
would	1
consider	0
paying	1
a	0
woman	1
uh	0
eight	1
or	0
nine	0
or	0
ten	1
thousand	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
to	0
take	1
care	0
of	0
their	0
child	1
i	0

um-hum	1
um-hum	0

to	0
come	1
in	0
and	0
live	1
with	0
them_1	1

i	0
could	0
easily	1
envision	1
that	0
pardon	1

to	0
come	1
in	0
and	0
live	1
with	0
them_1	0

or	0
to	0
put	1
their	1
child	1
into	0
a	0
s[etting]	0
into	1
a	0
home	1
setting	1
where	0
they	1
would	1
you	0
know	1
like	0
they	1
they	0
would	1
get	1
leave	1
at	0
eight	1
in	0
the	0
morning	1
and	1
and	0
drop	1
a	0
two	1
year	0
old	0
off	1
in	0
a	0
home	1
where	0
you	0
knew	1
there	0
were	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
four	1
other	0
kids	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
and	0
you	0
were	1
paying	1
for	0
really	1
high	1
quality	0
care	1

yeah	1

right	1

uh	0
i	0
have	1
acquaintances	1
of	0
mine	1
where	0
i	0
know	1
that	0
they	0
are	1
paying	0
figures	1
on	0
on	0
the	0
order	1
of	0
what	0
i	0
quoted	1
to	0
someone	1
because	0
that's	1
what	0
the	0
experience	1
they	0
want	1
and	0
i	0
would	0
imagine	1
if	0
there	0
are	0
more	1
of	0
people	1
like	0
that	1
with	0
an	0
opportunity	1
that	1
that's	0
a	0
possibility	1
of	0
a	0
change	1
that	0
we	0
could	0
see	1
in	0
the	0
next	0
few	0
years	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
then	0
you	0
might	1
have	0
more	1
control	1
over	0
uh	0
the	0
the	0
morals	1
that	0
they	0
would	0
be	1
taught	1
rather	0
than	1
in	0
like	0
a	0
classroom	1
or	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	1

um-hum	0
um-hum	0

i	0
know	0
the	0
day	1
care	0
centers	1
are	0
not	1
cheap	1
either	1
you	1
know	0
they're	1

i	0
haven't	0
ever	1
really	0
looked	1
at	0
them	0
are	0
you	1
aware	0
at	0
all	1
of	0
of	0
what	1
they	0
would	1
what	0
they	0
cost	1

uh	0
well	1
no	1
i	0

i	0
just	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
several	1
single	1
mothers	1
who	1
absolutely	1
can't	0
afford	1
it	0
they	1
have	0
to	0
go	0
with	1
the	0
a	0
single	1
uh	0
wh[at]	0
i	0
mean	1
a	0
babysitter	1
more	1
more	1
or	0
less	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
like	1
about	0
sixty	1
dollars	1
a	0
week	1
for	1
two	1
children	0
if	0
i'm	0
not	1
mistaken	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
pay	0
that	1
whether	1
you're	0
on	0
vacation	1
you	1
know	0
and	0
taking	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
children	1
or	0
if	0
the	0
children	1
are	0
at	0
home	1
at	0
home	1
sick	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
mean	1
that	1
is	0
you	1
know	0
just	1
a	0
a	0
rate	1
that	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
and	1
uh	0

what	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
envision	1
for	0
the	0
next	0
twenty	0
years	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
women	1
in	0
American	0
society	1

uh	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
really	0
don't	1
have	0
a	0
vision	1

that's	0
okay	1
too	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
i	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
they	0
will	1
be	0
more	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
because	1
uh	0
the	0
door's	1
open	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
it's	0
just	0
human	0
nature	1
to	0
walk	1
through	0
an	0
open	0
door	1
so	1
and	0
i	1
would	0
be	0
glad	1
to	0
see	0
that	1
i	0
hope	1
i	0
don't	0
see	1
a	0
lot	1
more	0
single	1
moms	1
but	1
i	0
it	0
seems	1
in	0
my	1
experience	1
i'm	1
running	0
across	0
single	1
women	0
all	1
the	0
time	1

i'm	1
i'm	0
noticing	1
that	0
too	1
and	0
and	0
i	0
notice	1
the	0
the	1
a	0
terming	1
emerging	0
called	0
solo	1
parents	1
that	0
i	1
am	0
very	1
aware	1
of	0
the	0
number	0
of	0
solo	1
mothers	1
that	1
that	0
i	0
encounter	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
that	1
that	1
is	0
a	0
little	0
troublesome	1
uh	0
because	0
the	0
pressures	1
on	0
them	0
are	1
are	0
rather	1
rather	1
formidable	1

yeah	1
yeah	1

it's	0
awful	1

yeah	1

uh	0
and	0
maybe	1
that's	0
a	0
change	1
we'll	0
see	1
maybe	1
uh	0
p[ossibility]	0
the	0
possibility	1
of	0
of	0
women	1
uh	0
who	0
deliberately	1
say	1
no	1
we'll	0
let	0
the	0
man	1
will	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
the	0
children	1
perhaps	1
in	0
the	0
event	1
of	0
a	0
separation	1
or	0
whatever	1

uh-huh	1

right	1

so	1

well	1
i	0
think	1
we've	0
done	1
it	0

well	1
i	0
think	1
we're	0
about	1
done	0
okay	1

thank	1
you	0
very	0
much	1

was	0
a	0
pre	0
like	0

the	0
quilt	1
i	1

uh-huh	0

i	1
didn't	1

but	0
uh	0

but	1
you	1
actually	1
hand	1
quilted	1
it	0
yourself	1

uh-huh	0
and	0

did	0
did	0
you	0
need	0
a	0
loom	1
or	0
were	0
you	0
a[ble]	0
was	0
it	0
small	1
enough	0
that	0
you	0
could	0
just	0
hold	1
it	0

um	0
i	0
put	1
it	0
on	0
the	0
frame	1
the	0
quilting	1
frame	1
have	0
you	0
are	0
you	0
familiar	1
with	0
that	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
okay	1

but	0
um	0
my	0
again	1
my	1
mother	1
back	1
in	0
Indiana	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
quilting	1
frame	1
in	0
our	0
basement	1
and	0
she	1
would	0
she	1
would	0
quilt	1
whole	0
quilts	1
by	0
herself	1

oh	0
my	0
God	1

um	0
yes	1
which	0
i	0
was	0
always	1
amazed	1
i	0
have	1
one	1
of	0
them_1	0
um	0
but	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
have	1
the	0
quilting	1
frame	1
and	0
then	0
to	0
actually	1
do	1
that	0
it's	0
a	1
tremendous	1
amount	0
of	0
work	1

well	1
i	0
haven't	1
done	0
tons	1
of	0
them_1	0
but	0
um	0
i	0
used	1
to	0
do	0
more	1
before	1
um	0
before	1
i	0
had	0
before	1
we	0
got	0
our	0
baby	1
but	0

have	0
you	0
think	1
children	1
you	1
can	0
um	0
use	0
crafts	1
to	0
make	0
wonderful	1
things	1
for	0
children	1

uh-huh	0

i	0
think	1
when	0
babies	1
i	0
think	0
afghans	1
and	0
and	0
the	0
crocheted	1
little	0
sweaters	1
and	0
are	0
are	0
wonderful	1
and	0
and	0
they'll	0
wear	1
them_1	0

yeah	1
exactly	1

once	0
they	0
get	0
old	1
enough	0
to	0
talk	1
then	0
they	0
no	1
longer	0
will	0
wear	1
[laughter-your]	0

well	0
one	1
thing	0
that	0
i	0
like	0
about	0
this	0
fabric	1
painting	0
thing	0
is	0
i	1
can	0
just	0
make	0
a	0
T-shirt	1
and	0
put	0
a	0
little	0
ruffle	1
around	0
it	0
and	0
then	1
um	0
cut	1
out	0
a	0
little	0
pattern	1
from	1
the	0
material	1
from	0
some	1
material	0
like	0
flowers	1
or	0
something	0
and	0
make	1
um	0
a	0
design	1
or	0
you	1
know	0
a	0
little	0
arrangement	1
or	0
something	1
on	0
the	0
shirt	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
fuse	1
it	0
on	0
with	0
Heat	1
and	0
Bond	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
then	1
paint	1
around	1
it	0
and	0
i	0
usually	1
sew	1
sew	1
around	0
the	0
flower	1
whatever	1
first	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
paint	1
around	1
it	0
so	0
you	0
can't	1
see	0
the	0
stitching	1
as	0
much	0
doe[s]	0
does	0
that	1
make	0
sense	1
to	0
you	0
so	0

oh	0
yes	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
very	0
clever	1
it's	0
uh	0
funny	1
that	0
you	0
said	1
that	0
for	0
Christmas	1
my	0
daughter	1
and	0
i	0
received	1
matching	1
sweat	1
shirts	0
that	0
a	0
friend	1
had	0
made	0
for	0
ours	0
a	0
beautiful	1
Christmas	1
design	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0
they	0
were	0
matching	1
and	0
they	0
were	0
lovely	1
but	1
when	0
i	0
washed	1
them	0
although	0
i	0
took	1
the	0
precaution	1
of	0
turning	1
them	0
inside	0
out	1
i	0
really	1
didn't	0
do	0
anything	0
else	1
and	0
truly	1
everything	1
fell	0
off	1
or	0
most	1
of	0
it	0
so	0

oh	0
sure	1

uh-huh	0

oh	0
really	1

so	0
i	0
ha[d]	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
bought	1
just	0
some	0
cloth	1
glue	1
and	0
glued	1
it	0
all	0
back	1
and	0
i	0
bought	1
the	0
paint	1
and	0
redid	1
most	0
of	0
the	0
edges	1

oh	0

and	0
and	0
it	0
was	0
[laughter-salvageable]	1
and	0
i	0
but	0
it's	0
so	1
i'm	0
familiar	1
with	0
that	0
but	0
i	0
think	1
you're	0
very	0
clever	1
to	0
um	0
sew	1
around	1
the	0
edges	0
i	0
think	0
gluing	1
alone	1
certainly	1
would	0
if	0
you	0
wash	1
it	0
any	0
amount	0
of	0
time	1
it	0
tends	1
to	0
kind	0
of	0
come	0
loose	1
at	0
the	0
edges	1

well	0

yeah	1
someone	1
told	1
me	0
that	0
that	0
it	0
that	0
they	0
had	0
done	1
it	0
both	1
ways	0
and	0
i've	1
always	0
after	1
hearing	1
that	0
i	0
always	0
sewed	1
it	0
on	0
even	1
even	1
with	0
the	0
uh	0
a	0
loose	1
zigzag	1
even	0
helps	1
and	0
um	0

okay	1
so	1
the	0

all	1
right	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
seen	1

so	1
the	0
latest	1
movie	1
i've	1
seen	1
that	1
i	0
thought	1
was	1
fantastic	1
was	1
Dances	1
With	0
Wolves	1

that's	0
i	1
knew	1
you	1
were	0
going	0
to	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
wanted	1
i	0
want	1
to	1
go	0
see	1
that	1

oh	1

i	1
i	1
just	0
finally	1
ended	1
up	0
going	1
to	0
see	1
it	1
uh	0
and	1
one	0
day	1
my	1
husband	1
had	1
the	1
kids	1
and	1
i	1
just	1
went	1
because	1
we	1
couldn't	1
we	0
could	1
never	1
get	1
to	1
go	1
see	1
it	1
together	1
because	0
it's	1
so	1
long	1
by	0
the	0
time	0
we	0
had	0
a	0
babysitter	1
for	0
that	1
[laughter-long]	0

gosh	0

so	1
i	0
finally	1
just	1
went	1
to	0
see	1
it	0
and	1
i	0
just	0
thought	0
it	1
was	1
fantastic	0

yeah	1
i	1
i	1
i	1
i	1
watched	1
uh	0
Costner	1
on	0

really	0
happy	0
that	1

hoping	1
he	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
get	0

quite	0
a	1
the	0
buffalo	1

uh	0
i'm	1
i'm	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	0
see	1
that	1
one	0
that	1
one	1
looks	1
so	1
scary	1
just	1
from	1
the	0
previews	1
i	0

i	0
thought	1
gosh	1
i'd	1
probably	1
have	1
nightmares	1
for	1
the	0
next	1
six	1
months	0

nah	0
nah	1

i	1
know	1
some	0
friends	1
who	1
went	0
to	0
see	1
it	0

yeah	1

they	0
said	0
it	1
was	0
really	0
riveting	1

yeah	0

old	1
[laughter-okay]	0

i	1
thought	1
oh	1
[laughter-man]	1

well	1
i'll	0
tell	0
well	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
i	1
guess	1
it	0
was	0
because	0
i'd	1
read	0
the	0
book	1
before	1
i	0
saw	1
the	0
movie	1

oh	0
uh-huh	0

and	0
the	0
book	0
to	0
me	0
was	0
far	0
more	0
frightening	0
than	0
the	0
movie	0
was	0
yeah	0

oh	1
really	0
huh	0
gosh	0

yeah	0
he's	1
a	0
very	1
good	1
writer	1
and	0
he	0
had	1
a	0
way	1
of	0
putting	1
you	0
in	1
that	0
scene	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
was	0

oh	0
boy	0

yeah	0
and	0
of	0
course	1
i	1
was	0
i	1
was	0
living	1
alone	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
late	0
at	0
night	0
and	0
scary	0
and	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0
you	0
start	1
hearing	1
noises	1
you	0
know	1

[laughter-gosh]	0
call	0
the	0
crisis	0
line	0

yeah	1
i	0
bet	1

and	0
there's	0
rats	1
in	1
the	0
attic	1
you	0
know	0

oh	0
gosh	0

uh	0
let's	0
see	0
there	1
was	0
a	0
couple	1
of	0
others	1
that	0
are	0
out	1
and	0

and	0
i	0
can't	0
remember	0

i	1
saw	0
one	1
i	0
thought	0
was	0
crummy	1
with	0
that	0
new	0
uh	0
Michael	0
J	0
Fox	0
movie	0
The	0
Hard	0
Way	0
where	0
he	0
plays	1
a	0
a	0
actor	1
that's	0
uh	0
like	1
th[e]	0
oh	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	1
didn't	0
i	1
didn't	0
even	0
like	0
the	1
previews	1
on	0
that	0

oh	0
i	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
well	1
i	0
ended	1
up	0
at	0
the	0
theater	1
and	1
there	0
was	0
didn't	0
seem	1
to	0
be	0
anything	1
else	0
on	1
i	0
wanted	1
to	1
see	0
so	0
i'll	1
try	0
that	1

but	0
it	0
wasn't	0
worth	1
anything	0
i	1
didn't	0
care	1
for	1
that	0
at	0
all	1

no	0

i	1
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
much	0
care	1
for	0
Michael	1
J	0
Fox	1
anyway	1

yeah	0
well	0
the	0
last	1
two	1
i	0
saw	1
him	0
in	0
one	1
of	0
those	1
Back	1
to	0
the	0
Future	1
Part	1
Three	1
deals	1
and	0
that	1
was	0
crummy	0
also	1
i	1
didn't	0
think	0
that	1
was	0
any	0
good	1
so	0

yeah	0

so	0

i	1
saw	1
the	0
original	1
Back	1
to	1
the	1
Future	1
and	1
then	0
i	0
i	0
know	0
i	0
hardly	1
ever	1
go	0
see	0
a	0
sequel	1

yeah	0

i	0
mean	1
i	0
think	1
i	1
think	1
the	0
only	0
i've	1
ever	0
seen	0
a	0
sequel	1
was	0
Two	0
Thousand	1
and	0
One	1

oh	0
boy	0

uh	0
Two	0
Thousand	1
and	0
Ten	0
was	0
far	0
better	1

yeah	0
yeah	0

Two	1
Thousand	0
and	0
One	1
was	0
a	0
good	0
movie	1
if	1
you	0
had	0
read	0
the	0
book	1

well	0
i	1
hadn't	0
read	1
it	0
and	0
i	1
couldn't	0
figure	0
what	0
was	0
going	0
on	1
half	1
the	0
time	0
so	0

yeah	0
no	0
nobody	1
could	0
figure	0
it	0
out	1
i	0
mean	0
the	0
the	0
book	0
was	0
so	0
much	0
uh	0

yeah	0

there's	0
just	0
things	0
all	1
you	0
can	0
do	0
is	0
put	0
it	0
in	0
words	1
you	0
can't	0
put	0
it	0
in	0
pictures	1

yeah	1
yeah	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	0
stuff	1
that	0
was	0
going	0
on	1
in	0
the	0
film	1
you	0
c[ould]	0
say	0
what	1
is	0
this	1

you	0
know	0
what's	0
the	0
significance	1
of	1
the	0
apes	0
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
i	0
should	0
probably	1
go	0
back	1
and	0
read	0
the	0
book	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
just	0
saw	0
the	0
movie	0
again	1
not	0
too	0
long	1
ago	0

oh	0
the	1
book	0
is	1
really	0
good	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	1
keep	0
a	0
little	0
library	1
of	0
books	1
that	0
i	0
just	0
like	0
to	0
read	1
over	0
and	0
over	1
again	1
and	1
that's	1
one	1
of	1
them	0
it's	1

wow	0
huh	0

it's	1
it's	1
so	0
well	0
written	1

huh	1
huh	0
well	1
i	1
have	1
one	1
i	0
bet	1
you	1
haven't	0
seen	0
if	0
you	0
don't	1
have	0
kids	1
Otis	1
and	0
Milo	1

oh	0
you're	1
right	0
i	1
haven't	0

oh	1
that	1
is	0
that	1
is	0
the	0
most	0
precious	1
movie	1
it	0
has	1
w[as]	0
to	0
see	1
it	0
on	0
the	0
big	1
screen	1
because	0
it's	0
just	1
the	0
most	0
gorgeous	1
nature	1
scenes	0
you've	0
ever	1
seen	0
in	0
your	0
life	1
and	0
it's	0
all	1
this	0
it's	0
the	0
story	1
of	0
this	0
little	0
cat	1
and	0
dog	1
and	0
it's	0
not	0
like	0
cutesy	0
it's	0
just	1
uh	0
it's	0
just	0
so	1
realistic	1
everything	1
they	0
do	0
you	0
wonder	0
how	1
in	0
the	0
world	1
they	0
ever	1
got	0
them	0
to	0
do	1
some	0
of	0
these	0
things	1

huh	0
oh	0
those	0
a	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
real	0
dog	0
and	0
cat	0
and	0

a	0
real	0
dog	0
and	0
cat	0

huh	0

and	0
all	0
the	0
other	0
animals	0
they	0
initially	1
start	0
out	1
in	0
the	0
barnyard	1
kind	0
of	0
setting	1
where	0
they're	0
raised	1
and	0
then	0
the	0
cat	1
gets	0
um	0
on	0
this	0
treacherous	1
journey	1
he	0
climbs	1
into	0
a	0
box	1
and	0
ends	0
up	0
floating	1
down	0
this	0
river	1
and	0
he	1
winds	1
up	0
all	1
over	0
creation	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
where	1
in	0
the	0
world	1
it	0
is	1
somewhere	1
in	0
China	1
somewhere	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
it	0
was	1
filmed	1

huh	0

but	1
uh	0
it's	0
just	1
really	1
an	1
incredible	1
thing	1

s[ounds]	0
sounds	1
sort	1
of	0
like	0
The	0
Incredible	0
Journey	1

yeah	0
it	0
was	0
pretty	0
wild	0
and	0
of	0
course	1
the	0
only	1
sound	1
is	0
Dudley	1
Moore	0
narrates	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

but	1
there's	0
no	1
you	0
know	0
nothing	1
else	1
to	0
keep	1
it	0
going	1
but	0
it	1
really	0
keeps	0
keeps	0
me	0
going	0
i	0

huh	0

i	0
i've	1
seen	1
it	0
twice	1
now	0

yeah	0

sounds	1
a	0
lot	0
like	0
a	0
Walt	1
Disney	1
film	0

huh	0

a	0
lot	1
a	0
like	0

best	1
of	0
the	0
Walt	1
Disney	0

Walt	1
Disney's	0
kind	0

opinion	1
in	0
the	0
past	1
few	0
years	0

The	0

Journey	1
on	0
Christmas	1
Eve	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
so	1
good	1
i	1
had	0
forgotten	1
that	0
it	0
was	1
Christmas	1
Eve	1

oh	0
boy	0

hm	0

i	0
mean	0
that's	1
that's	1
something	1
for	0
a	0
kid	1

that's	0
pretty	0
good	0

really	0

and	0
that	1
was	0
something	1
for	1
greedy	1
old	1
me	1
at	0
Christmas	1
time	1
i'll	1
tell	0
you	0

let's	0
see	0
what	1
are	0
some	0
other	1

a	0
riot	1
to	0
see	0
that	1

you	0

something	0
i	0
come	1

it	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
the	0
movies	1
one	0
time	1

yeah	0
because_1	0
when	1
you're	0
touristing	1
you	0
probably	1
don't	0
want	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
time	1
to	0
go	0
see	0
a	0
movie	1
but	0

i	0
uh	0
where	1
i	0
lived	1
uh	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
little	0
town	1
called	0
Newmarket	1
about	1
seventy	1
miles	0
north	0
of	0
London	1
and	0

huh	0

oh	0

another	1
town	1
called	0
Barry	1
Saint	0
Edmunds	1
about	1
twenty	0
miles	1
away	0
from	0
us	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	0
had	1
a	0
little	1
uh	0
theater	1
company	0
there	1
and	0
we	1
use	0
to	0
go	0
go	0
out	0
to	0
that	1
about	0
once	1
a	0
week	0

oh	0
boy	0

yeah	0
a	0
really	0
nice	0
place	0
you	0
know	0
amateurs	0
but	0
really	0
quite	0
good	0

yeah	0

uh	0
that	0
that	0
was	0
interesting	0
course	0
used	0
to	0
go	1
to	0
London	1
quite	0
a	0
lot	1
and	0
see	0
shows	1
down	0
there	1

that	0
sounds	0
great	0

yeah	0

uh	0
but	0
other	0
than	0
that	1
i	0
just	0
didn't	1
have	0
time	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
the	0
movies	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	0

never	0
show	1
any	0

anything	1
that	0
i	1
ever	0
wanted	0
i	0
rented	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
videos	1

uh-huh	0

because_1	0
the	0
closest	1
movie	1
theater	0
was	0
Barry	1
Saint	0
Edmunds	1
and	0
who	0
wants	1
who	0
wants	0
to	0
drive	1
twenty	1
miles	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
the	0
movies	1

oh	0
boy	0

probably	0
some	0
of	0
them	0
did	0

a	0
lot	0
of	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
did	0
but	0

yeah	0

but	0
it	0
would	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
good	1
show	1

it's	0
hard	1
to	0
know	1
what	1
the	0
good	1
movies	0
are	1
anymore	0
because	0

yeah	0

because	0
sometimes	1
the	0
reviews	1
you	0
just	0
can't	1
go	1
by	0
and	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	0
use	0
they	0
they	0
they	0
have	1
all	0
these	0
neat	1
phrases	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
like	0
critically	1
acclaimed	1

yeah	0

that's	1
what	0
they	0
say	1
when	0
the	0
thing	1
hasn't	0
won	1
any	0
award	1

oh	0
i	0
see	0

you	0
know	0
they	0
can't	0

it's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	0
waterfront	1
property	1
or	0
something	1
if	0
you're	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
you're	0
two	1
miles	0
away	1
from	0
water	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

yeah	0
from	0
Love	0
Canal	0

water	0
view	0

waterfront	0
property	0
here	0
at	0
Love	0
Canal	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	0

but	0
you	0
know	0
critically	0
acclaimed	0
oh	0
good	0
grief	0
give	0
me	0
a	0
break	0

that's	0
wh[at]	0
i	0
mean	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
reasons	1
why	1
i	0
don't	0
go	0
to	0
movies	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
primarily	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
now	0
i'm	0
probably	1
going	0
to	0
going	0
to	0
upset	1
you	0
but	0
people	1
who	0
bring	1
kids	1
irritates	1
the	0
heck	1
out	0
of	0
me	0

okay	1

the	1
topic	1
is	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
uh	1
sources	1
where	1
i	1
receive	1
news	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	1
for	1
me	1
that's	1
uh	1
mostly	1
newspaper	1
and	1
radio	1
i	0
almost	1
never	1
watch	1
television	1
as	1
a	0
matter	1
of	0
course	1
so	1
i	1
don't	1
get	1
news	0
from	1
television	1
except	0
during	1
the	1
war	0
i	1
watched	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
CNN	1
because	0
it	1
was	0
so	0
good	1

uh-huh	0

well	0
why	1
was	0
CNN	1
the	0
on[ly]	0
of	0
course	0
i	0
think	1
Saddam	1
Hussein	1
only	1
allowed	1
CNN	0
to	1
broadcast	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
not	1
true	1

um	0

it	1
was	1
unusual	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
different	1
sources	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
news	0
coverage	1

yeah	1
um	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	0
guess	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
even	0
know	0
why	1
i	1
watch	0
CNN	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	1
wanted	1
more	0
news	1
it's	0
one	1
of	1
the	0
few	1
times	1
i	1
wanted	0
more	0
news	1
than	0

yeah	1
well	0
i	1
know	0
even	1
if	1
you	0
watched	1
ABC	1
NBC	0
or	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
y[ou]	0
i	1
mean	0
what's	1
the	1
other	0
one	0
uh	0
CBS	1

CBS	1

they	0
all	1
were	0
were	0
tapped	1
into	0
CNN	1

were	1
they	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

that's	1
the	0
only	0
thing	0
they	0
broadcast	1
an[d]	0
like	1
you	0
i	1
listen	0
to	0
the	0
radio	0
on	0
my	0
job	1
at	0
work	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
all	1
this	0
week	0
they've	1
been	0
having	0
this	0
uh	1
a	1
discussion	1
about	0
that	1
is	1
why	1
uh	1
why	1
CNN	1
was	0
well	1
i	1
listen	0
to	0
a	0
Christian	1
radio	1
station	0

um-hum	0

and	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
CNN	1
is	0
definitely	1
a	1
world	1
uh	1
news	1
service	1
and	1
uh	1
that	1
was	1
you	1
can't	1
really	0
be	1
sure	1
of	1
the	0
quality	1
of	1
what	0
you	0
got	1
you	1
know	1

hm	0

uh	0
we	0
had	1
some	0
uh	0
some	0
people	1
from	0
our	0
church	1
went	0
to	0
Israel	1
uh	0
just	0
for	1
a	0
uh	0
tour	1
sort	1
of	0
thing	0

um-hum	1

and	1
i	1
was	0
watching	1
on	0
TV	1
they	1
they	0
broadcast	0
this	0
terrible	1
riot	1
supposedly	0
that	0
was	1
going	1
on	0
in	0
Jerusalem	1
so	0
we	0
got	1
all	1
fearful	1
for	0
our	1
people	0
come	0
to	0
find	0
out	1
they	0
came	0
back	1
and	0
said	0
they	0
weren't	0
even	1
aware	1
of	0
it	1

right	1

and	0
so	1
it	1
really	1
made	1
me	0
question	1
as	0
to	0
what	1
how	1
do	0
we	0
know	1
ab[out]	0
you	0
know	1
uh	0
if	0
the	0
news	0
we're	1
getting	1
is	0
any	1
good	1
so	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	0
the	0
news	0
just	0
focuses	0
on	0
major	0
events	1
that	0
probably	0
don't	0
affect	0
ninety	0
nine	0
percent	0
of	1
the	0
people	1
who	0
are	0
right	0
there	1
when	0
the	0
news	1
is	0
being	0
made	1

yeah	1

right	1
right	1

but	0
uh	0
i	1
c[an]	0
i'm	1
from	0
California	1
and	0
i	1
can	0
remember	0
being	0
in	0
uh	0
in	0
these	0
earthquakes	1
and	0
i	0
mean	0
they	1
were	0
they	0
were	0
very	0
minor	1
kinds	0
of	0
things	1
from	0
my	1
point	0
of	0
view	0
and	0
it	0
seemed	1
you	0
know	0
from	0
anyone	0
else's	1
point	0
of	0
view	0
but	0

yeah	0

but	0
they'd	0
get	0
all	1
blown	0
up	0
in	0
the	0
news	0
uh	0

uh-huh	0
well	0
i	1
it	0
i	1
find	0
it	0
depressing	1
to	0
watch	1
or	0
especially	1
TV	0
you	0
know	1
it's	1
uh	1
local	1
news	1
concentrates	1
on	1
murders	1
and	0
things	0
like	1
that	1
i'm	1
from	0
Dallas	1
and	0
uh	0
we	1
have	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
bad	1
stuff	1
it	1
just	0
really	1
gets	1
me	1
depressed	1
even	1
to	0
watch	1
it	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0
yeah	1

so	0
then	1
you	0
wake	1
up	0
one	0
morning	0
and	0
you're	0
in	0
war	1
with	0
somebody	0
you	0
don't	0
even	0
know	1
about	0
it	0

right	1

so	1

oh	0
what	1
newspaper	1
uh	0
do	1
you	1
read	1
in	0
Dallas	1

uh	0
we	1
have	1
the	1
Dallas	1
Times	0
Herald	1
and	0
the	1
Dallas	1
Morning	0
News	0
but	0
i	1
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
read	1
[laughter-newspapers]	1

don't	1
you	1

huh-uh	0

how	0
come	1

i	0
have	0
find	1
it	0
hard	1
to	0
uh	0
follow	1
from	0
one	0
page	1
to	0
another	1
it's	0
just	0
something	1
i've	0
never	0
developed	1
uh	0
an	0
interest	1
in	0

huh	0

and	0
i	1
live	0
in	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
bad	1
area	0
where	0
if	0
i	0
have	1
the	0
paper	0
delivered	1
it's	0
stolen	1
before	1
i	0
[laughter-can]	0
[laughter-get]	0
[laughter-out]	1
and	0
get	1
it	0

Go[d]	1
that's	1
uh	0
that	0
sounds	1
pretty	0
bad	1
to	0
me	0
i	0
mean	0
who	0
would	0
steal	1
a	0
newspaper	1

you'd	0
be	0
surprised	1

hm	0

they	0
just	0
come	0
by	1
and	0
pick	1
them_1	0
up	0
even	0
if	0
it's	0
just	0
for	1
the	0
TV	1
you	0
know	1
uh	0
selections	1
of	0
the	0
day	1
i	1

i	1
see	0

i	1
don't	0
know	0
it	0
just	0
wouldn't	0
be	1
there	0
whenever	0
i've	0
tried	1
it	0

yeah	1

so	0
you're	0
right	1
who	0
would	0
steal	1
a	0
newspaper	1
but	1
they	0
do	1

yeah	1

what	0
part	1
of	0
California	1

this	0

that	0
has	1
this	0
purple	1
ball	1
on	0
the	0
top	1
of	0
it	0
but	0
that	0
purple	0
ball	0

okay	1
this	1
topic	1
is	1
is	1
Russia	1
a	1
threat	1
to	1
our	1
security	1
i	1
think	1
they're	1
more	1
of	1
a	0
threat	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
people	1
at	1
this	1
day	0
and	0
time	1
how	0
do	0
you	1
feel	0
about	1
it	1

well	1
they	1
do	1
have	1
uh	1
a	1
major	1
internal	1
problem	1
everybody	1
wants	1
to	1
defect	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
understand	1
why	1
um	0
i	1
think	1
their	1
biggest	1
problem	1
is	1
just	1
you	1
know	1
obtaining	1
food	1
to	0
live	1
so	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
basic	1
needs	1
uh	1
being	1
unmet	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
think	1
globally	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
being	0
a	1
threat	1
to	0
other	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
world	1

so	0
as	1
soon	1
as	0
they	0
get	1
their	1
their	1
own	1
home	1
country	1
taken	1
care	1
of	1
then	1
they'll	0
consider	1
what	1
they	1
can	0
do	1
with	1
the	0
rest	1
of	1
the	0
world	1

i	0
believe	1
Communism	1
is	0
very	1
much	0
waning	1
it's	1
uh	0
pretty	1
much	0
on	0
the	1
way	1
out	1
of	0
the	1
door	1
in	1
so	0
far	1
as	1
the	1
strong	1
hold	1
that	0
they	0
used	1
to	0
have	1
and	1
the	0
Russian	1
people	1
are	0
all	1
realizing	1
that	1
the	1
Communist	1
system	1
does	1
not	1
work	1
to	0
their	1
satisfaction	1
or	0
their	0
way	1
of	1
surviving	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
their	1
rebellions	1
right	0
now	1
is	0
the	0
result	1
of	0
that	1
i[f]	0
if	0
they	1
can	0
get	1
the	0
army	1
or	1
the	0
military	1
to	0
sway	1
to	0
their	0
side	1
i	1
think	1
that	0
uh	0
it	1
will	1
be	1
on	0
the	1
way	0
out	1
eventually	1

it's	0
just	1
a	0
matter	0
of	1
time	1
because	1
in	0
the	0
Baltic	1
States	1
they've	0
already	1
massacred	1
so	0
many	0
people	1
who	0
protested	1
and	1

and	1
that	0
hasn't	1
set	0
too	1
well	1
with	0
their	1
diplomacy	1
for	0
the	1
regarding	1
the	0
uh	0
outcome	1
of	0
their	1
affairs	1
what's	0
your	0
synopsis	1

well	1
i	0
do	1
i	1
do	1
realize	0
that	1
um	1
uh	1
the	0
Bush	1
Administration	1
isn't	0
too	0
happy	1
with	1
with	0
how	1
they're	1
handling	1
their	0
internal	1
um	0
strife	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
diplomacy	1
is	0
concerned	1
i	1
think	0
it's	0
been	0
a	1
good	1
a	0
good	1
uh	1
positive	1
direction	1
for	1
um	1
the	1
Soviets	1
as	0
far	0
as	1
Yeltsin	1
is	0
concerned	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
was	0
um	0
allowed	1
to	1
what	0
wh[at]	0
in	0
his	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
Congress	1
they	0
they	0
gave	1
him	0
more	0
power	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
his	0
republic	1
in	0
Russia	1
is	0
concerned	1
which	0
is	1
gives	1
him	0
more	0
power	1
overall	1
which	0
i	1
think	0
is	1
a	0
good	0
sign	1
that	0
there'll	1
be	0
some	1
you	0
know	1
politically	1
speaking	1
you	1
know	0
he's	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
more	0
power	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
a	0
step	1
in	0
the	0
right	0
direction	1
i	0
think	0
Gorbachev	1
realizes	1
that	0
he's	1
got	1
a	1
a	0
major	1
uh	0
uh	0
power	1
figure	1
you	0
know	1
competing	1
against	0
him	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
gonna	0
be	1
pretty	1
close	0
to	0
his	0
demise	1
if	0
he	0
doesn't	1
follow	0
suit	1
with	0
Yeltsin	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
uh	0
realizing	1
well	1
he	0
does	1
realize	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
with	0
the	0
fact	1
that	1
they	0
reduced	1
the	0
uh	0
or	0
they	0
increased	1
the	0
prices	1
on	0
their	0
food	1
food	1
and	0
goods	1

uh-huh	1
i	1

uh	0
it	1
yeah	1

i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
went	1
up	1
a	0
thousand	1
percent	1
on	0
most	1

yeah	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	1
incredible	1
but	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
um	0
go	1
in	0
the	0
direction	1
of	0
a	0
market	1
driven	0
economy	1
and	1
and	0
they	0
had	0
to	0
bite	1
the	0
bullet	1
for	0
that	1
so	0
that's	1
a	0
good	0
move	1
on	1
on	0
Gorbachev's	1
part	1
in	0
doing	0
that	1

um-hum	0

so	1

but	0
Gorbachev	1
has	0
still	1
not	0
fully	1
convinced	1
everyone	1
that	1
he's	1
moving	0
towards	1
a	0
two	1
to	1
three	0
party	1
system	1
of	0
government	1
that	0
nor	1
eliminating	1
or	1
diminishing	1
the	0
Communist	0
power	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
where	0
Yeltsin	1
steps	0
in	1
so	0
far	1
as	0
his	0
politics	1
of	0
government	1
goes	1
uh	0
but	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	0
convinced	1
the	1
people	1
are	0
of	1
him	1
yet	1
myself	1

well	1
that's	1
all	0
they	0
got	1
right	0
now	1
that's	0
their	0
ray	1
of	0
hope	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
you	0
know	1
they'll	1
go	0
with	1
you	0
know	1
w[ho]	1
whoever	1
comes	0
through	1
for	0
them	1
i	1

i	1
it	1
it's	1
just	0
that	1
w[hat]	0
the	0
weird	1
thing	0
is	1
is	0
that	0
Gorbachev	1
is	0
the	0
one	1
that	0
opened	1
the	0
floodgates	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
with	0
glasnost	1
and	0
[poistroi[ka]-/perestroika]	1
perestroika	1
and	0
stuff	1
and	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
he's	0
caught	1
between	1
the	0
Old	0
Guard	1
and	1
and	1
the	0
new	1
uh	0
glasnost	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
kind	0
of	1
uh	0
escalate	1
to	0
a	0
point	1
where	0
it's	0
out	1
of	0
control	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
had	1
to	0
pull	1
in	0
the	0
reins	1
the	0
only	1
way	0
he	1
knew	0
how	1
in	0
order	1
to	0
keep	1
the	0
peace	1
on	0
peace	1
on	0
both	0
sides	1
so	0
i	0
think	1
that's	0
where	1
you	0
know	1
kind	1
of	0
where	0
he's	0
stuck	1
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1

yeah	1
uh	0
i	1
understand	1
it	0

and	1
that's	0
the	1
that's	0
the	1
situation	1
that	0
he	0
finds	1
himself	0
in	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
he's	1
a	0
tough	0
guy	1
i	0
mean	0
he's	1
been	0
through	1
it	0
so	0
i	0
have	1
no	0
doubt	1
that	0
he'll	1
i	0
mean	1
y[ou]	0
i	1
i	1
think	0
overall	1
he's	1
been	0
a	1
a	0
good	1
ah	0
figure	1
for	1
the	0
the	0
Soviet	1
Union	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
think	1
his	0
intentions	1
and	0
his	0
ideals	1
are	1
are	1
uh	0
well	1
intentioned	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
in	0
the	0
long-term	1
but	0
i	0
just	1
think	0
that	1
because	0
of	1
the	0
basic	0
needs	1
that	0
the	0
people	1
don't	0
have	1
i	0
think	0
that	1
that	0
makes	1
the	0
problem	1
most	0
severe	1
and	0
makes	1
him	0
look	1
look	0
worse	1
that	0
what	0
his	1
um	0
what	0
his	1
ideals	0
are	1
personally	1

i	0
agree	1
what's	1
bad	1
for	0
the	1
Soviet	1
system	1
is	1
that	1
they	0
have	1
the	1
resources	1
to	0
grow	1
and	0
produce	1
their	1
food	1
but	0
somehow	1
it	0
just	1
does	0
not	1
get	0
out	1
to	0
the	1
market	1
the	0
way	1
it	1
should	1

i	0
think	0
it's	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
oh	0
how	1
do	0
you	0
put	0
it	1
bureaucracy	1
and	0
and	0
and	1
uh	0
one	0
thing	1
and	0
then	0
all	1
the	0
corruption	1
i	0
think	0
there's	0
a	1
a	1
a	0
large	1
amount	0
of	0
corruption	1
on	0
the	0
the	0
have	1
and	0
the	0
have	1
nots	1
you	0
know	0
i	1

yeah	1
that's	0
probably	1
more	1
true	1
than	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	0
realize	1

i	1
i	0
know	0
you're	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
that	0
with	0
every	0
society	1
at	0

at	0
least	0
we're	1
more	0
blatant	1
about	0
it	1
but	0
it's	1
very	0
secret	1
and	0
it's	0
been	0
going	0
on	1
for	0
years	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
can't	1
change	1
things	0
overnight	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
but	0
if	0
it	0
gets	1
to	0
a	0
point	1
where	0
people	0
can't	1
survive	1
i	0
mean	1
there's	0
revolution	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
that's	1

it	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
headed	1
in	0
that	0
direction	1
too	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
big	0
time	1
major	1
but	1
you	0
know	0
that's	1
that's	0
what	0
happens	1
when	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
cork	1
blows	1
and	0
you	0
can't	0
handle	1
it	0
anymore	1
i	0
mean	1
that's	1
that's	0
the	0
way	1
the	0
world	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
revolves	1
that	0
way	1

uh-huh	0
well	0
their	0
knowledge	1
with	1
uh	0
better	0
communication	1
processes	1
in	0
this	0
world	1
now	0
that's	0
reached	1
them	0
is	1
more	1
educated	1
than	0
to	0
the	1
uh	0
ways	1
of	0
the	0
western	1
world	1

i	0
really	1
question	1
though	0
how	0
much	0
technology	1
the	0
average	1
Soviet	1
is	0
exposed	1
to	1

and	0
um	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
was	0
a	0
big	1
stepping	0
stone	1
for	0
them	0
to	1
initiate	1
all	0
their	1
righteous	1
ways	1
of	1
changing	1
things	1
to	1

they	1
probably	1
not	0
enough	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	1
i	0
lot	0
of	0
it's	0
filtered	1
down	0
enough	1
to	0
the	0
common	1
folks	1
that	0
they	1
have	0
gotten	0
wind	1
of	0
what	1
they're	0
missing	1
out	1
on	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
they're	0
starting	1
to	0
realize	1
but	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
don't	0
think	1
they	0
have	1
the	1
resources	1
if	0
you	0
were	1
to	0
compare	1
uh	0
the	0
Americans	1
to	0
the	0
Soviets	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
home	1
computers	1
are	0
concerned	1
or	0
fact	1
machines	0
fax	1
machines	1
and	0
cellular	1
phones	1
and	0
state	1
of	0
the	0
art	0
equipment	1
that	0
we	1
are	0
so	0
used	1
to	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
they	0
even	1
realize	1
what's	0
out	0
there	1
and	0
to	1
what	0
extent	1

yeah	1
i'm	0
sure	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
them	0
are	0
missing	1
those	1
household	0
items	1

yeah	1
all	1
the	0
major	1
conveniences	1
of	0
life	1

yeah	0
what	0
we	0
consider	1
just	1
i	0
don't	1
[laughter-know]	0
normal	1
everyday	0
things	1
to	0
them	1
is	0
real	1
luxury	0
which	1
is	0
unfortunate	1
for	0
them	1

yeah	0

and	1
of	0
course	0
most	1
of	0
us	1
we	0
don't	0
really	0
appreciate	1
what	0
we've	0
got	1
because	0
we've	0
been	1
so	0
used	1
to	0
it	0

this	1
is	0
true	1
this	0
is	0
very	1
true	1
and	0
we	1
it's	0
human	1
it's	0
human	1
nature	0
though	1
to	1
take	1
things	0
for	0
granted	1
and	0
it	0
kind	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
when	0

when	0
you've	1
lost	1
something	1
or	1
or	0
uh	0
uh	0
don't	0
have	1
what	0
other	0
people	0
have	1
that's	0
when	0
you	0
tend	1
to	0
realize	1
you	0
know	1
what's	1
out	0
there	1
and	0
what	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
you	0
have	1
and	0
what	0
you	0
don't	0
have	1

yeah	0
i	0
agree	1

so	0
the	0
original	1
question	1
do	0
we	0
think	1
they're	0
a	0
threat	1
to	0
our	0
you	0
know	1
a	0
s[ecurity]	1
s[ecurity]	0
security	1
threat	1

yeah	1

um	0
yes	1
and	0
no	1

yeah	1
i	1
can	0
go	1
with	1
that	0
answer	1
too	1
the	0
only	0
yes	1
i	0
could	0
go	1
to	0
is	0
if	1
uh	0
a	0
renegade	1
crew	1
decides	1
to	0
launch	1
an	0
attack	1
or	0
an	0
accidental	1
launching	1
of	0
something	1
to	0
that	0
effect	1
to	1
for	0
to	0
a	0
nuclear	1
exchange	1
but	0
i	0
don't	1
even	0
see	0
that	1
occurring	1
uh	0
because	0
their	1
internal	1
strifes	1
are	0
more	0
important	1
right	0
now	1
than	1
concentrating	1
on	0
any	0
kind	0
of	0
outside	1
affairs	1
that	0
they	0
used	1
to	0
be	1
adapted	1
to	0
i	0
guess	1

um	0
no	1

well	0
i	0
don't	1
really	0
feel	1
that	0
the	0
Soviets	1
really	0
want	1
to	0
blow	0
up	0
the	0
world	1
i	0
mean	1
um	0
we	1
painted	1
them	0
back	1
in	0
the	0
fifties	1
and	0
sixties	1
as	1
as	1
nonfeeling	1
machine	1
type	0
people	1
and	0
they're	1
people	1
just	0
like	0
us	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	1
up	0
everyday	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	0
put	1
their	0
pants	1
on	0
the	0
same	1
way	1
and	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
eat	1
and	0
everything	0
else	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
don't	0
feel	1
that	1

okay	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
um	1
this	1
is	1
probably	1
really	1
a	1
good	1
subject	1
for	1
me	1
because	1
i	1
really	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
uh	1
hand	1
work	1
uh	0
mostly	1
i	0
do	1
needlepoint	1
i	1
guess	1

oh	1
really	1

but	0
um	1

what	0
kinds	1
of	0
things	1
have	1
you	0
done	1

um	0
well	1
i've	1
made	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
baby	1
gifts	1

aha	0

it	0
seem	1
like	0
that's	0
like	1
especially	1
lately	1
there's	0
been	1
so	1
many	1
babies	1
that	1
uh	1
bibs	1
and	1
blankets	1
and	0
things	0
like	1
that	0
wall	1
hangings	0
um	0

do	1
you	1
ever	0
keep	1
any	0
of	0
your	1
stuff	1

isn't	0
that	0
funny	0
no	0

i	1
do	0
crochet	1
and	0
a	1
lot	0
of	1
uh	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
and	0
i	1
have	1
very	0
little	1
of	0
my	0
own	1
stuff	1
and	1
and	0
it	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	1
embarrassing	0
people	0
say	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
some	0
of	1
your	0
work	1

oh	1
well	1
can	0
you	1
go	1
to	1
so	1
and	0

yeah	0
isn't	1
that	0
funny	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
do	1
have	1
one	0
thing	1
um	0
a	0
friend	1
of	0
mine	0
gave	0
me	1
a	0
clock	1
kit	1
and	1

ooh	0

and	1
i	1
i	1
needlepointed	1
the	0
the	0
face	1
and	1
i	1
uh	1
kept	0
that	1
because	1
she	1
gave	1
me	1
that	1
so	0

that	1
that	0
would	0
be	1
definitely	1
something	0
you'd	0
want	0
to	0
keep	1

oh	1
yeah	1
and	0
it's	0
real	0
neat	1

was	1
was	0
the	0
whole	0
face	0
done	1
or	0
just	0
the	0
numbers	0
uh	0
and	1
and	1
like	0
minute	0
marks	1

um	0
basically	0
the	0
the	0
whole	0
well	0
no	0
i	0
guess	0
the	0
minute	0
marks	0
but	0
the	0
minute	1
marks	0
are	0
done	1
they're	0
like	1
hearts	0

oh	0

and	0
then	1
the	0
at	1
the	1
numbers	1
they	1
they're	1
kind	0
of	0
outlined	1
and	0
stuff	1
it	1
it	1
was	0
quite	1
bit	0
of	1
work	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
it	1
was	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
too	1
i	1
really	1
like	0
doing	1
stuff	1
like	1
that	1
so	1

i	1
did	0
some	0
needlepoint	1
years	1
ago	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
got	0
into	0
the	0
Bargello	1

oh	0
what's	0
that	0

well	0
it's	0
an	0
Italian	1
um	0
needlework	1
using	1
using	1
the	0
uh	0
i	0
started	0
to	0
say	0
the	0
canvas	1
but	0
the	0
uh	0
hum	0
the	0
what	0
what	0
kind	1
of	0
cloth	1
uses	1
that	0
i	1
i've	1
just	0
gone	0
blank	1
but	1
it's	0
used	1
wi[th]	0
uh	1
with	0
yarn	1
and	1
it	0
usually	1
takes	1
long	1
stitches	1
over	0
two	1
or	0
three	0
openings	1
in	0
the	0
cloth	1

huh	0

and	1
you	0
weave	1
intricate	0
patterns	1
and	0
use	0
different	0
colors	1
like	1
it	0
could	0
be	0
a	0
flame	1
stitch	0
where	0
so	0
rather	1
than	1
drawing	1
a	0
picture	1
you're	1
making	0
a	1
design	1
like	0
a	0
geometric	1
or	1
whatever	1
and	1
it	1
was	0
used	1
quite	1
often	1
in	1
the	0
colonial	1
times	1
to	0
uh	0
uh	1
to	0
upholster	1
chairs	1
and	1
so	0
forth	1
as	0
well	1
as	0
the	0
crewel	1
um	0
embroidery	1
work	0
that	0
was	0
done	1
on	0
them	0

wow	0
well	0
that's	0
interesting	0
what	0
did	1
you	1
what	0
kind	1
of	1
things	1
did	1
you	1
do	0

what	1
i	1
did	1
when	1
when	1
i	0
was	1
doing	1
that	1
was	1
mostly	0
pillows	0
you	1
know	0
for	0
sofas	0
and	1
so	0
forth	1
and	1
i	0
can't	1
find	0
one	1
that	0
i've	0
done	1

oh	0

it's	1
one	0
of	1
those	0
things	1
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	1
give	0
them	1
away	1
but	0
i	1
didn't	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
been	1
my	0
color	1
choice	1
or	0
multiple	1
moves	1
or	1
or	0
what	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
i	1
was	1
so	0
proud	1
of	0
them	0
when	0
i	0
got	1
them	0
finished	1
but	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	0
where	0
they	0
are	1

what	0
did	0
you	0
call	0
that	0

bargello	0
it's	0
B	1
A	0
R	1
G	1
E	1
double	0
L	1
O	1

huh	0
that's	0
i've	0
never	1
heard	1
of	0
that	0
before	1
i've	0
probably	1
seen	1
it	0
though	0
i	0

i	0
suspect	0
you	0
i	0
suspect	0
you	0
have	0

i	0
mean	0
when	0
you	0
described	0
it	0

yeah	0
i	0
mean	1
when	0
you	0
described	1
it	0
it	0
sounded	1
like	0
something	1
you	0
know	0
that	0
would	0
be	1
around	1
i	0
guess	0
but	1
um	0
i've	0
never	1
heard	1
of	0
it	0
before	0
and	0
it's	0
really	0
interesting	0
um	0
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
decorated	1
baskets	1
and	0
stuff	0
before	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
but	0
i've	0
kind	1
of	0
gotten	0
out	0
of	0
that	1
i	0
use	1
to	0
do	0
a	0
lot	1
more	1
and	0
sell	1
at	0
craft	1
shows	0

me	0
too	0

really	0

yeah	0
that's	1
interesting	0

yeah	0
it	0
[laughter-is]	0

how	1
did	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
choose	0
this	1
subject	0
tonight	1
that's	0
funny	0
uh	0
uh	0
what	1
how	0
did	0
you	0
what	0
kinds	1
of	0
decorations	1
did	0
you	0
use	1
with	0
the	0
bas[kets]	1
how	0
were	0
you	0
decorating	1
the	0
baskets	1

oh	0
basically	0
bows	0
and	0
lace	0
uh	0
ribbons	0
um	0

um	0

um	0
i	0
really	0
wanted	0
to	0
do	0
you	0
know	0
so	0
many	1
of	1
them	0
now	1
have	1
the	1
ribbons	1
where	0
i'm	0
not	1
sure	0
how	1
they	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
the	0
ribbons	0
they	1
make	0
them	1
they	0
like	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
how	1
to	0
explain	0
it	0
they	0
make	0
them	0
hard	0
you	0
know	0

like	0
fabric	0
that's	0
been	0
stiffened	1
in	0

yeah	0

yes	1

i've	1
never	0
done	1
that	1
and	0
those	1
are	1
so	1
neat	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
would	0
really	1
like	1
to	0
do	0
those	1
but	1
um	0

i've	0
seen	0
some	0
and	0
there	0
there	0
they	0
i	0
suspect	1
they're	0
fairly	0
simple	1
because	0
the	0
one	1
lady	0
i've	0
seen	1
i	0
know	1
that	0
does	1
it	0
i've	0
never	0
asked	1
her	0
any	0
questions	1
but	0
she	1
has	0
three	1
kids	0
all	1
under	0
the	0
age	1
of	0
like	0
six	1

and	1
and	0
they're	1
all	1
a	0
handful	1
so	0
it's	0
got	1
to	0
be	0
something	0
she	1
can	0
do	0
fairly	1
easily	0
and	0
fairly	1
quickly	0

oh	0
definitely	0
yeah	0

when	1
i	0
do	1
um	0
crochet	1
it's	0
it's	0
usually	1
the	0
the	0
lacy	1
Victorian	1
type	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
and	1

oh	0

and	1
i	1
stiffen	1
those	1
with	0
a	0
a	0
glue	1
mixture	1
it's	0
like	1
white	1
glue	1
and	0
it	0
may	1
be	0
something	0
similar	0
to	0
that	1
that	0
the	0
fabric	1
is	0
dipped	1
in	0
and	0
then	1
um	0
allowed	0
to	0
dry	1
in	0
those	1
those	0
draping	1
bows	1
i	0
mean	0
those	0
draping	1
streamers	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0

oh	0

i	0
was	0
just	0
there's	0
bound	1
to	0
be	0
some	0
kind	0
of	0
fabric	1
stiffener	0
like	0
that	0
that's	0
very	0
similar	1
that's	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
melt	1
too	1
much	0
with	0
uh	0
uh	0
high	1
humidity	1
in	1
in	1
a	0
room	1

yeah	0

that's	1
i	0
think	1
that's	0
what	0
my	1
concern	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
wasn't	1
really	0
sure	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
how	1
they	1
would	0
last	1

do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
my	0
concern	1
is	1
how	0
will	0
i	0
dust	0
this	0
thing	1

you're	0
[laughter-right]	0
no	0

i'm	0
[laughter-terrible]	0

no	0
that's	0
true	0
[laughter-though]	0
that's	0
funny	0

so	0
many	0
of	0
my	0
crafts	0
well	0
right	0
now	1
i'm	0
looking	0
at	0
a	0
little	0
uh	0
uh	0
quilted	1
uh	0
uh	0
hanging	1
it's	1
like	0
it's	0
a	0
flag	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	0
wash	0
it	0
because	0
that	0
would	0
start	1
breaking	0
down	0
the	0
batting	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0
but	0
it's	0
such	0
a	0
dust	1
collector	0
to	0
be	0
out	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
most	1
of	0
my	0
things	0
are	1
dust	0
collectors	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
hate	0
to	0
dust	0

i	0
know	0

so	1
that's	0
the	0
first	0
thing	1
i	0
think	0
of	0
is	0
how	1
easy	0
would	0
this	0
thing	0
be	0
to	0
clean	1

that's	0
funny	0
no	0
i	0
just	0

i	0
have	0
really	1
have	0
gotten	1
out	1
of	0
it	0
i	0
don't	1
do	1
it	0
quite	0
as	0
much	1
as	0
i	0
used	1
to	0
um	1
i	0
guess	1
because	1
i	0
i	0
went	1
back	0
to	0
school	1
so	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
as	0
much	0
time	1

oh	0

time	1

now	0
and	0
i	0
have	1
two	0
children	1
[laughter-also]	0
[laughter-so]	0

you	0
definitely	1
don't	0
have	0
[laughter-time]	0

it	0
keeps	0
me	0
very	0
busy	0
but	0
i	1
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
do	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
get	0
the	0
chance	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	0
it's	0
so	1
relaxing	1
to	0
just	0
sit	1
and	0
but	0
once	1
i	0
get	0
started	1
i	0
can't	1
put	0
it	0
down	1
i	0
just	0

i	0
have	0
a	0
similar	1
problem	0
i've	0
got	1
to	0
have	0
time	1
or	0
i	0
don't	0
even	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
into	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
end	1
up	0
lots	0
of	0
time	1
not	0
doing	0
anything	0
at	0
all	1

i	0
know	0
i	0
started	1
a	0
project	1
it's	0
been	1
over	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
that	0
i	0
swore	1
i	0
was	0
going	1
to	0
finish	1
for	0
somebody	1
for	0
[laughter-Christmas]	1
and	0

you	0
just	1
didn't	1
say	1
which	0
Christmas	1
right	1

that's	1
what	0
i	0
keep	0
telling	1
this	0
[laughter-person]	1
well	0
i	0
didn't	1
tell	1
you	0
what	0
year	1

what	0
was	0
this	0
project	0

um	0
well	1
it's	0
a	0
it's	0
uh	0
cross	1
stitch	0
and	0
it's	0
a	0
picture	1
and	0
it's	0
a	0
wildlife	1
it	0
has	0
deer	1
and	0
trees	1
and	0
it's	0
really	0
beautiful	0
but	0
it's	0
going	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
work	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
i've	1
i	0
have	1
worked	0
on	0
it	0
quite	0
a	0
bit	1
but	1
not	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
so	0
hard	1

now	0
this	0
is	1
this	0
is	0
done	0
in	0
the	0
needlepoint	1

uh-huh	0
uh	1
well	0
i	0
shouldn't	1
it's	0
counted	1
cross	0
stitch	1
actually	1
is	0
what	0
i'm	0
doing	0
and	0
so	0
it's	0
really	1
since	0
it's	0
counted	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
work	1

yes	0
yes	0
i	0
do	0
know	0
i	0

yep	0

i	0
have	0
done	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
of	0
that	1
but	0
i've	0
decided	1
that	0
that's	0
something	0
that	0
demands	1
my	0
time	1
my	1
my	0
to[tal]	1
my	0
total	1
attention	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
i've	0
got	0
to	0
have	1
total	1
almost	0
total	1
silence	0
i	0
can't	1
really	0
watch	1
television	0
if	0
the	0
pattern	1
is	0
very	0
intricate	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you'd	0
have	1
lots	0
of	0
shading	1
on	0
that	0
particular	1
piece	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

yep	1

it	0
is	0
not	1
does	0
not	0
sound	0
like	0
an	0
easy	1
one	0
to	0
finish	1

no	0
it	0
really	0
isn't	0
and	0
i	0
tell	0
you	0
really	1
i	0
could	0
just	0
kick	1
myself	0
for	0
even	1
starting	1
[laughter-it]	0
because	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
feeling	1
i'm	0
never	1
going	0
to	0
get	0
it	0
done	1
i'm	0
probably	1
going	1
to	0
hear	1
about	0
it	0
the	0
rest	1
of	1
[laughter-my]	0
[laughter-life]	1

oh	0
i'm	0
sure	0
you'll	0
get	0
it	0
done	0
but	0
it	0
just	0
maybe	0
not	0
on	0
the	0
original	0
obviously	0
not	0
on	0
the	0
original	0
time	0
schedule	0

no	0
that's	0
true	0
i	1
i	0
just	1
don't	0
know	0
when	1
i'm	0
ever	0
it	0
just	1
seems	1
like	0
there's	0
just	0
never	1
enough	0
time	1
to	0
to	0
pick	1
it	0
up	0
and	0
do	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
really	0
hard	1
but	0
i	0
really	0
do	0
en[joy]	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
i	0
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
it's	0
just	0
hard	0

just	0
hard	0
finding	1
the	0
time	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
dedicated	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	1
many	0
other	0
things	1
that	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
done	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
meantime	1
like	0
i	0
said	0
so	0
many	0
baby	1
gifts	0
i've	0
made	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
bibs	1
and	0
wall	1
hangings	0
and	0
so	1
you	1
know	0
those	1
don't	0
take	1
much	0
time	0
at	0
all	1
so	0
it's	0
no	0
big	0
deal	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
pick	1
those	0
up	1
and	0
do	1
them	1

do	0
you	1
do	0
you	1
use	0
patterns	1
i	0
mean	0
like	0
a	0
book	1
of	0
patterns	1
or	0
do	0
you	0
go	0
out	0
an	0
buy	1
a	0
a	0
kit	1
like	1
for	0
a	0
bib	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

no	0
no	0
i	0
usually	1
just	0
buy	0
a	0
pattern	1
book	1
i	0
have	1
several	1
pattern	1
books	0
and	0
i	0
just	1
go	0
with	0
those	1

okay	0

and	0
then	1
i	0
buy	1
the	0
bibs	1
separate	1
usually	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
cheaper	1
in	0
the	0
long	1
run	1
and	0
then	0
i	1
just	0
use	0
whatever	1
colors	1
i	0
want	0
to	0
i	0
don't	0
usually	0
use	1
the	0
colors	0
they	0
tell	1
me	0
to	0

um	0

and	1
it	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
what	1
it	0
is	1
you	0
know	0
but	1
some	1
things	0
especially	1
letters	1
if	1
they	0
suggest	1
certain	1
colors	1
for	0
letters	1
i	0
just	0
go	1
with	0
whatever	1
i	0
want	1
to	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
would	0
do	0
too	1

yeah	0
i	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

or	0
or	0
whatever	0
i	0
have	0
[laughter-that's]	0

there's	1
yeah	1
there's	1
a	0
a	0
few	1
designs	0
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
done	0
myself	1
but	0
not	1
very	0
many	1
real	0
simple	1
ones	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
do	1
i've	0
made	1
i	0
made	1
a	0
little	1
uh	0
uh	0
little	1
uh	0
little	0
thumb	0
print	1
and	0
made	1
it	0
a	0
bunny	1

ooh	0

it	0
was	0
really	0
easy	0
i	0
mean	0
just	1
just	1
did	0
a	0
thumb	0
print	1
you	0
know	1

what	0
with	0
ink	0

uh-huh	0

oh	0
okay	0

and	0
then	1
see	0
i	0
didn't	1
cross	1
stitch	0
the	0
actual	1
thumb	1
print	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
was	1
just	0
the	0
ink	1
and	0
then	0
i	0
made	1
the	0
ears	1
and	0
little	0
eyes	1
and	0
nose	1
and	0
mouth	1
that	0
was	0
so	0
simple	0
[laughter-and]	0

oh	0
that	0
sounds	0
really	0
neat	0

it	0
didn't	1
take	0
anything	1
at	0
all	1
and	0

did	0
you	0
do	1
did	0
you	0
use	1
like	0
a	0
stamp	0
pad	1
an	0
ink	1
okay	0

um-hum	0
and	0
then	0
i	0
just	0

okay	0
so	0
you	0
just	0
just	0
like	0
being	0
finger	0
printed	0

i	1
pay	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
taxes	1
i	1
guess	1
because	1
i	1
i	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
amount	1
of	1
money	1
and	1
uh	1
the	1
taxes	1
that	1
i	1
pay	1
um	0
i	1
guess	1
as	1
a	1
as	0
a	0
general	1
statement	0
i	1
feel	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
get	0
my	0
money's	1
worth	0
for	1

okay	1

i'm	1
not	1
sure	1
though	0
whether	1
i	1
feel	1
i	0
guess	0
i	0
am	0
sure	0
that	0
i	0
feel	1
that	0
in	0
general	1
though	1
uh	0
the	0
allocation	0
uh	0
of	0
the	0
taxes	0
in	0
certain	0
areas	0
i[sn't]	0
isn't	0
correct	0

well	0
i'm	1
sure	1
that	1
uh	0
probably	1
every	0
person	0
in	0
this	0
country	1
would	0
agree	1
with	1
you	1
on	0
that	1
because_1	0
everybody	1
has	1
a	0
different	1
idea	1
of	1
where	0
the	0
money	0
should	0
go	1

well	1
i	0
i	1
lately	1
i	0
guess	1
um	1
uh	1
or	0
at	0
least	0
for	1
the	0
last	0
t[wenty]	1
twenty	1
years	0
or	0
so	1
i've	0
felt	0
that	1
the	0
expenditures	1
of	0
our	0
taxes	0
into	0
high	0
cost	0
uh	1
defense	0
items	0
at	1
least	0
in	0
the	0
last	0
ten	0
years	0
have	1
been	0
uh	0
there's	0
been	0
and	0
extraordinary	1
amount	1
of	0
money	0
spent	1
there	1
and	0
i'm	0
not	1
really	0
sure	1
that	0
that	1
we've	0
gotten	0
our	0
money's	1
worth	0
there	1
uh	0
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
outcome	0
of	0
the	0
Desert	0
Storm	1
uh	0
Desert	0
Shield	1
uh	0
situations	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

uh	1
i	0
guess	1
my	1
particular	1
beef	1
is	1
that	0
having	1
participated	1
in	0
the	1
mi[litary]	1
military	1
off	1
and	0
on	1
over	0
the	1
over	0
the	0
years	1
of	0
being	0
called	0
back	1
and	0
things	0
of	0
that	0
nature	1
is	0
uh	0
i've	0
found	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
there's	0
an	0
extraordinary	1
amount	0
of	0
waste	1
i	0
take	1
that	0
as	0
a	0
as	0
a	0
given	1
in	0
any	0
military	0
operation	1
and	0

oh	1
yeah	1
no	0
argument	0
here	1

yeah	1
and	0
i	0
gue[ss]	0
i	0
i	0
should	0
imagine	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
what	0
the	0
what	0
the	0
problem	0
why	0
i	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
a	0
little	1
concerned	1
about	0
today	1
is	0
that	1
this	0
uh	0
rather	1
uh	1
quick	1
and	0
and	0
easy	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0
shouldn't	0
say	0
easy	0
rather	0
quick	0
victory	0
in	0
the	0
in	0
in	0
the	0
uh	0
Mideast	0
uh	0
uh	0
over	0
the	0
uh	0
Iraqis	0
uh	0
might	1
lead	0
us	0
into	0
uh	1
a	0
false	0
sense	0
of	0
security	1
that	0
we	1
can	0
do	1
that	0
against	0
any	0
other	0
foe	0
i'm	1
i	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
what	1
other	0
foe	1
that	0
would	0
be	1
but	1
uh	0
i	0
i'm	1
just	0
getting	0
nervous	1
again	1
now	1
hearing	0
the	0
voices	1
come	1
up	0
that	0
there	0
has	0
to	0
be	1
increased	0
expenditures	1
in	0
that	0
area	1

yeah	0
well	1
of	0
course	1
uh	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
missiles	1
and	0
things	0
were	0
expended	1
in	0
the	0
course	1
of	0
fighting	0
the	0
war	1
and	0
the	1
and	0
the	0
inventory's	1
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	1
be	0
restocked	1
uh	0
on	0
now	0
i	1
work	1
for	0
TI	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	0
things	0
we	0
were	0
told	0
is	1
like	0
they	0
had	0
eleven	1
thousand	0
Harm	1
missiles	1
which	0
TI	1
is	0
the	0
sole	0
supplier	1
for	0
and	0
they	0
used	0
up	0
two	0
thousand	1
of	0
them	0
in	1
in	0
the	0
war	1
so	0
they're	1
going	1
to	0
have	1
to	1
do	1
another	0
contract	1
to	1
restock	1
that	1
to	0
get	1
ready	1
in	0
case	1
something	1
else	1
is	1
needed	1

yeah	1
but	0
it	0
it	0
it	0
it	0
would	0
that	1
be	0
uh	0
well	0
let's	0
see	0
two	0
thousand	1
out	0
of	0
eleven	0
thousand	1
that's	0
about	1
a	0
little	0
over	1
twenty	1
per	0
cent	1
uh	0
i	1
i	1
should	0
imagine	1
that	1
that	0
would	1
be	1
to	1
keep	1
it	0
at	0
a	0
level	1
those	0
levels	1
i	0
guess	1
that	1
that	0
were	0
originally	1
appropriated	1
w[as]	0
was	0
when	1
the	1
Soviet	1
threat	1
i	0
guess	1
was	0
perceived	1
as	0
being	1
a	0
greater	1
one	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
there's	0
very	0
much	0
of	0
a	0
threat	1
there	0
today	1
i	0
do	1
worry	1
about	1
what	1
nuclear	1
weapons	0
are	0
left	1
in	1
the	1
territories	1
uh	0
in	1
their	0
territory	1
over	0
there	1
and	0
who's	1
controlling	1
them	0
but	0

that	1
that's	0
true	0
that's	0
true	1

i	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
what	0
amount	1
of	0
what	0
amount	1
of	0
our	0
hardware	1
would	0
stop	1
some	0
fanatic	1
i	1
guess	0
from	0
doing	1
anything	1
uh	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
irrational	1

well	1
of	1
of	0
course	0
now	0
we	0
used	1
up	0
twenty	1
per	1
cents	1
per	0
cent	1
of	0
that	0
inventory	1
in	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0
just	0
a	0
few	0
weeks	1

right	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
uh	0
uh	0
TI	1
also	0
makes	0
the	0
missile	0
which	0
was	1
the	1
the	0
TV	1
laser	1
guided	0
bombs	1

yeah	0

and	1
and	0
a	0
big	0
percentage	1
of	1
that	1
was	0
expended	1
as	0
well	1
that	0
that	1
w[as]	0
that	0
was	0
just	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0

w[hat]	0
what	1
is	0
the	0
name	0
of	0
that	1

uh	0
it's	0
called	0
Paveway	0

yes	0
yes	0

and	0
uh	1
a	1
big	1
percentage	1
of	1
that	0
was	1
used	0
up	1
during	1
that	0
conflict	1
also	1
so	1
tho[se]	1
those	1
are	1
two	1
areas	1
in	1
which	1
TI	1
stands	1
to	0
to	1
gain	1
some	1
some	1
short	1
term	0
business	1
to	0
restock	1
that	0

yeah	0
well	0
i	0
i	0
i'm	0
what	0
i'm	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	0
uh	0
it	0
concerned	0
about	0
talking	0
about	0
the	0
taxes	1
in	0
general	1
and	0
that	1
that	0
was	0
an	0
area	1
that	0
i	1
i	0
perceive	1
as	0
not	1
being	1
the	0
best	0
expenditure	1
for	0
the	0
amount	1
of	0
dollar	1
that	0
we're	0
taxed	1
for	0
uh	0
in	0
the	0
area	0
of	0
defense	0
or	0
perhaps	1
we	0
have	1
paid	0
too	0
much	0
there	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it	0
just	1
seems	0
to	0
me	1
that	0
over	0
the	0
years	1
now	1
the	1
and	1
and	0
it's	1
it's	0
a	0
cliche	1
i	0
i	0
but	0
i	0
see	1
it	0
myself	1
i	0
see	1
where	0
the	0
infrastructure	1
is	1
sort	0
of	0
breaking	0
down	0
the	0
roads	1
the	0
highways	1

oh	0
no	0
doubt	0

i	0
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
i	0
kn[ow]	0
i'm	0
familiar	0
with	0
some	0
some	0
upbeat	0
school	0
areas	0
so	0
i	0
don't	1
totally	1
agree	0
with	0
the	1
the	0
great	1
uh	0
uh	1
with	1
the	0
with	0
the	1
great	1
ex[penditure]	1
expenditure	1
of	0
effort	1
and	1
time	1
there	0
but	0
i	0
guess	0
overall	1
because	0
i	0
guess	0
i'm	0
not	0
associated	1
with	0
what	1
ghetto	1
schools	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
and	0
uh	0
rural	1
school	0
systems	0
are	0
like	1
i	1
i	0
should	0
imagine	0
that	1
would	0
take	0
an	0
enormous	0
expenditure	1

yeah	0
as	1
a	0
matter	1
of	1
fact	0
in	1
Texas	1
um	0
we've	0
had	1
our	0
school	0
funding	1
system	0
declared	0
unconstitutional	1
by	1
the	1
a	0
state	1
judge	1
and	1
they	0
and	0
uh	0
the	0
legislature	1
just	0
passed	0
what	0
they	0
called	0
a	1
Robin	1
Hood	0
Bill	1
which	1
basically	0
what	0
it	0
does	0
is	0
it	0
takes	0
extra	1
money	0
from	1
the	1
more	0
affluent	1
school	1
districts	1
that	0
are	0
that	0
are	0
you	0
know	1
come	0
from	0
local	1
taxes	1
and	0
send	1
them	0
to	0
other	1
parts	0
of	0
the	0
state	1
that	0
are	0
not	1
so	0
affluent	1

um-hum	0

that	1
they	0
don't	0
have	1
a	0
broad	0
based	0
income	0
tax	1
that	0
funds	1
the	0
educational	0
system	1
or	0

uh	0
well	0

or	0
is	0
it	0
all	0
funded	1
out	0
of	0
local	1
taxes	1

okay	0
to	0
g[ive]	1
to	0
give	1
you	0
some	0
perspective	1
this	1
this	0
town	1
that	0
i	1
had	0
lived	1
in	0
for	0
sometime	1
in	0
nineteen	1
eighty	0
three	1
was	0
funded	1
sixty	0
five	0
per	0
cent	0
by	0
state	0
funds	1

yeah	0

then	0
we	0
had	1
a	0
number	0
of	0
education	1
reforms	1
that	1
the	1
legislature	1
said	0
hey	1
we	1
got	0
to	0
do	1
this	1
we	0
got	0
to	1
do	0
this	1
we	1
got	0
to	0
do	0
this	1
but	1
they	0
forgot	1
to	1
put	1
in	0
the	0
state	1
budget	1
the	0
money	1
to	1
pay	1
for	0
it	0
and	1
they	0
dumped	1
it	0
all	1
on	0
the	0
local	1
school	1
districts	1
so	0

sounds	1
like	0
the	0
way	0
the	0
federal	1
and	0
state	0
system	0
works	0
[laughter-now]	1

really	0
so	1

yeah	0

so	1
so	0
what	0
ended	0
up	0
happening	0
was	0
was	0
a	0
was	1
a	0
shift	1
we	0
went	0
to	0
sixty	1
five	1
per	0
cent	0
state	1
funding	1
to	1
sixty	0
five	0
per	1
cent	1
local	1
funding	1
in	0
a	0
matter	1
of	0
four	1
years	1
and	0
uh	1
i	0
mean	0

uh	0
do	0
you	0
mean	1
a	0
a	0
complete	0
reversal	1
because	0
i	0
guess	0
they	0
can't	1
raise	0
that	0
money	1
in	0
those	1
those	0
poorer	0
districts	1
huh	0

oh	0
complete	0
complete	1
it's	0
all	1
shifted	0
to	0
local	1
districts	1
and	0
now	1
even	0
the	0
money	0
that's	0
been	0
raised	1
for	1
the	0
local	1
districts	0
is	0
being	1
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
siphoned	1
off	0
and	0
sent	1
to	0
other	0
parts	0
of	0
the	0
state	1

that's	0
right	0
and	1
and	0
i	1
have	0
i	0
have	1
no	0
problem	1
with	1
uh	0
a	0
certain	1
uh	0
floor	0
level	1
minimum	1
level	1
that's	0
a	0
standard	1
uh	0
that	0
everybody	1
uh	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
have	1
uh	0

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
am	1
opposed	0
to	1
any	1
attempts	0
to	0
restrict	1
um	0
local	1
communities	0
from	0
taxing	1
themselves	0
above	1
that	0
to	0
provide	1
above	0
the	0
minimum	1

yes	0
i	0
see	1
what	0
you're	0
saying	1
uh	0
i	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
do	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
am	0
a	0
s[trong]	1
uh	0
a	0
strong	1
and	0
staunch	0
supporter	1
of	0
some	1
subsidy	1
for	0
any	1
forms	0
of	0
education	1
i	0
mean	1
by	0
that	1
i	0
mean	1
i'm	0
a	0
product	1
myself	1
i	0
have	1
uh	0
a	0
a	0
a	1
a	0
background	1
of	0
uh	0
being	1
uh	0
getting	0
my	0
college	1
education	1
through	0
the	0
GI	0
Bill	1

so	0
did	0
i	0
my	0
Master's	0
anyway	0

what	0
but	0
uh	1
when	0
i	0
look	1
at	0
it	0
to	0
me	1
uh	0
it	0
doesn't	1
really	0
make	0
any	0
difference	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
marvelous	1
opportunity	0
that	0
i	1
couldn't	1
have	0
done	1
i	0
don't	1
think	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
gone	0
on	1
unless	0
i	0
had	1
that	1
financial	1
uh	0
easement	1
made	0
possible	1

yeah	0

that's	0
right	0

and	0
i	1
i	0
don't	0
really	0
care	1
what	0
it	0
takes	1
to	0
qualify	1
whether	0
you're	1
uh	0
an	1
an	1
[laughter-whether]	1
[laughter-you're]	0
[laughter-a]	0
[laughter-veteran]	1
or	1
whether	0
you	1
i	0
don't	0
even	0
know	1
if	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
perform	1
community	0
service	1
or	0
unless	1
uh	0
or	1
or	0
you	0
promise	1
to	0
even	1
do	0
something	0
in	0
the	0
future	1
i	1
think	0
that	1
uh	0
the	1
that	0
that	0
the	0
subsidy	1
itself	1
or	1
i	0
guess	1
the	0
enactment	1
of	0
that	0
form	1
of	0
legislation	1
would	1
give	0
many	1
people	0
who	1
i	0
i	1
think	1
i	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
perceive	1
the	0
fact	1
at	0

uh-huh	0

at	0
least	0
what	0
i	0
read	0
is	0
that	0
some	0
younger	1
people	0
feel	0
that	0
education	1
is	0
priced	0
out	0
of	0
their	1
uh	0
out	0
of	0
their	1
uh	0
budget	1
i	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
state	0
of	0
Florida	0
just	0
today	0
uh	0
the	0
the	0
legislature	0
uh	0
adjourned	0
and	1
uh	0
they	0
had	0
completed	1
a	0
fifteen	1
per	0
cent	0
increase	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	1
uh	0
state	1
land	0
grant	0
colleges	1
which	1
which	0
isn't	1
i	0
mean	1
to	0
me	1
it	0
doesn't	0
sound	0
like	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
money	1
but	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
would	1
be	0
for	0
fifteen	0
hundred	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
they	0

uh-huh	0

they	0
went	0
from	0
eleven	1
to	0
fifteen	0
hundred	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
for	0
an	0
out	1
of	0
state	1
student	0
the	0
tuition	1
went	0
up	0
twenty	0
five	1
per	0
cent	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
what	0
that	0
would	0
be	1

yeah	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
raise	1
uh	0
community	1
college	0
taxes	0
here	1
a	0
few	0
years	1
ago	1
too	0

but	0
that	1
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
that	0
goes	0
along	1
with	0
the	0
general	0
idea	1
that	0
the	0
federal	1
government	0
had	0
to	1
uh	0
was	0
expending	1
so	1
much	0
money	0
on	0
defense	1
uh	0
that	1
that	1
the	1
program	0
now	1
is	0
a	0
uh	0
program	1
now	1
is	0
uh	0
fees	1
that	1
that	1
fund	1
these	0
things	1
i	0
guess	0
that's	0
trickled	1
down	0
to	0
the	0
states	1
and	1
the	0
states	1
now	0
establish	1
uh	0
don't	0
have	1
enough	0
money	1
so	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
they	1
they	0
must	0
charge	0
fees	1
uh	0
i	0
i	0
i'm	0
not	0
too	0
sure	0
of	0
that	0
reasoning	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	0
guess	1
to	0
get	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
main	1
topic	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
whether	1
i	0
pay	0
too	0
much	0
taxes	1
i	1
i	1
i	0
travel	1
extensively	0
in	0
Europe	1
and	0
see	1
enormous	1
uh	0
people	0
p[ay]	1
pay	1
uh	0
a	0
great	0
deal	1
in	0
taxes	1
they	0
tell	0
me	0
when	0
i	0
sit	1
and	0
talk	0
to	0
people	0
there	0
they	0
tell	1
me	0
they	1
they	1
some	0
states	0
they	0
pay	0
uh	0
in	0
Germany	1
or	0
in	0
in	0
England	1
in	0
some	1
cases	0
people	1
in	0
my	0
income	0
level	1
at	0
least	1
allege	1
that	0
they	0
pay	1
up	0
to	0
six	1
fifty	1
five	0
percent	0
of	0
their	1
gross	0
income	1
in	0
taxes	1

oh	1
oh	0
i	0
can	1
believe	0
that	1

but	0
but	0
i'm	0
not	1
too	0
sure	1
when	0
i	0
put	0
my	0
property	1
tax	0
in	1
my	0
car	1
tax	1
my	0
income	1
tax	1
and	1
these	0
myriad	1
of	0
uh	0
now	1
it	0
costs	0
me	0
money	1
to	0
leave	0
the	0
country	1
some	0
sort	0
of	0
a	0
tax	1
to	0
leave	0
the	0
country	1
some	0
sort	0
of	0
an	0
airport	1
departure	1
tax	1
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
tax	1
a	0
sales	1
tax	0
which	0
is	0
getting	1
to	0
uh	0
quite	0
high	0
levels	1

yep	0
yeah	0

i'm	0
not	0
sure	1
that	0
i'm	0
not	1
up	1
fairly	1
close	0
to	0
that	1

well	0
i	0
guarantee	1
you	0
you'd	0
be	0
paying	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
in	0
taxes	1
i[f]	1
if	0
uh	0
the	0
Democrats	1
had	0
more	0
say	1

you	0
really	0
think	0
so	0

yeah	0
i	0
really	0
do	0

but	0
i	0
mean	0
w[hat]	0
what's	0
what's	0
happened	0
here	0
is	0
is	0
is	0
i	1
feel	0
that	0
that	0
in	0
the	0
last	1
ten	1
years	1
uh	0
my	0
taxes	1
have	0
gone	0
up	1
they	0
haven't	1
gone	0
down	1
i	0
pay	1
uh	0
quite	1
a	0
bit	0
more	0
taxes	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
and	0
and	0

every	0
everybody	0
is	0

but	0
that's	0
been	1
a	0
Republican	0
government	1
for	0
the	0
last	0
ten	0
years	1

well	0
what	0
what	0
what	0
they've	1
been	0
able	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
slow	0
down	0
the	0
rate	0
of	0
increase	0
to	0
keep	0
it	0
to	0
keep	0
it	0
b[ecoming]	0
from	0
becoming	0
even	0
more	0
obnoxious	0

well	0
i	0

yeah	0

well	0
this	0
has	0
been	0
really	0
interesting	0
and	0
i've	0
enjoyed	1
our	0
talk	1

okay	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
just	0
push	1
something	0
here	1
push	0
one	0
again	0
right	0

no	0
you	0
just	0
uh	0
we	0
just	0
say	0
say	0
good-bye	0
and	0
that's	0
it	0

just	0
hang	0
up	0
okay	0
Don	0
good	0
talking	0
with	0
you	0

nice	0
talking	0
with	0
you	0
too	0

bye-bye	0

bye-bye	0

the	1
AIDS	1
issue	1
is	1
is	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
problem	1
i	1
guess	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
immediate	1
friends	1
with	0
that	1
problem	1
is	1
is	1
the	0
financial	1
end	1
i	0
mean	1
how	1
can	1
a	0
country	1
stand	1
to	0
uh	0
spend	1
as	0
much	1
or	0
much	0
more	1
than	0
they	0
already	0
are	1
on	0
such	0
a	0
problem	1
uh	0
but	0
then	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thinking	1
is	0
also	0
tempered	1
with	0
the	1
the	0
knowledge	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
the	0
the	0
rumor	1
i'm	1
not	0
really	0
sure	1
if	0
it's	1
true	1
or	0
not	1
that	0
uh	1
we're	0
not	0
spending	1
as	0
much	1
per	1
let's	0
say	1
afflicted	1
person	1
on	0
cancer	1
uh	0
there's	1
some	1
uh	0
take	0
breast	1
cancer	0
for	1
instance	1
it	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
doing	0
much	1
more	0
damage	1
and	0
affecting	0
much	1
more	0
peo[ple]	1
mean	0
more	0
people	1
than	0
AIDS	1
and	0
yet	1
uh	0
more	1
people	0
die	1
of	0
it	0
and	0
yet	0
the	0
funding	1
is	0
already	1
uh	0
exceeded	1
AIDS	1
has	0
more	0
money	1
than	0
uh	0
breast	1
cancer	0

and	1
well	1
that's	1
interesting	1
isn't	1
it	1
yeah	1

so	1
uh	0
i	1
mean	0
if	1
it's	0
true	1
i	0
i've	1
i've	0
always	1
heard	1
these	0
things	0
i've	0
never	0
bothered	1
to	0
dig	1
it	0
out	0
and	0
make	0
sure	1
but	0
uh	0
i've	0
heard	1
it	0
on	0
more	1
than	0
one	0
documentary	1
that	1
uh	0
they	0
were	0
complaining	1
that	1
whoever's	1
sitting	0
up	0
there	0
making	1
these	1
decisions	1
uh	0
or	0
whatever	0
institutions	1
raise	0
the	0
money	1
and	0
uh	1
it's	0
just	0
one	0
big	1
PR	1
campaign	1
that	0
yeah	1
we	0
think	1
that's	0
the	0
world's	1
worst	0
thing	1
so	0
let's	1
give	0
money	1
to	0
AIDS	1
and	0
yet	1
we've	0
had	0
breast	1
cancer	0
problems	0
for	0
years	1

right	1

and	1
it's	0
just	0
one	1
of	0
those	0
well	0
of	0
course	0
one	1
of	0
the	1
shows	1
i	0
saw	1
was	0
taking	1
it	0
from	1
the	0
angle	1
that	0
since	0
it	1
doesn't	0
effect	0
men	1
it's	0
not	1
gonna	0
get	1
funded	1
and	1
uh	0
having	0
thought	1
about	0
that	1
for	0
a	1
while	1

what	1
did	0
you	1
think	1
about	0
that	1
idea	0

well	1
i	1
i	0
kind	1
of	0
i	0
thought	1
well	1
that	0
that	1
might	0
be	0
possible	1
since	0
there	0
are	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
men	1
in	0
control	1
of	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
but	0
then	1
i	0
go[t]	1
i	1
got	0
to	0
thinking	1
the	0
the	0
number	0
one	0
killer	1
of	0
men	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
prostate	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
one	1
test	1
that	0
just	1
recently	1
got	0
developed	1
uh	0
a	0
blood	0
an[tigen]	1
antigen	1
uh	0
antibody	1
test	1
for	0
the	0
antigen	1
in	0
the	0
blood	1
and	0
that's	1
fairly	0
recent	1
and	0
yet	0
men	1
have	0
been	0
dying	0
from	0
prostate	1
cancer	0
for	0
years	1

they've	0
not	1
really	0
given	0
it	0
attention	0
either	1
yeah	1

so	1
it's	1
not	0
really	0
cure	1
f[or]	0
yeah	1
it's	1
not	0
uh	0
not	1
that	0
heavily	0
funded	1
either	1
and	0
that	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
major	1
uh	0
problems	1
that	0
men	1
have	0
in	0
the	0
realm	0
of	0
cancer	1
so	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	0
just	1
some	0
strange	1
public	1
opinion	1
as	0
to	0
who	0
they	1
want	0
to	0
give	1
to	0
um	0
be	1
it	0
through	1
different	1
organizations	1
March	0
of	0
Dimes	1
type	1
uh	0
telethons	1
or	0
or	0
bicycle	1
rides	0
or	0
whatever	1
how	1
they	0
fund	1
whatever	1
um	0
illness	1
they	0
wish	1

right	1

it's	0
kind	1
of	0
hard	1
to	0
to	0
get	1
an	0
even	1
keel	1
on	0
that	1
i	0
mean	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	1
to	0
say	1
well	1
there's	1
you	0
know	0
a	0
hundred	0
thousand	1
per	0
year	1
affected	0
by	0
this	1
one	0
so	0
let's	0
give	0
it	0
this	1
amount	1
and	0
then	0
this	0
other	1
one's	0
only	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	0
so	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	1
and	1
and	0
just	0
keep	1
doling	1
it	0
out	0
that	1
way	0
or	0

well	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
glad	1
i'm	1
not	1
the	0
one	1
that's	0
that's	1
in	0
charge	1
of	0
of	1
making	1
those	1
decisions	1
they	1
uh	1
you	1
wish	1
that	0
there	1
could	0
just	1
be	0
money	1
for	0
all	1
these	0
problems	1
because_1	0
they're	1
all	0
so	1
serious	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
mean	1
it's	0
not	1
so	0
serious	1
i	1
guess	1
until	1
it	0
affects	1
your	0
family	1
and	1
then	0
all	1
the	1
sudden	1
it's	1
the	0
most	1
important	0
thing	0

right	1

so	1
i	0
i	0
would	0
hate	1
to	1
have	0
that	1
responsibility	1
just	0
personally	1
but	1
but	0
then	0
again	1
we	0
really	1
we	0
really	0
do	1
have	0
it	1
as	0
a	0
society	1
just	0
decides	1
which	1
things	0
we	0
need	1
to	0
address	1
i	1
uh	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
it	1
it	1
frightens	1
me	0
to	1
think	1
of	0
so	1
many	0
people	0
with	1
with	1
AIDS	0
and	1
with	1
cancer	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
those	0
things	0
um	0
if	1
they're	0
not	1
able	1
to	0
to	0
be	0
insured	1
then	0
the	0
country's	1
gonna	0
pay	1
for	1
it	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
the	0
other	1
whether	1
it's	1
through	0
prevention	1
or	0
or	1
treatment	1
or	1
you	1
know	1
just	1
uh	1
just	0
helping	1
the	0
people	1
when	0
they	0
are	0
not	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	0
themselves	1

right	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
one	0
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
we're	0
gonna	0
end	0
up	0
paying	1
for	0
it	0

that's	0
true	1

just	1

you	0
know	1
the	1
the	0
other	1
thought	1
that	0
i	0
had	1
um	0
i've	0
had	1
several	1
minutes	1
to	0
think	1
about	0
this	0
after	1
i	0
uh	0
while	1
i	0
was	0
finding	1
people	0
i	1
uh	0
i	0
could	0
think	1
about	0
the	0
topic	1
longer	1
than	0
the	0
person	0
that	0
receives	1
it	0
so	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
a	0
unfair	1
advantage	1
as	0
they	0
were	1
but	0

but	0
the	0
other	1
thing	0
that	0
i've	0
thought	1
of	0
on	0
this	1
is	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
there	0
isn't	1
enough	0
money	1
uh	0
in	0
our	0
economy	1
or	0
in	0
our	0
system	1
uh	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
there's	0
so	1
much	1
that	0
goes	1
to	0
things	0
that	0
don't	1
really	1
do	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	0
of	0
good	0
i	0
mean	1
yeah	1
they're	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
but	1
we	0
have	0
such	1
an	0
affluent	1
[s]ociety	1
society	1
that	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
if	0
we	1
took	0
a	0
little	1
from	0
here	1
and	0
there	0
and	0
the	0
other	1
if	0
we	0
might	1
wind	1
up	0
with	0
a	0
uh	0
cure	1
for	0
just	0
about	0
everything	1
of	0

just	1
change	1
our	0
p[riorities]	0

of	0
course	0
then	0
we	0
wouldn't	0
have	0
any	0
room	1
to	0
put	0
people	1
but	1
[laughter-that's]	0

right	1
just	1
change	1
our	0
priorities	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
ridiculous	1
figures	0
for	0
pizza	1
or	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
these	0
phenomenal	1
amount	0
of	0
dollars	1
spent	0
for	0
this	1
that	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
all	1
the	0
arts	1
that	0
that	0
are	0
nice	1
and	0
aesthetic	1
but	0
are	0
they	1
that	1
enhancing	1
for	0
the	1
m[asses]	0
for	0
the	1
masses	1
you	0
know	1
they	0

right	1

they	0
certainly	1
do	0
well	1
for	0
those	0
who	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
symphony	1
orchestra	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
but	0
uh	0
had	0
all	1
that	0
donation	1
and	0
time	1
and	0
labor	1
and	0
effort	1
gone	1
toward	0
something	0
else	1

uh	1
being	1
a	0
former	1
drug	1
user	1
i	1
uh	0
i'd	1
i	1
guess	1
i	0
have	1
to	1
say	1
at	0
this	1
point	0
that	0
i	0
do	1
approve	1
of	0
it	0

whoa	1

uh-huh	0

uh	1
because	0
i	0
know	1
that	1
uh	0
in	1
using	1
drugs	1
i	1
was	0
not	1
a	1
good	1
employee	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
so	1
i	1
can	0
see	1
from	0
the	1
company's	1
standpoint	1
that	1
there	1
uh	1
whenever	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
employee	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
you	1
are	0
using	1
it's	0
assets	1
and	1
uh	0
a[nd]	1
bu[t]	1
you're	0
also	1
under	1
their	0
liability	1
under	0
the	1
Workmen's	1
Comp	1

uh-huh	0

uh	1
on	0
my	1
job	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
Workmen's	1
Comp	0
cases	1
and	1
uh	0
i	0
work	1
for	1
a	0
tire	1
company	1
Modern	1
Tire	1

where	1
do	0
you	0
work	1

oh	1

and	1
uh	1
it's	1
also	1
a	0
retreading	1
plant	1
and	0
that's	1
where	0
most	0
of	1
our	1
uh	0
injuries	1
occur	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
what	0
we	1
do	1
is	0
we'll	1
have	0
a	0
drug	1
test	0
i[f]	0
if	1
an	1
if	1
a	1
a	0
boy	1
or	0
a	1
man	1
uh	1
has	1
an	0
accident	1
then	1
he's	1
automatically	1
uh	0
given	0
a	0
drug	1
test	1

right	1
do	0
they	0
do	1
it	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
within	0
hours	1
of	0
the	0
accident	1
or	0
is	0
it	1

yes	1
when	0
he	0
goes	1
to	0
the	0
doctor	1
the	0
first	0
time	1

yeah	0

and	1
so	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
uh	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
if	0
it's	1
been	1
a	1
deterrent	1
or	0
not	1
because	0
we	1
have	0
uh	0
just	1
started	0
using	1
it	0
oh	1
for	0
the	0
past	0
year	1
or	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

now	0
we've	1
let	1
some	0
people	0
go	1
uh	0
that	0
well	0
it	0
was	0
found	0
that	0
drugs	1
were	0
used	1
in	0
their	0
system	1
now	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
how	1
TEC	1
would	0
handle	1
it	0
they	1
haven't	0
pursued	1
it	0
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

uh	0
if	0
there's	1
some	1
uh	0
problem	1
i	0
know	1
there	1
was	0
one	1
guy	1
that	0
we	1
tested	1
for	0
preemployment	1
for	0
drugs	1
who	1
absolutely	1
swore	1
up	0
and	0
down	1
that	1
it	0
showed	1
that	0
he	0
was	0
using	1
amphetamines	1
and	0
he	1
went	0
to	1
a	0
a	1
separate	1
drug	0
testing	1
firm	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
they	1
showed	0
it	1
negative	1

huh	1

so	1
i	0
think	1
the	0
tests	1
themselves	1
are	0
not	1
really	0
that	1
cut	1
and	1
dried	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
probably	0
true	1
too	1
that's	1
that's	1
that's	1
sort	0
of	0
scary	1

uh-huh	1
really	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
also	1
had	0
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	1
uh	0
just	0
around	1
some	0
people	1
that	1
were	1
smoking	1
cocaine	1

yeah	1

and	0
he	1
tested	0
positive	0
on	1
cocaine	1
now	1
then	1
you	0
always	1
wonder	1
well	1
is	0
he	1
just	1
saying	0
that	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
yeah	1
really	1
really	1

yeah	0

yeah	1
that's	1
that's	1
a	0
bad	1
situation	1
i	1
think	0
that	0
probably	1
i	1
think	0
most	1
companies	0
now	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
entry	1
you	1
know	0
exams	1
require	1
that	0
i	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

i	1
think	0
they	0
should	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	1
a	0
TI	1
employee	1
and	1
and	1
and	1
uh	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
really	0
gung	1
ho	0
for	1
it	0
in	0

uh-huh	0

in	0
fact	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
places	1
now	1
um	0
like	0
IBM	1
don't	1
allow	1
even	0
smoking	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
plant	1

uh-huh	0

right	1

we	1
we	1
have	0
designated	1
smoking	1
areas	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
work	1
in	0
sort	1
of	0
a	0
building	1
that's	0
that's	0
not	1
really	1
it	1
well	0
it's	0
on	1
the	0
campus	1
of	0
the	0
TI	0
facility	1
but	0
it's	0
a	0
little	1
bit	1
you	1
know	0
separated	1
we	0
lease	1
the	0
building	1
and	1
it's	1
m[ainly]	0
it's	0
a	1
factory	1
environment	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
they	1
they	0
have	0
designated	1
smoking	1
but	0
it's	0
just	1
wide	1
open	1
it's	0
not	1
ventilated	1
properly	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
think	1
that's	0
bad	1
but	0
as	0
far	1
as	1
the	0
drugs	1
you	1
know	0
being	1
in	0
the	0
factory	1
kind	1
of	0
environment	1
that	0
way	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
a	0
it's	0
a	0
definite	1
i	1
think	0
it's	0
essential	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

yeah	1
because	0
you're	1
endangering	1
everybody's	1
lives	1
if	0
you've	0
if	0
it's	0
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	1

in	0
fact	1
we've	0
had	1
the	0
policy	1
on	0
just	0
the	0
random	1
testing	1
now	1
for	1
a	0
couple	0
years	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
was	1
giving	1
my	0
boss	1
a	0
hard	0
time	1
because	1
i	1
kept	0
waiting	1
for	0
my	0
name	1
to	0
came	1
come	0
up	1
you	1
know	1
they	1

they	1
never	1
they	1
never	1
called	1
me	1
they	0
never	1
you	1
know	0
then	0
finally	1
the	0
day	1
we	0
declared	0
war	1
was	0
my	0
time	1

[laughter-you're]	1
kidding	1

[laughter-no]	1
and	1
so	1
and	1
and	0
my	0
boss	1
has	1
has	0
gone	1
for	0
about	0
like	1
three	1
times	1
i	0
think	1
and	0
i	0
told	1
him	1
he's	0
obviously	1
in	0
a	0
high	1
risk	0
group	1

the	0
executives	1
right	1

right	1
right	1
and	0
of	0
course	1
you	1
know	0
they	1
they	0
did	1
specifically	1
single	0
them	1
out	0
when	0
we	0
started	1
you	1
know	0
that	0
they	1
were	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
all	0
them	0
first	1

the	0
executives	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
wouldn't	1
that	0
be	0
awful	1
if	0
you	1
were	0
if	0
you	1
were	0
using	1
and	1
and	1
oh	1
lose	1
your	0
job	1
and	0
everything	1

which	0
i	1
thought	0
was	1
[laughter-interesting]	1

oh	1
man	1
yeah	1

ooh	1
yeah	1

i	1
can't	0
believe	1
i'd	0
was	0
so	1
brazen	1
before	1
i'm	1
like	1
i	0
say	1
i'm	0
a	0
former	1
drug	1
user	1
but	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
uh	0
i	1
i	1
well	1
uh	0
i	0
accepted	0
Christ	1
as	0
my	0
Lord	1
and	0
Savior	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
don't	1
use	0
drugs	0
any	0
more	1

what	1
kind	1
of	0
drugs	0
did	0
you	0
use	1
if	0
you	1
don't	0
mind	1

uh	0
marijuana	1
cocaine	1
and	0
amphetamines	1

wow	1

um	0
yes	1
[laughter-uh-huh]	0

and	1
all	1
on	1
the	0
job	1
too	1

really	1

you	0
know	1
it	0
had	0
gotten	1
that	0
bad	1

well	1
it's	0
really	1
lucky	1
that	0
you	0
got	0
away	1
from	0
that	1

really	1

cause	0
that's	1
really	1
downward	1
spiral	1

it's	1
it's	1
life	1
is	0
so	1
much	0
more	0
enjoyable	1

uh-huh	0
and	0
i	1
was	0
losing	1
jobs	1
just	0
from	0
doing	0
a	0
poor	1
job	1
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
that's	1
that's	0
it	1

i	0
mean	1
you	1
know	1
there's	1
all	0
kinds	1
of	0
drawbacks	1
much	0
less	1
the	0
drug	1
testing	1

yeah	1
just	0
life	1
in	0
general	1

uh-huh	0
that's	0
right	1

yeah	1
well	0
i'm	0
well	0
i'm	1
definitely	1
for	1
it	0

yeah	1

plus	1
you	0
know	1
you	1
you	0
want	1
to	0
think	1
that	0
that	0
you're	0
working	1
with	0
people	1
who	1
are	0
not	0
only	0
putting	1
out	0
their	0
fair	0
share	1
but	0
that	0
are	0
not	1
endangering	1
your	0
life	1
in	0

that's	0
right	1

in	0
some	0
cases	1
like	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	1

like	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	1
uh	0
several	1
years	0
back	1
worked	0
for	0
Motorola	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	1
had	1
you	0
know	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
was	1
a	0
chemical	1
handling	1
type	1

oh	0
goodness	1

yeah	1

mean	1
and	0
they	0
have	1

have	0
some	0
serious	1
chemicals	1
out	0
there	1
you	1
know	0
like	1

yeah	1

like	1
they	0
have	1
emergency	1
shower	1
where	0
you	0
just	0
run	1
in	0
there	1
and	0
strip	1
off	1
and	0
dump	1
water	1
you	1
know	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1

yeah	1

and	0
they	1
had	0
people	0
out	0
there	1
using	0
all	0
sorts	1
of	0
drugs	1
handling	1
those	0
chemicals	1

oh	1
my	0
gosh	1

you	0
know	0
that's	1
really	1
that's	1
really	0
frightening	1
so	0

yeah	1

so	0
i	1
think	0
some	0
place	1
you	1
know	0
places	1
like	0
that	1
it	0
should	0
be	1
like	1
mandatory	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
on	0
on	1
a	0
on	0
a	0
greater	1
frequency	1
than	1
than	0
maybe	1
just	0
you	1
know	0
the	1
paper	0
pushers	1
like	1
like	0
i	1
am	0

uh-huh	1

right	1

i	0
would	0
think	1
they	0
would	1
be	0

well	1
you	0
well	1
you'd	0
think	1
so	1
but	1
uh	1

but	1
they	0
weren't	1

i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
[un]til	0
yet	1

isn't	1
that	0
awful	1

because	1
when	0
he	1
was	0
at	0
course	1
now	0
it's	1
been	0
years	1
now	0
because	0
it	1
was	0
before	1
it	1
was	0
even	0
before	1
they	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
designated	1
smoking	1
type	0
stuff	1
you	0
know	0
at	0
TI	1
i	0

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

i	0
forgot	0
what	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
like	1
eighty	1
four	1
eighty	0
five	1
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	1
at	0
that	1
time	1
they	1
had	0
no	0
testing	1
whatsoever	1

huh	0

so	1
that's	1
scary	1

yeah	1
that's	1
reminds	1
me	0
of	0
uh	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	0
telling	0
me	0
about	0
her	0
brother	1
who	0
gets	0
high	1
all	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
have	1
just	0
casually	1
asked	1
her	0
what	0
he	0
did	0
for	0
a	0
living	1
and	0
she	1
said	1
oh	0
he's	0
the	0
supervisor	1
of	0
this	0
chemical	1
land	1
fill	0
you	0
know	1
where	0
they	0
go	1
and	0
dump	1
all	0
this	1
toxic	1
stuff	1

oh	1
Lord	1

oh	1

and	1
i	0
just	1
you	0
know	1
went	0
oh	1
[laughter-where]	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
yeah	1
should	0
we	0
move	1

let	1
me	0
move	1
as	0
far	1
away	0
as	0
possible	1

ooh	1

yeah	1

that's	0
awful	1

but	1
i'm	0
proud	1
though	0
that	1
that	1
um	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
grew	1
up	0
in	0
the	1
sixties	1
and	1
back	0
then	1
it	0
was	0
popular	1
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

but	0
people	1
have	0
really	1
wisened	1
you	1
know	0
become	1
wise	1
about	0
drugs	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
they	0
really	1
have	0
a	0
good	1
campaign	1
for	0
the	0
young	1
people	1
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

they	0
know	1
it's	0
not	0
smart	1
so	1
so	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
a	0
generational	1
thing	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
peer	1
group	1
is	0
the	1
other	0
way	1
now	1
instead	1
of	0

that's	0
right	1
and	0
that's	1
good	1

uh-huh	0
that's	1

that's	0
the	0
best	1
way	1
to	0
stop	1
it	0

yeah	1
that	1
it	0
really	1
is	1

yeah	1
well	1
i	0
think	1
we	0
did	1
it	0

kind	1
of	0
a	1
uh	1
situation	1

well	0
that's	1
good	1

that's	0
good	1

as	1
i	1
say	1
unless	0
it	0
happens	1
to	0
be	0
now	1
yesterday	1
i	1
had	0
to	1
dress	0
up	1
and	1
and	1

formal	1
because	0
i	0
had	1
a	0
a	0
formal	1
meeting	0

noon	1
time	0

um-hum	0

in	0
the	1
day	1
and	0
and	1
be	0
a	0
little	1
more	0
casual	1

well	0

wonderful	1

and	0
then	1
if	1
i	0
have	0
a	0
a	0
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
people	1
that	0
i	1
know	1
i	0
can	0
be	1
very	0
casual	1
in	0
the	1
evening	1

well	1
my	0
husband	1
has	1
to	0
take	0
the	0
bus	0
into	1
Dallas	1
and	0
doesn't	1
return	0
all	1
day	1
so	1
he	1
has	1
to	0
dress	1
and	0
he's	1
just	0
really	0
hates	1
that	0
they	0
have	1
the	0
long	0
sleeve	0
shirts	1
and	1
the	0
whole	0
tie	1
and	0
the	1
whole	1
suit	1
and	0
even	1
when	0
his	0
job	1
is	1
not	1
gonna	0
be	0
with	0
people	1
all	1
day	0
long	1
he	0
said	0
it's	1
just	0
part	1
of	0
the	1
uniform	1
and	1
the	0
expected	1
image	1
that	1
they	1
have	0
to	1
dress	1

yeah	1
that's	0
around	1
here	1
in	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
places	0
that's	1
the	0
way	0
it	0
is	1
i	0

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	0
there	1
there	0
are	1
ex[pected]	0
expected	1
uh	0
dress	0
codes	1

um-hum	0

and	1
the	0
people	1
need	1
to	1
follow	1
that	1
i	1
think	1
uh	1
years	1
ago	1
i	0
used	0
to	1
be	0
far	1
more	0
uh	0
committed	1
to	1
the	0
idea	0
of	0
of	0
a	0
dress	1
code	0

um-hum	1

but	0
i've	1
relaxed	1
a	1
lot	0
more	1
as	0
i've	1
gotten	0
older	1
and	1
become	0
more	1
comfortable	1
with	0
myself	1

well	0
i	1
think	0
that's	0
i	0
think	1
that's	0
great	1
i	0
think	0
that's	0
good	1

it's	0
taken	1
a	0
long	0
time	1
to	0
break	0
away	1
from	0
from	0
that	1

i	0
[laughter-understand]	1

but	1
now	1
that	0
i've	0
broken	0
away	1
from	0
it	0
i'm	0
i'm	0
glad	1
i	0
have	1

well	0
another	1
interesting	0
thing	1
on	0
the	0
our	0
our	1
end	0
here	1
is	0
how	1
e[ven]	0
even	0
in	0
my	0
forties	1
how	0
much	0
younger	1
i	0
dress	1
than	1
my	0
mother	1
would	0
have	0
in	0
her	1
forties	0
and	0
i	1
will	0
uh	0
run	0
around	0
to	0
the	1
store	1
and	0
things	1
in	1
slacks	0
and	0
tennis	1
shoes	0
and	0
she	1

you	0
mean	1
you	0
don't	1
need	0
to	0
wear	0
little	0
old	0
house	1
dresses	0
anymore	0

right	1
and	0
[laughter-pearls]	1
and	0
she	1
would	0
not	0
have	1
even	0
probably	0
owned	1
a	0
pair	1
of	0
tennis	1
shoes	0
after	0
she	0
got	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0

so	1
uh	0
she	1
tells	0
me	0
i	0
dress	1
young	0
but	0
that's	1
okay	0
[laughter-keeps]	1
[laughter-me]	0

that's	1
a	0
good	0
idea	1
that's	1
a	1
good	0
idea	1

well	1
there's	0
not	1
a	0
lot	0
more	1
i	0
can	0
think	1

to	0
discuss	1
on	0
clothing	1

lot	0

uh-huh	1

the	0
news	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock	0
and	0
then	1
um	0
talking	1
with	0
people	0
and	1
just	0
hearing	1
what's	0
going	1
on	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

do	0
you	0
watch	1
do	0
you	0
watch	0
the	1
network	1
like	0
major	1
network	0
news	1
or	0
do	0
you	0
watch	1
like	1
the	0
McNeil	1
Lehrer	1
Hour	1

just	1
the	0
regular	0
channel	1
just	1
channel	0
eight	1

oh	1
really	1

that's	1
our	0
channel	0
here	1
that's	0
the	0
um	0
eyewitness	1
news	0

uh-huh	1

so	1

oh	0
ch[annel]	1
see	1
channel	0
where	1
i	1
am	1
channel	0
eight's	1
um	1
like	0
public	1
TV	1
so	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
different	1

oh	0
uh-huh	1
yeah	1

i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
the	1
uh	1
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
the	1
commentators	1
on	0
like	1
the	1
major	1
networks	1
like	1
right	1
it's	1
kind	1
of	0
appropriate	1
right	0
now	1
because	1
of	1
the	0
election	1
stuff	1
going	0
on	0
but	1
um	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
um	0
they	1
kind	1
of	1
get	1
to	1
throw	1
their	1
opinions	1
into	1
how	1
they	1
you	0
know	1
report	1
on	0
the	1
news	1

right	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
even	1
in	0
the	0
elections	1
they	0
choose	1
who	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
follow	1
and	0
who	1
they're	0
not	1
and	1
basically	1
you	0
know	1
if	1
a	0
c[andidate]	0
candidate	1
can	0
get	1
them	0
to	1
follow	1
then	1
the	0
news	1
will	0
you	1
know	1
kind	0
of	1
publicize	1
his	1
name	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
exactly	1

i	1
don't	1
think	1
that	0
the	0
way	0
i	1
get	0
the	0
news	1
is	0
the	0
right	1
way	0
to	0
get	1
it	0
i	0
think	1
you	0
get	0
a	0
very	1
lopsided	0
picture	1
of	0
what's	1
going	0
on	1

uh-huh	1
uh	1
because	0
they	1
can	1
they	0
can	0
only	1
report	1
on	0
i	0
mean	1
they	0
give	1
each	0
candidate	1
perhaps	1
you	0
know	1
ten	1
second	0
blurbs	1
in	0
which	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
say	1
you	0
you	0
just	1
can't	0
get	0
a	0
full	0
picture	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
their	0
message	1
unless	1
you	0
have	0
time	1
to	0
sit	0
down	0
and	0
r[ead]	0
and	0
probably	0
read	1
something	0
on	0
it	0

right	1

right	1
and	0
the	0
news	1
too	0
it	0
just	1
doesn't	0
um	0
cover	1
a[ll]	0
that	1
many	0
stories	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
just	1
covers	0
your	0
basic	1
you	1
know	0
violent	1
crimes	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
and	0
and	0
your	0
ca[tastrophes]	0
catastrophes	1
with	0
weather	1
and	0
stuff	0
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
other	1
than	0
that	1
you	0
really	1
don't	0
know	0
what's	0
going	0
on	1

yeah	1

um	0
i	1
will	0
read	0
our	0
current	1
letters	1
that	0
come	1
out	0
on	0
elections	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
do	0
read	0
that	1
and	0
i	0
do	1
study	0
who's	1
running	1
in	0
our	0
area	0
and	0
i	0
do	1
study	0
what's	1
going	0
on	0
in	0
the	0
economy	1
it	1
you	0
know	1
and	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
do	1
read	1
other	0
magazines	1
um	0
too	1
to	1
get	1
my	0
information	1

what	0
kind	1
of	1
uh	0
see	1
i	1
subscribe	0
to	1
like	0
Science	1
News	1
and	0
that's	1
that's	1
real	1
good	1
because	1
it	0
gives	1
like	0
a	0
brief	1
summary	1
of	0
all	1
like	1
the	0
updates	1
like	1
of	0
what's	1
going	0
on	0
in	0
science	1
without	1
getting	0
into	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
detail	1
that	0
would	0
you	1
know	0
bog	1
me	0
down	1
that	0
i	0
wouldn't	0
know	1
about	0

right	1

but	0
other	1
than	0
that	1
i	0
don't	0
really	0
r[ead]	0
i	1
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
really	0
subscribe	1

anything	0
else	1

i	0
i	1
used	1
to	1
read	0
every	1
month	0
a	1
Reader's	1
Digest	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
um	0
now	1
i	1
guess	1
i	1
just	1
have	0
friends	1
that	1
clip	0
articles	1
or	1
if	0
i	1
you	1
know	1
am	0
interested	1
in	1
something	0
of	0
course	1
during	0
the	0
w[ar]	0
when	1
we	1
were	0
in	0
war	1
i	0
read	1
up	1
on	1
that	1
just	0
a	0
little	1
in	0
the	0
newspaper	1
to	0
find	1
out	1
what	0
was	0
going	1
on	0
but	0

oh	0
yeah	1

but	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
times	0
i	1
you	1
know	1
i	0
wish	1
i	1
had	1
the	1
time	0
to	1
read	1
all	0
the	0
stories	1
in	0
the	0
newspaper	1
but	1
i	0
just	1
can't	0
seem	1
to	0
find	0
the	0
time	1

yeah	1

if	0
they'd	1
put	1
it	0
out	1
in	0
a	1
video	1
or	0
on	0
not	0
a	0
video	1
but	0
a	0
cassette	1
tape	1
or	0
something	1
where	0
you	1
could	0
just	0
listen	1
to	0
it	0
i	1
would	0
do	0
that	0
while	1
i	0
was	0
doing	0
other	0
things	1

yeah	1

but	0

well	1
i	1
remember	1
dur[ing]	0
back	1
during	1
the	0
uh	1
during	1
the	0
war	1
everyone	1
here	0
at	0
work	1
always	1
had	0
the	0
radio	1
or	0
the	0
TV	1
on	0
because_1	0
that	1
they	1
were	0
going	0
constantly	1
with	0
that	1
stuff	0

right	1

but	0
uh	0

well	1
i	0
um	0
they	1
even	1
did	0
a	1
story	1
on	0
our	0
news	0
here	1
in	1
Texas	1
on	0
what	1
people	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
more	1
of	0
and	1
people	1
said	0
that	0
they	1
wanted	0
to	0
see	1
more	1
on	1
outside	1
of	0
Texas	1
news	1
you	0
know	1
we	1
just	0
don't	0
want	0
to	1
hear	1
every	0
night	1
all	0
the	0
killings	1
that	0
went	1
on	1
here	0
in	0
Dallas	1

yeah	1

that	1
we	1
want	0
to	0
hear	0
what's	1
going	0
on	1
with	0
the	0
economy	1
what's	1
being	0
done	0
to	0
help	1
it	0
what's	1
going	0
on	1
in	0
other	0
countries	1
what's	0
you	0
know	1
just	0
more	1
information	1

if	0
they	1
reported	1
every	0
m[urder]	0
if	1
they	1
reported	1
every	0
violent	1
crime	0
in	0
Atlanta	1
it	1
would	0
take	0
it	1
would	0
probably	1
take	0
the	1
whole	0
news	1
[laughter-hour]	1

[laughter-yeah]	0
well	0

but	0
uh	0

well	0
i	0
guess	1
you'll	0
get	0
pretty	0
good	0
news	1
coverage	0
in	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	1
when	0
you	0
host	1
the	0
uh	0
summer	0
Olympics	1

oh	0
yeah	1
that's	1
they	0
still	1
already	1
they're	0
having	0
like	0
um	0
in	0
the	0
newspaper	1
they	0
have	0
a	0
section	1
i	0
think	1
every	0
now	1
and	0
then	0
o[n]	0
on	0
the	0
Olympics	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
they've	1
got	0
like	0
a	0
countdown	1
it's	0
like	0
sixteen	1
hundred	0
days	1
or	0
something	1

i	1
know	0
we're	1
trying	0
to	0
get	0
tickets	1
to	0
it	0
right	0
now	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

that's	1
gonna	0
be	0
crazy	1
that	0
time	0
of	0
year	1
here	0
but	0

but	0
uh	0

yeah	1

i	0
can't	1
believe	1
i	0
mean	0
they're	0
they're	1
uh	0
stretching	1
out	1
the	0
Olympic	1
news	0
for	0
that	0
much	0
coverage	1
over	0
i	0
guess	1
people	1
want	0
to	1
hear	1
about	0
it	1
also	1
big	1
in	0
big	1
in	0
the	0
news	1
right	0
now	0
is	0
the	0
Braves	1
because	0
they're	1
uh	0
they're	0
in	0
you	1
know	0
tr[aining]	0
spring	0
training	1
or	0
whatever	0
and	0

right	1
right	1

and	0
they	0
did	1
so	0
well	0
last	1
year	0

yeah	1
they	1
spent	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
time	0
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
they	0
spend	0
a	0
long	1
time	0
on	0
sports	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
um	0
that's	1
fine	1
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	0
more	1
time	0
spent	0
on	0
other	1
things	1

yeah	1

but	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
it's	1
they	0
way	1
they	0
do	0
the	1
newscasts	1
uh	0
i	1
wish	1
they	0
they	0
kind	0
of	0
separated	1
it	0
you	1
know	0
or	0
if	0
you	0
wanted	1
to	0
watch	0
one	1
thing	0
you	0
could	0
turn	1
to	0
s[ome]	0
some	0
channel	1
for	0
it	0
but	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
cable	1

okay	1

[ok]ay	1
um	1
so	0
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
um	0
about	1
putting	1
an	1
elderly	1
in	0
a	1
nursing	1
home	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
it	1
varies	1
on	1
on	0
the	1
individual	1
basis	1

hm	0

uh	1
sometimes	1
it	1
is	0
there's	1
no	0
alternative	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
you	0
do	1
not	1
have	1
uh	0
uh	1
family	1
available	1
or	1
family	1
that's	0
uh	0
you	1
may	1
not	1
even	1
have	0
family	1
that	1
is	0
uh	0
in	1
and	1
who	0
around	1

that's	0
true	1
yeah	1

so	1
sometimes	1
it's	0
not	1
an	1
alternative	1

hm	0

and	1
i	1
think	1
uh	1
but	0
i	1
think	1
also	1
sometimes	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
uh	0
a	1
benefit	1
if	1
it's	0
for	0
a	1
short	0
time	1
sometimes	1
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0

um-hum	0

um	0
especially	1
after	0
if	0
it's	1
after	1
an	0
acute	0
illness	1
to	1
get	0
over	1
a	1
uh	0
or	1
to	1
rehab	1
after	1
uh	0
an	0
illness	1

that's	1
true	1
i	0
never	0
thought	1
of	0
that	0
yeah	0

sometimes	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
sometimes	1
the	0
nursing	1
homes	0
are	0
good	1
for	0
uh	0
just	0
short	1
periods	1
of	0
time	1

that's	0
true	1
until	1
they	0
get	0
over	0
that	0
hump	1
of	0
whatever	1
it	0
is	0
they're	0
dealing	1
with	0

um-hum	1

because	1
too	0
often	1
the	1
acute	0
hospitals	1
will	1
are	1
sending	0
them_1	0
out	1
much	0
faster	1
than	0
what	0
they're	0
really	0
able	1
to	0

yes	1

they	1
really	0
are	0
they	1
don't	0
like	0
to	0
keep	1
them	0
longer	1
than	0
a	0
week	0

so	1
so	0
there	0
is	1
some	0
good	1
to	0
it	0

yeah	1

uh	0
sometimes	0
too	1
it's	0
used	1
as	0
a	0
dumb	1
job	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
fam[ilies]	1
well	1
the	0
families	1
do	0
not	0
necessarily	1
uh	0
know	0
what	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
them_1	0
and	0

what	1
do	0
you	0
mean	1

and	0
they	0
don't	1
wanna	0
take	0
the	0
responsibility	1
so	0
they	0
will	0
put	1
them_1	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	0
home	0

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

so	0
you	0
see	1
uh	0
there's	0
both	1
sides	1
to	0
it	0
too	1
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0

yeah	1
and	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
how	1
how	0
sick	1
the	0
person	1
is	0
too	1
and	0
what	0
you're	0
capable	1
of	0
like	0
if	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
family	1
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	0
know	1
of	0
your	0
own	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
um	0
i	1
would	0
personally	0
like	0
it	0
if	0
my	1
parents	0
were	0
to	0
get	0
ill	1
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
them	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
if	0
i	1
had	0
the	0
money	0
with	0
some	0
help	1
that's	1
not	0
always	0
possible	1

that's	0
true	1

but	1
um	0
to	0
the	0
best	1
of	1
my	0
ability	1
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
until	1
it	0
gets	1
impossible	1

i	0
think	1
that's	1
also	1
where	1
you're	1
gonna	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	0
are	1
going	1
to	0
it's	1
there's	0
not	0
a	1
choice	1
it's	1
because_1	1
there	0
it's	0
not	0
economically	0
feasible	1
even	0
to	0
put	1
them_1	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	0
home	0

right	1

um-hum	1

yeah	1

so	0
that	0
that	1
option	1
sometimes	1
is	0
not	1
available	1
if	0
they	1
do	0
not	0
have	1
the	0
uh	1
either	0
Medicare	1
or	0
insurance	1
to	0
cover	1
it	0

that's	0
true	1
yeah	0

so	1

but	0
i	1
think	0
nursing	0
homes	0
can	1
be	0
good	0
just	0
depends	0
on	0
what	0
kind	1
they	0
are	0
you	0
know	1
an	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
check	0
them_1	0
out	0
ahead	1
of	0
time	0

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
there's	1
also	1
some	1
that	0
are	0
set	1
up	1
for	0
specialties	1
uh	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
i	1
know	0
some	0
el[derly]	0
unfortunately	1
some	1
elderly	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	0
or	1
have	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
Alzheimer's	1
or	0
where	0
they	1
wander	1
or	0
or	0
um	0
confused	1
or	1
have	0
some	1
mental	1
problems	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1
that	0
they're	1

and	0
you	0
need	1
a	0
special	0
nursing	1
home	0
for	0
that	1
you	0
need	0
one	1
that	0
has	0
a	0
unit	1
that's	0
locked	1
where	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	0
to	0
get	0
out	1
and	0
roam	0
around	1

yeah	1

and	0
you	0
need	0
people	1
who	0
are	0
trained	1
for	0
that	1
type	1
of	0
problem	1

right	1

an[d]	0
know	1
what	0
they're	0
doing	1
with	0
that	0

yeah	0
so	1
so	0
there's	0
different	1
types	1
of	0
nursing	0
homes	0
i	0
think	1

yeah	1
well	0
my	0
uh	0
grandmother's	1
not	1
really	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
but	0
a	0
retirement	1
home	0
that	0
also	0
has	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
sort	0
of	0
attached	1
to	1
it	0
and	1
she	1
really	0
liked	1
the	0
idea	0
of	0
of	0
moving	1
there	0
she's	1
not	0
ill	1
yet	1

um-hum	0

but	1
um	0
she	1
worked	0
there	0
as	0
a	0
volunteer	1
for	0
about	0
ten	1
years	1
and	0
then	0
she	1
decided	0
that	0
um	0
she's	0
eighty	1
five	0
years	0
old	1
that	0
eventually	1
you	1
know	0
she	0
she	0
doesn't	1
want	0
her	0
family	1
taking	0
care	1
of	0
her	0
and	0
being	0
a	0
burden	1
she's	0
very	0
independent	1
so	0
she's	1
in	0
this	0
nursing	1
home	0
it's	0
out	0
in	0
the	0
country	1
and	1
um	0
she	0
really	1
enjoys	1
it	0
right	0
now	1
because	1
she	0
doesn't	1
have	0
to	0
wash	0
dishes	1
or	0
[laughter-cook]	1

gives	1
her	0
a	1
little	0
bit	0
of	0
her	0
own	0
independence	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
she	1
still	1
has	0
uh	0
a	0
security	1
there	0

right	1
some	1
support	1
and	0
then	0
there's	0
also	1
a	0
sort	0
of	0
a	0
wing	1
for	0
those	1
people	0
that	0
do	1
get	0
sick	0
and	0
what	1
i	1
like	0
about	1
it	1
and	1
i	0
think	0
she	1
likes	0
about	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
she	0
knows	1
everybody	0
there	0
now	1
and	0
then	0
so	1
if	0
she	0
ever	0
does	1
become	0
ill	0
um	0
it'll	1
be	0
like	0
family	1
around	0
her	0

that's	0
right	1
and	0
i	0
i've	0
seen	1
some	0
of	0
them	0
like	0
that	1
too	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
also	1
they	0
have	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
activities	1
going	0
on	1
for	0
the	0
ones	0
who	0
are	0
more	0
active	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1
sh[e]	0

so	0
it's	0
not	1
sort	0
of	0
like	0
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
sick	1
place	0

um-hum	0

no	1
she	0
loves	1
it	0
she	1
had	0
a	0
great	1
social	1
life	0
and	0
she	0
travels	1
and	0
um	0
it's	0
in	0
in	0
Missouri	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
mountains	1
and	0
it's	0
beautiful	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
i	1
hope	1
that	0
i	1
have	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
when	0
i	1
get	0
older	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
of	0
the	0
um	0
i	0
think	1
the	1
the	0
decision	1
that	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
made	1
though	0
on	1
nursing	0
home	0
has	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
joint	1
one	0
between	0
the	0
the	0
uh	0
elderly	1
uh	0
person	1
who's	0
going	0
in	1
and	0
the	1
family	1
that's	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
uh	0
effec[ted]	1
effected	1
by	0
it	0

um-hum	0

oh	0

oh	0
definitely	1
it's	0

and	0
uh	0
you	1
know	0
sometimes	1
it	1
can	0
those	0
choi[ces]	1
those	0
choices	1
can	0
be	0
made	1
in	0
advance	1
and	0
sometimes	1
the	1
choices	1
uh	0
because	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	0
the	0
illness	0
when	0
they're	0

right	1

right	1
okay	1

yes	1

okay	1
how	1
many	1
kids	1
do	1
you	1
have	1

i	0
think	1
w[e]	1
i	1
think	0
we're	1
going	1
to	0
talk	0
about	0
parents	1
spending	0
time	1
with	1
their	1
children	1
we	1
have	0
three	1
children	1
who	0
are	1
eleven	1
nine	1
and	0
eight	1

right	1

so	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
big	0
issue	1
with	1
us	1
although	1
i	1
don't	0
recall	1
marking	1
it	0
on	0
my	0
little	0
things	1
to	0
talk	1
about	0
but	1
perhaps	1
they	0
are	0
looking	1
for	0
uh	0
words	0
to	1
be	0
said	1
like	1
day	1
care	0
and	1
quality	1
time	1
and	1

and	1

uh-huh	0

anyway	1
you	1
don't	0
have	0
children	1

no	1

but	0
you're	1
married	1

two	0
and	0
a	0
half	0
years	0

been	0
trying	1
for	0
about	0
two	1
years	0
but	0
no	0
luck	0
yet	1

oh	0

hopefully	1

you	1
know	1
i	0
know	1
we're	0
not	1
supposed	1
to	0
do	1
this	1
long	1
distance	1
but	1

getting	0

most	0
of	0
the	0
time	1

that's	1
[laughter-exactly]	1
[laughter-what]	0
[laughter-it]	0
[laughter-was]	0
but	0

well	1
i	1
do	1
think	0
with	0
working	0
parents	1
it	0
is	1
i	0
mean	1
there	0
are	1
some	0
real	0
issues	1
here	0
um	0
that	1
i	1
think	1
um	0

uh-huh	0

i	1
don't	1
know	0
it's	0
an	1
interesting	1
phenomena	1
i	0
happen	1
to	0
um	0
i'm	0
a	0
pediatrician	1

oh	0

my	0
husband	1
is	0
a	0
physician	1
so	0
um	0
i	0
i	1
teasingly	1
i	0
talk	0
to	0
parents	0
about	0
this	0
a	0
lot	1
uh	0
children	1
i	0
i	0
think	1
working	1
mothers	0
or	0
mothers	1
who	0
choose	1
to	0
work	0
outside	1
the	0
home	1
um	0
need	0
very	1
early	1
to	0
come	0
to	0
grips	1
with	0
any	0
guilt	1
that	0
they	1
feel	1
and	0
decide	1
what's	0
best	1
for	0
them	1
and	0
their	0
family	1

yeah	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	1
feel	0
when	1
my	0
children	0
were	1
very	1
young	1
i	0
had	0
jobs	1
that	1
helped	1
me	0
be	1
flexible	1
with	0
my	0
schedule	0
and	0
spend	0
time	1
with	0
them	0
and	0
all	1
that	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	0
and	0
i	1
long	1
ago	0
decided	0
i'm	0
a	0
better	0
mother	1
because	0
i	0
work	1
outside	0
the	0
home	1
i	0

um-hum	0

i	0
really	1
believe	1
that	0
and	0
it	0
has	0
um	0
helped	1
us	0
to	0
afford	1
some	0
things	1
for	0
our	0
children	0
that	0
we	0
couldn't	0
otherwise	1
that	0
i	0
think	0
are	0
wonderful	1
particularly	0
at	0
this	0
age	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
our	0
kids	0
are	0
real	1
secure	1
and	1
have	0
a	0
real	1
sense	1
of	0
priorities	1
and	0
that	0
they	0
can	0
do	0
anything	1
and	0
be	0
anything	1
both	0
male	1
and	0
female	0
a	0
lot	0

um-hum	0

so	0
i	0
know	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
rationalization	1
but	1
it's	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
it's	0
true	1
for	0
our	1
family	0
and	0

well	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
has	0
worked	1
very	0
well	0

yeah	0
it's	0
like	0
you	0
said	0
it's	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
each	1
his	0
own	1
i	0
mean	1
we're	0
planning	0
on	0
having	0
my	1
wife	0
stay	0
home	0
and	0
but	0

there's	1
no	0
question	1
i	0
think	0
that's	0
really	1
the	0
best	1
if	0
if	0
a	0
woman	1
is	0
happy	0
doing	0
that	0

um-hum	0

i	0
hate	1
to	0
put	0
it	0
quite	1
that	0
way	1

yeah	0

i	0
was	0
twenty	1
nine	0
when	0
i	0
had	0
my	0
first	1
child	0
and	0
um	0
i	1
would	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
real	1
fulfilled	1
i	0
really	1
would	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
totally	1
staying	0
home	1
with	0
a	0
young	0
child	1
it's	0

um-hum	0

it's	0
a	0
wonderful	1
it's	0
wonderful	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
mother	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
liked	0
i	0
like	0
the	0
way	1
i	0
did	0
it	0

right	1

i	1
sort	0
of	0
worked	0
half	1
time	0
i	0
had	0
very	1
flexible	0
hours	1
i	0
nursed	0
all	1
three	0
of	0
our	0
children	0
till	0
they	0
were	0
at	0
least	1
a	0
year	1
and	0
i	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
that	0
despite	1
working	0
very	1
easily	0
which	0
is	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
i	0
preach	1
all	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
to	0
mothers	1

oh	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
we	0
choose	1
very	1
very	0
carefully	1
the	0
um	0
alternative	0
situations	1
that	0
we	0
had	1
them	0
in	0

um-hum	0

some	0
babysitting	1
groups	0
again	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
rationalization	1
but	0
i	0
really	0
do	1
think	0
sometimes	0
they	0
very	1
early	0
on	0
are	0
around	0
lots	1
of	0
other	0
children	0
and	0
they	0
they	0
learn	1
to	0
share	1
and	0
they	0
learn	1
not	0
necessarily	1
to	0
be	0
the	0
center	0
of	0
attention	1
but	0
that	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	0
we	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
sure	1
they're	0
secure	1

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
that	0
helps	1

well	0
that's	0
good	1
sounds	0
like	0
you're	0
have	0
a	0
handle	1
on	0
it	0

oh	0
yeah	0
hope	0
so	1
so	0
your	0
wife	1
does	0
she	0
work	1
right	0
now	1

um	0
no	1
not	0
right	0
now	1
right	0

she's	0
out	0

right	0
right	0
well	0

just	0

for	0
a	0
couple	1
years	0

you're	0
still	0
trying	1
to	0
dry	0

it's	0
no	0
problem	1
here	1
yeah	0
we	1
really	0
liked	1
it	0
up	0
there	0
but	0

it	1
had	1
a	0
radiator	1
leak	1
once	1
but	0
i	1
never	1
had	0
any	1
major	1
anything	1
other	1
than	0
the	0
compressor	1

right	0

i	1
never	1
really	0
had	0
anything	1
major	1
with	0
my	0
Mazda	1
but	1
it	0
was	1
a	0
standard	1
also	1
and	0
the	0
clutch	1
went	1
out	0
on	1
it	0
toward	1
the	0
end	1
i	0
had	0
it	0
five	1
years	1
and	1
the	0
last	1
year	1
or	0
last	1
two	1
years	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	0
go	0
out	1
really	1
easily	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
went	0
out	0
twice	1
in	0
two	0
years	1
and	0
that's	1
that's	1
a	0
lot	1
it	0
shouldn't	1
go	0
out	1
that	1
much	1

no	1
hm	0

and	1
so	1
i	0
went	1
ahead	1
and	0
bought	0
another	1
standard	1
when	0
i	0
bought	1
the	0
Honda	1
but	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
i'm	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
that	0
again	1
i	0
think	0
i'm	1
going	0
back	0
to	0
automatic	1
now	1

well	1
i	0
never	1
w[ell]	1
well	0
i	0
kind	1
of	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
standard	1
but	1
i've	0
never	1
owned	0
one	1
so	0
i	0
had[n't]	1
i	0
don't	0
drive	1
one	0
a	0
lot	1

right	1

so	1
i	0
don't	1
f[eel]	0
feel	0
comfortable	1
in	0
traffic	1
with	0
it	1

right	1

and	1
for	0
everything	1
i've	0
heard	1
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
easier	0
to	0
sell	1
an	0
automatic	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1

and	1
and	0
resale	1
value	1
is	0
really	1
important	0
to	0
me	1

that's	0
true	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1
me	0
too	1
that's	0
why	1
i	0
got	0
the	0
Honda	1

yeah	0

Hondas	1
have	0
great	1
resale	1
value	0

yeah	0

the	0
Mazda	1
definitely	1
did	0
not	1
not	1
at	0
[laughter-all]	1
they're	1
worse	1
than	0
American	1
cars	0
i	0
think	1
or	0
just	1
as	0
bad	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
resale	1
goes	1

i	0
did	0
pretty	0
well	1
with	0
my	1
uh	0
Regal	1
because	0
it	1
was	0
in	0
really	1
good	0
shape	1
but	0
it	0
still	0
looked	1
real	0
nice	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
interior	1
was	1
still	1
really	0
nice	1
there	0
[what'n/wasn't]	1
cracks	1
all	0
over	0
the	0
dash	1
board	0
and	0
stuff	1
an[d]	1

right	1

and	0
it	0
had	1
some	1
some	1
nice	0
features	1
so	0
i	1
ended	0
up	0
okay	1
with	0
the	0
Buick	1

good	1

and	0
i	0
anticipate	1
the	0
same	0
thing	1
with	0
the	0
Honda	1
whenever	0
i	0
decide	1
to	1
sell	1
it	0
course	1
i	0
may	1
never	1
sell	1
it	0

[laughter-right]	1

i	0
may	1
drive	1
it	1
till	0
it's	0
dead	1
but	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
that's	1
what	0
i	0
did	1
with	1
the	0
Mazda	1
drive	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
till	1
the	0
clutch	1
went	1
out	1
and	0
the	0
wheels	1
fell	0
off	1
[laughter-so]	1

yeah	0

[laughter-so]	1
probably	1
what	1
i'll	0
do	0
again	1

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
really	1
like	1
the	0
Hondas	1
i	1
like	0
foreign	1
cars	1
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

i	0
looked	1
at	0
the	0
Mitsubishi	1
Galant	1
i	1
was	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
four	1
door	0
car	1
having	0
driven	1
the	0
RX	1
seven	0
so	0
long	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
so	1
small	1
and	0
it's	0
really	1
impractical	1
so	0
i	0
wanted	1
something	0
with	0
a	0
real	1
trunk	1
and	0
four	1
doors	1
something	0
easy	1
to	0
get	0
in	0
and	0
out	1
of	0
and	0
i	0
looked	1
at	0
the	0
Galant	1
and	0
those	1
were	0
really	1
nice	1
and	0
you	1
can	1
get	1
them_1	1
for	0
a	0
great	1
price	1

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
found	1
it	1
hard	1
to	0
deal	1
with	1
the	1
dealership	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
through	1

oh	1

so	1
that's	1
how	1
i	1
ended	1
up	0
with	1
a	1
Honda	1

i	0
wasn't	1
even	0
looking	1
for	0
a	0
car	1
when	0
i	1
bought	1
this	0
car	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
thinking	1
about	0
buying	1
a	0
Prelude	1
from	0
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	0
moving	1
to	0
New	0
York	1
or	0
something	1
so	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
gonna	1
sell	0
her	0
car	1
because_1	0
she	0
didn't	0
need	1
it	0
anymore	1
and	0
it	1
was	1
only	1
like	1
a	0
year	1
old	1
and	0
i	1
had	0
never	0
driven	1
uh	0
a	0
Prelude	1
so	1
i	0
went	1
to	0
a	0
dealership	1
because	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
uh	0
the	0
same	1
year	1
and	1
same	1
model	1
of	1
Prelude	1
on	0
their	0
used	1
car	1
lot	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
test	1
drove	1
it	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
just	0
fell	1
in	0
love	1
with	1
this	0
brand	1
new	1
white	1
Prelude	1
you	0
know	1
two	1
liter	0
SI	1
with	0
the	1
the	0
sun	1
roof	1
and	0
the	0
moon	1
roof	1
and	1

oh	1
yeah	0

they're	0
nice	1
i	0
think	1

and	1
i	1
i	0
bought	1
it	0
loaded	1

oh	1
yeah	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
loaded	1
i	1

i	1
mean	1

i	1
i	0
love	1
all	0
those	1
little	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
[laughter-don't]	0
need	1
but	0
they're	1
so	0
wonderful	1

yeah	0
i	1
went	1
there	1
looking	0
at	1
a	1
used	1
car	1
and	0
two	0
days	1
later	1
i	0
bought	1
this	0
car	1
i	1

i	0
felt	1
i	0
felt	1
like	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
worst	1
impulse	1
that	1
w[as]	0
that	1
was	0
the	0
largest	1
impulse	0
buy	1
i	0
had	1
ever	0
made	1
the	1

the	1
oth[er]	0
the	0
two	1
other	0
things	1
that	0
i've	0
bought	1
on	0
impulse	1
are	0
VCR	1
and	0
a	0
[laughter-washer]	1
and	0
dryer	1

i	0
would	0
[laughter-say]	1

i	0
go	1
for	0
the	0
big	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
i	0
noticed	1
mine	1
was	0
definitely	1
not	0
impulse	1
i	0
really	1
needed	0
a	0
new	0
car	1
mine	1
was	0
just	1
it's	0
getting	1
worn	1
out	0
i	0
guess	1
from	0
being	1
a	0
sports	0
car	1
i	0
drove	1
it	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	1
got	0
it	0
right	1
after	0
high	0
school	1
so	0
by	0
the	0
time	1
i	0
traded	1
it	0
in	1
it	1
was	0
[laughter-ready]	1

yeah	1
i	0
got	1
i	0
got	1
my	1
Buick	1
as	0
a	0
high	1
school	1
graduation	0
gift	1

ready	1
to	0
[laughter-go]	1

did	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
this	0
[what'n/wasn't]	1
really	1
an	0
impulse	1
i	0
mean	0
buying	1
it	0
right	1
then	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
right	1
quickly	1
was	0
kind	1
of	0
impulsive	1
but	1
i'd	1
been	0
thinking	1
about	0
buying	1
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
three	1
years	1
and	1
i	0
was	1
just	1
scared	1
to	0

right	1

i	1
was	0
scared	1
to	0
start	0
taking	1
on	0
payments	1
because	0
the	0
Buick	1
was	0
long	1
since	0
paid	1
for	0

right	1
that's	0
same	1
with	0
me	1
would	0
you	1
ever	0
buy	1
a	0
used	0
car	1
for	1
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
yourself	1

buy	0
a	1
buy	1
buy	1
a	0
used	0
car	1

like	1

right	1

sure	1

i	1
i	0
was	1
going	0
to	0
buy	1
one	0
once	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
worry	1
about	1
who's	0
driven	1
them_1	0
and	0
what	0
they've	1
been	0
through	1
and	0
the	0
warranties	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
just	1

yeah	0

just	1
i	0
can't	1
seem	0
to	0
get	1
over	0
that	1
that	0
just	1
bothers	0
[laughter-me]	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
why	1

well	1
um	0
like	1
on	0
Hondas	1
they	1
supposedly	1
the	0
maintenance	1
records	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
registered	1
with	0
Honda	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
you	1
can	0
request	1
whatever	0
maintenance	1
records	1
exist	1
on	0
cars	1
and	1
you	0
can	0
have	1
them_1	0
checked	1
out	0
by	0
mechanics	1
and	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

mean	1
they	0
can't	1
stop	1
you	0
from	1
doing	1
it	1
so	1

hoping	1
that	0
they	0
do	1
go	0
to	0
a	0
Honda	1
dealership	1
to	0
get	0
them_1	0
serviced	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

well	1
and	0
even	1
if	0
they	0
didn't	1
you	0
can	0
still	1
get	0
a	0
good	1
idea	1
from	1
a	1
if	0
you	1
can	0
get	1
a	0
good	1
mechanic	1
to	0
check	1
it	0
over	1
real	0
carefully	1
and	0
check	1
the	1
blocks	1
and	0
everything	1

yeah	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

well	1
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
all	1

okay	1
well	0
i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	1
to	0
you	1

i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	0
to	0
you	1

bye-bye	1

bye-bye	1

okay	1
so	1
i	1
guess	1
it	1
starts	1
recording	1
now	1

okay	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
really	1
know	0
that	1
much	1
about	1
the	1
recycling	1
in	0
this	1
area	1
that	0
we're	1
in	1
we	1
live	0
in	1
the	0
Saginaw	1
area	1

Saginaw	1

um-hum	0
and	1
i'm	0
not	1
real	1
familiar	1
with	1
uh	0
anything	1
that	0
i	1
i[n]	1
fact	1
the	1
far	0
as	1
i	1
know	0
the	0
school	1
doesn't	0
have	0
any	0
kind	0
of	0
programs	1
or	0
anything	0
out	1
here	1
and	0
uh	0
or	1
the	0
grocery	1
story	1
or	0
[laughter-anything]	1
in	0
this	1
area	1

really	1

yeah	1

the	0
rec[ycling]	0
we	1
live	1
in	1
Plano	1
and	1
they	0
started	0
off	1
recycling	0
by	0
um	1
putting	1
the	0
i	0
think	0
at	1
each	0
Wal-Mart	1
they	0
had	1
some	0
recycling	1
dumpsters	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
which	0
i[t]	0
now	1
i	0
guess	1
the	0
uh	0
city	1
h[as]	0
has	0
bought	1
these	0
big	1
green	1
trash	1
cans	1
and	1
uh	1
we	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
recycling	1
truck	1
that	0
comes	1
around	0
now	1
and	1
you	0
separate	1
your	1
glass	1
and	1
paper	1
and	0
uh	0
aluminum	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
you	0
set	1
it	0
out	1
and	0
they	0
pick	1
it	0
up	1
and	0
i[t]	0
it	1
works	1
real	0
neat	1
they	0
seem	1
to	0
be	0
having	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
response	1

really	1

but	0

that	1
is	1
pretty	0
good	0
i'm	1
we're	1
originally	1
from	0
another	1
state	1
and	0
i	0
know	1
in	0
the	0
state	0
we	0
were	0
from	1
that	0
they	0
did	1
that	0
ty[pe]	0
similar	1
type	0
thing	0
the	0
city	1
brought	0
out	1
you	0
know	1
se[parate]	1
tra[sh]	0
separate	1
trash	1
cans	0
and	0
you	0
separated	1
your	1
stuff	1
and	0
you	0
put	0
it	0
in	1
there	0
and	0
they	0
took	1
it	0
you	1
know	0

did	0
they	1
did	0
they	1
like	1
on	0
bottles	1
did	0
they	1
give	0
you	0
a	0
so	1
many	0
cents	1
back	1
for	0
for	0
cans	1
even	0

i	1
don't	0
really	0
know	1

even	0
i've	0
seen	1

i	1
don't	0
really	0
know	1
they	0
they	1
started	0
after	1
we	0
moved	0
down	0
here	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
i'm	1
not	0
really	0
familiar	1
i	0

seen	1
that	0

i	0
just	0
know	1
that	1
and	0
my	0
in-laws	1
up	0
in	1
up	0
in	0
Oklahoma	1
that's	0
how	0
they	1
do	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
pick	1
it	0
up	0
but	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
they	1
get	0
a	0
get	0
anything	0
back	1
on	0
it	0
or	0
do	0
you	1
get	0
money	1
for	0
it	0

no	1
i've	0
just	0
i	1
noticed	1
in	0
Iowa	1
and	0
other	0
cities	0
like	0
that	1
it's	0
a	0
nickel	1
per	1
aluminum	0
can	1

oh	1

so	0
you	0
don't	1
see	1
too	1
many	0
thrown	1
out	1
around	0
the	1
[laughter-streets]	1
even	0
bottles	1

[laughter-really]	1

you	1
know	0
all	0
kinds	1
of	1
bottles	1
they	1
they	1
they	0
really	0
charge	1
people	1
to	0
uh	1
i	0
guess	0
when	0
you	0
purchase	1
them_1	0
and	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you	0
turn	1
them_1	0
back	0
in	1

right	1

i	0
know	0
i	0
remember	1
the	0
old	1
days	1
as	0
a	0
kid	1
where	0
a	1
bottle	1
was	0
a	1
nickel	1
an[d]	0

right	1
and	0
now	1
now	1
most	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
th[e]	0
throwaway	1

right	1

so	1
maybe	1
that's	0
one	1
thing	0
they	1
could	0
do	1

i	1
think	0
now	1
they're	0
a	1
lot	0
more	0
expensive	1
than	0
that	1
um	0
i	1
bought	1
some	0
Cokes	1
the	0
other	1
day	1
in	0
the	1
br[ead]	1
the	1
little	0
bottles	1
you	1
know	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
the	0
bottles	1
were	0
like	0
i	1
know	0
they	1
were	0
at	1
least	1
ten	1
cents	0
apiece	1
i	1
was	1
trying	1
to	0
figure	1
out	1
how	0
i	0
was	1
like	0
God	1
how	1
much	0
were	0
those	1
[laughter-bottles]	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

well	0
that's	1

and	0
it	1
was	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
like	0
uh	0
eight	0
an[d]	0
and	0
eight	1
and	0
ten	1
packs	0
you	0
know	1
instead	0
of	0
six	1
packs	0

right	1

and	0
uh	0
and	0
they	1
were	0
like	0
it	0
was	1
like	0
two	1
dollars	0
and	0
something	0
for	0
the	0
bottles	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-was]	0
[laughter-like]	0
[laughter-God]	1
[laughter-Almighty]	1
costs	1
more	0
for	0
the	0
bottles	1
than	0
it	0
did	0
for	0
the	0
Cokes	1

that	1
was	0
my	0
brother's	1
first	0
job	1
in	0
a	1
grocery	1
store	1
he	1
was	1
in	0
the	0
bottle	1

than	0
it's	1
worth	1

it's	1
i	1
don't	0

don't	1
remember	1
it	0

it	0
seemed	1
like	0
it	0
did	1
but	0
it	0
might	1
not	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
guess	1
we	1
can	0
start	1
um	0

okay	1

okay	1

no	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
have	0
any	0
kids	1
i	0
um	0
my	0
sister	1

a	0
she	0
just	1
had	0
a	0
baby	1
he's	0
about	0
five	1
months	0
old	1
and	0
she	0
was	1
worrying	1
about	1
going	1
back	0
to	1
work	1
and	0
what	1
she	0
was	0
gonna	0
do	1
with	0
him	0
and	0
the	0
different	1

um-hum	0

do	0
you	1
have	0
kids	1

i	1
have	0
three	1

oh	0
really	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
i	0
do	1
yes	1
um	1
i	1
don't	0
work	1
though	1
but	1
i	0
used	1
to	0
work	1
and	1
when	0
i	0
had	0
two	1
children	0

um-hum	0

i	1
work	0
off	1
and	0
on	0
just	0
temporarily	1
and	0
usually	1
find	0
friends	1
to	0
babysit	1
but	1
i	1
don't	1
envy	0
anybody	1
who's	0
in	1
[laughter-that]	0
situation	1
to	0
find	1
day	0
care	1

yeah	1

but	1
does	0
your	0
sister	0
live	0
in	0
a	0
big	1
community	1

um	1
yeah	1
she	0
lives	1
it's	1
a	1
it's	0
a	1
fairly	1
large	1
community	1
she	1
um	0
got	0
real	1
lucky	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
a	0
boss	1
who	1
um	1
moved	1
into	1
a	0
larger	0
office	1

um-hum	1

and	0
she's	1
able	1
to	1
take	0
her	1
baby	0
to	1
work	0
with	1
her	0

oh	1
really	1

and	0
it's	1
a	0
small	1
office	1
that	0
she	0
works	1
in	0

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
it's	0
a	0
it's	1
a	0
legal	1
firm	1
office	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
one	1
lawyer	1

um	0

and	0
so	0
she's	1
the	0
only	1
one	1
really	1
that	0
takes	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
office	1
there's	0
no	1
one	0
else	0
that	0
works	1
there	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	1
they	1
have	0
an	0
extra	0
room	1
and	1
everything	1
for	0
the	1
baby	1
so	0
it	0
works	1
out	0
pretty	0
good	1
for	0
her	1

wow	1

how	0
lucky	1
i	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
around	0
here	1
sometimes	0
have	1
like	0
mothers	1
or	0
grandmothers	1
that	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
their	0
kids	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
but	0
the	0
community	1
i'm	1
in	0
is	0
not	0
a	0
real	0
large	1
one	1
so	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	0
babysit	1
in	0
their	0
home	1
that	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
either	0
know	1
them	0
or	0
know	0
somebody	1
who	0
knows	1
them	0
to	0
get	1
to	0

yeah	1
so	0
it's	0
fairly	1
safe	1

yeah	1
to	0
get	0
references	1
and	0
that	1
so	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
i	0
do[n't]	0
don't	1
feel	0
comfortable	1
about	0
leaving	1
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
big	0
day	1
care	0
center	1
but	0
simply	1
because_1	0
there's	0
so	1
many	0
kids	1
and	1
so	1
many	0

worried	1
that	1
they're	0
not	1
going	1
to	0
get	1
enough	0
attention	1

yeah	1
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
colds	1
and	0
things	1
[laughter-like]	0
[laughter-that]	1
get	1
spread	1
real	0
easy	1
and	1
things	1

yeah	1

but	0
and	0
they're	1
expensive	1
and	0
course	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
different	0
types	1
of	0
day	1
care	1
available	1
too	1
you	1
know	1
where	0
they	0
teach	1
them	1
academic	1
things	0

yes	1

or	1
they	0
just	1
watch	1
them	1
and	0
let	1
them_1	0
play	1
and	0
things	1
like	1
that	1
but	0
take	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
to	1
find	1
the	0
right	0
place	1

yeah	1
and	0
you	0
and	0
you	0
don't	1
always	0
even	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
it's	0
gonna	1
be	0
the	1
right	1
place	1
or	0
not	1

um-hum	0

anything	1
i	0
guess	1
could	0
happen	1

um-hum	0

because	0
after	1
i	1
guess	1
after	1
he	0
you	1
know	1
gets	1
to	0
a	0
certain	1
age	1
she's	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
to	0
take	0
him	1
to	0
a	0
day	1
care	0

um-hum	1
when	0
he	0
starts	0
toddling	1
around	1
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

when	0
when	0
he's	0
not	1
when	0
she	0
can't	1
keep	0
control	1
of	0
him	0
and	1
he	1
starts	1
crawling	1
that's	0

um-hum	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
hard	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
kind	0
of	0
stressful	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
nice	1
to	0
have	0
him	0
around	1

um-hum	1

but	1
um	0
seems	1
like	0
you	1
know	0
go[lly]	1
what	0
if	0
he	0
cried	1
at	0
the	0
wrong	1
time	0
or	0
the	0
phone	1
rang	0
or	0
you	1
know	0
at	0
the	0
wrong	1
time	1

yeah	1

but	0

i	0
think	1
she	0
has	0
problems	1
with	0
that	0
too	1

um-hum	0
well	1
when	0
you	1
have	0
kids	1
will	0
you	1
work	1
do	0
you	0
work	1
now	1

i	1
don't	0
know	0
that's	0

that's	0
something	1
i've	0
considered	1
um	0

um-hum	0

i	1
always	0
kind	0
of	0
think	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
neat	1
to	0
be	1
able	0
to	0
watch	1
them_1	0
and	0
be	1
there	0
for	0
them_1	0
all	1
the	0
time	1

um-hum	0

is	0
that	1
what	0
you	0
do	1

um	0
yeah	1
uh	0
actually	1
i	0
teach	1
my	0
kids	1
at	0
home	1
so	0
i'm	1
here	0
all	1
the	0
time	0

oh	1
so	0
they	1
don't	0
go	0
to	0
school	1
is	0
it	0
like	0
um	0
oh	1
what's	1
that	1
called	1
it's	0
a	1
correspondence	1
school	1
they	0
do	0
it	0
at	0
home	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

that's	1
interesting	1

so	1

do	0
you	1
have	1
to	0
have	1
any	0
special	0
training	1

not	1
it	0
depends	1
on	0
the	0
state	1
you	0
live	0
actually	1
some	0
laws	1
absolutely	1
prohibit	1
it	0
some	1
states	1
um	0
say	0
that	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
certified	1
teacher	1
in	0
order	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
our	1
state	0
doesn't	1
yet	1
say	1
that	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
a	0
certified	1
teacher	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
college	1
but	0
i	0
you	1
know	0
but	0
my	0
kids	1
are	0
only	0
elementary	1
grades	0
levels	1
right	0
now	1
and	1
so	1

so	0
they	1
haven't	0
been	0
to	0
public	1
schools	0
at	0
all	1

one	1
of	0
them_1	0
was	0
for	0
a	0
couple	1
of	0
years	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
know	0
my	0
oldest	1
he	1
was	0
and	0
then	0
my	0
youngest	0
two	1
have	0
never	0
been	1

hm	0

so	1
anyway	1
but	0
we	1
don't	0

so	1
you've	0
never	0
had	0

okay	1
well	1
um	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
care	1
center	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
worked	1
in	1
um	0
in	1
all	1
the	0
different	0
areas	1
of	0
the	0
day	1
care	0
center	1
and	0
it	1
is	0
they	1
can	0
be	1
deceiving	1
to	0
people	1
i	1
did	1
not	0
work	1
there	1
long	1
because	1
i	1
couldn't	1
handle	1
the	1
the	1
treatment	1
that	0
the	0
children	1
got	0
and	0
this	1
is	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
very	1
well-known	0
center	1
here	0
in	0
Tyler	1
who	0
had	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
um	0
centers	1
all	0
over	1
you	1
know	1
the	0
um	0
city	1
and	1

um-hum	0

and	1
they	1
would	0
um	0
be	0
one	1
way	1
when	0
the	0
parents	1
were	0
there	1
and	0
be	0
another	1
way	1
when	0
the	0
parents	0
left	1

yeah	1

so	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
you	0
need	1
to	0
make	1
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
do	1
do	0
day	1
care	0
centers	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
should	0
make	0
frequent	1
checks	1
and	1
um	0
to	1
check	0
in	1
on	0
them_1	0
when	0
they're	1
[laughter-not]	0
[laughter-expecting]	1
it	0

because	0
they	0
do	1
do	0
things	0
differently	1
when	0
you're	1
not	0
around	1
so	1

well	0
that	0
i	0
know	0
wh[at]	1
the	1
things	1
that	0
we	1
kind	1
of	0
looked	0
at	1
is	0
is	0
you	0
wanna	1
see	1
how	1
many	0
teachers	1
you	1
have	1
and	0
and	0
how	1
many	0
kids	1
they	0
have	0
and	0
how	1
they	0
break	0
it	1
up	0

um-hum	0

right	1

because	1
we	1
had	1
we	1
had	1
one	0
that	1
sounds	0
kind	1
of	0
like	0
what	0
you	1
were	0
in	1

um-hum	1

it	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
really	1
good	1
one	1
and	0
in	0
fact	1
it	0
worked	1
out	1
for	0
us	1
because_1	0
my	0
wife	1
we	0
kind	0
of	0
bartered	1
my	0
wife	1
did	1
artwork	1
for	1
them_1	0
and	1
then	1
you	1
know	1
so	0
we	1
got	1
our	1
uh	0
day	1
care	0
free	1

um-hum	0

but	1
they	1
didn't	0
have	0
enough	0
teachers	1
and	1

well	0
this	1
one	0
was	1
set	0
up	1
good	1
i	1
mean	1
they	1
had	1
two	1
teachers	1
to	1
every	1
room	1
um	1
sometimes	1
three	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
they	1
had	1
a	0
good	1
system	1
like	0
so	1
when	1
you	1
walked	1
in	1
everything	1
looks	0
cool	1

um-hum	0

the	1
problem	0
i	1
had	0
was	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
affection	1
to	0
the	1
children	1
enough	1
they	1
did	0
not	1
show	1
them	1
care	1
to	0
these	1
small	1
children	1
who	0
are	0
being	0
left	1

um-hum	0

um	0
they	1
one	1
time	0
i	1
picked	0
up	1
this	1
little	1
boy	1
who	0
was	1
crying	1
and	0
the	1
owner	1
came	1
and	0
just	0
chewed	1
me	1
up	0
one	1
side	1
and	1
down	0
the	1
other	0
you	0
know	1
he	0

hm	0

he	0
said	0
you	1
are	0
gonna	0
have	0
every	1
child	0
in	0
here	0
wanting	0
you	0
to	0
pick	0
them_1	0
up	1

and	0
i	1
said	0
no	1
this	0
child	0
was	0
crying	1
and	0
needed	0
some	0
comfort	1
you	0
know	1
what	1

yeah	1

what	1
is	0
your	1
problem	0
so	1
um	0

did	0
did	0
they	0
separate	1
them_1	0
by	0
age	1
group	1

yes	1

because_1	0
i'd	1
think	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
that's	1
one	0
thing	0
that	0
was	0
important	1

right	1
they	0
did	1
they	0
had	1
like	0
um	0
the	0
the	0
crawlers	1
the	0
babies	1
that	0
didn't	1
walk	0
in	0
one	1
room	0
the	0
ones	1
that	0
were	0
starting	1
to	0
walk	0
in	0
one	0
room	1

uh-huh	0

then	0
they	0
had	1
like	1
the	0
um	0
three	1
three	0
year	0
olds	1
upper	1
fours	1
lower	1
fours	1
upper	0
fives	1
lower	0
fives	1
you	1
know	1
just	1
like	1
that	1

yeah	1

you	1
know	0
they	0
really	1
did	0
separate	1
them_1	0
well	0

it	0
it	0
sound	1
yeah	1

it	1
was	0
just	1
the	0
teachers	1
themselves	1

it	0
sounds	1
like	0
to	0
me	1
your	1
your	1
concern	1
would	0
be	0
to	0
make	0
sure	1
that	0
they	0
are	0
loving	1
people	0
affectionate	1
people	0
that	0
they're	1
they're	0
kind	1
of	0
par[ents]	0
maybe	0
parents	1
themselves	1
or	0
something	1

right	1

but	0
yeah	1
that	0
they're	1
not	0

yeah	1
their	0
system	1

right	1
but	0
their	1
but	0
their	0
system	1
was	0
was	0
great	1
but	0
um	0
the	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
caring	1
just	0
wasn't	0
there	1

um-hum	0

the	0
one	1
woman	1
that	0
taught	1
that	0
did	1
the	0
babies	1
i	0
worked	1
with	1
her	1
and	0
she	1
was	0
fabulous	1

um-hum	0

she	0
loved	1
them	0
babies	1
and	0
she	0
loved	1
them_1	0
and	0
cared	1
for	0
them_1	0
but	0
um	0
every	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
others	1
that	0
i	0
saw	1
was	0
just	0
screaming	1
and	0
yelling	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
would	0
make	1
me	1
a	0
nervous	0
wreck	1
[laughter-so]	0
you	1
know	0

yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
think	0
that's	0
probably	0
a	0
really	1
important	0
thing	1
because	0
you	1
can	0
have	0
doctorates	1
and	0
PhD's	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
know	1
all	0
the	0
technical	1
stuff	0
but	0
if	0
they	0
don't	0
reach	0
out	1
and	0
touch	0
the	0
kids	1
then	0
that	1
doesn't	0
do	0
any	0
good	1

yeah	0
these	0
kids	1
are	0
just	0
in	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0
all	0
day	1
and	1
uh	0
with	0
no	1
any	0
type	0
of	0
emotional	1
you	0
know	1
getting	0
love	1
getting	0
care	1
they're	0

yeah	1

they're	0
just	0
there	1
you	0
know	1
going	1
through	0
this	0
routine	1
which	0
is	0
lousy	1

yeah	1

an[d]	0

the	0
other	1
the	0
other	1
group	0
that	0
we	1
had	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
interesting	1
the	0
other	1
one	0
we	1
went	0
to	0
the	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
husband	1
and	0
wife	1
team	0

um-hum	0

and	0
we	1
knew	0
them	0
from	0
other	0
associations	1
but	0
uh	0
it	0
was	0
kind	1
of	0
interesting	1
because	0
she	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
the	0
strict	1
one	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
you	1
know	0
she	1
would	0
she'd	1
put	0
her	0
arm	1
around	0
the	0
kids	0
and	0
talk	1
to	0
them_1	0
and	0
stuff	1
you	0
know	1
but	0
he	1
was	0
actually	0
the	1
more	1
um	0
the	0
more	1
uh	0
what	0
demonstrative	1
type	1
the	0
more	1
loving	1
he	0

um-hum	0

he	0
would	0
you	1
know	0
laugh	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
play	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	1
and	1
it	0
it	0
it	0
was	0
kind	0
of	0
interesting	1
to	0
see	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
actually	1
the	0
man	1
in	0
the	0
group	1
that	0
that	0
did	1
that	0
side	1
of	0
it	0

uh-huh	1

an[d]	0

yeah	0
you	0
don't	1
see	1
that	0
much	1

yeah	1
so	0
they	1
had	0
a	1
really	1
nice	1
balance	1
we	1
liked	1
that	0
one	1
in	0
fact	1
it	0
was	1
called	0
Humpty	1
Dumpty	1
Play	1
School	0
or	0
something	1
but	0

that's	0
cute	1

but	0
they	0
also	1
did	1
they	0
also	1
did	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
teaching	1
things	1
and	0
then	0
they	0
had	1
um	0
you	0
know	1
obedience	1
obedience	1
was	0
important	1

yeah	0
that	0
has	1
to	0
be	1
with	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0

and	1
you	1
know	0
so	0
they	1
u[sed]	0
you	0
know	1
they	0
used	1
uh	0
oh	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
used	1
the	0
you	0
probably	0
heard	1
where	0
you	1
know	1
where	0
you	0
stand	1
in	0
front	1
of	1
the	0
clock	1
and	0
get	1
your	0
power	1
back	1
to	0
control	1
yourself	1

that's	1
that's	1
a	0
new	1
one	0

it's	0
it's	0
it's	0
one	1

uh	0
i	1
can't	0
remember	1
what	1
they	0
call	0
it	0
exactly	1
but	0
y[ou]	0
you	0
just	0
stand	1
them_1	0
in	1
front	0
of	1
the	0
clock	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
has	0
a	1
second	1
hand	1
that	0

i	0
know	1
they've	1
changed	1
it	1
a	0
lot	1
and	1
upgraded	1
everything	1
but	1
we	1
used	0
to	1
have	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
fun	1
there	1

well	1
you	0
know	0
we	0
went	1
there	1
once	1

a	0
week	1
there	0
on	0
a	0
a	0

i	0
hope	1
it's	0
swimming	1
season	0
[laughter-because]	0
[laughter-it]	0
[laughter-wasn't]	1
a	0
tremendous	1
thing	0
not	0
amount	1
of	0
things	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
do	0
there	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
if	0
you	0
don't	1
like	1
the	0
night	1
life	0
and	1
the	0
antique	1
shopping	1
there	0
isn't	1
much	1
there	1
but	1
that	1
can	0
be	1
fun	1

it	0
well	1
an[d]	1
and	0
that's	1
probably	1
we	0
do	1
like	1
the	0
night	1
life	0
to	1
an	1
extent	1
and	1
they	0
do	1
have	1
a	1
Mardi	1
Gras	1
night	0
planned	1

um-hum	0

and	1
i'm	0
kind	1
of	0
anxious	1
for	0
that	1
but	0
um	1
yours	1
to	0
Disneyworld	1
sounds	1
a	0
little	1
bit	0
better	1

did	0
you	1
know	1
that	1
next	0
week	1
there's	1
several	1
TV	1
shows	0
coming	1
from	1
there	1
in	1
celebration	1
of	1
their	1
anniversary	1

no	1
i	0
know	1
this	0
is	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
time	1
to	0
go	1
because	0
they	0
are	1
having	0
so	0
many	0
activities	1
and	0
special	1
shows	1

well	1
and	0
with	0
a	1
daughter	1
nine	1
it	1
is	0
just	1
she's	0
old	1
enough	1
to	0
really	1
grasp	1
the	0
meaning	1
behind	1

yes	1

be	0
excited	1
about	0
all	0
of	0
it	0

uh	0
i[f]	1
so	0
uh	0
well	1
if	1
you're	1
working	1
then	0
you're	1
probably	1
on	1
a	0
limited	1
amount	1
of	0
time	1
per	0
year	1
that	1
you	0
can	1
go	0

well	1
not	0
really	1
uh	0
we're	1
doing	0
the	0
same	0
thing	1
tying	1
it	0
in	0
with	0
my	0
husband's	0
business	1
trip	1
and	0
i	1
just	0
save	0
vacation	1
for	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
and	1
uh	0
just	0
travel	1
whenever	1
we	0
can	1

oh	1
that's	0

well	1
i	1
really	0
i	0
think	1
travel	1
when	0
i	0
heard	0
my	0
topic	1
today	0
i	1
thought	0
okay	1
that's	1
my	0
favo[rite]	0
[laughter-that's]	0
[laughter-my]	0
[laughter-favorite]	0
becau[se]	0

how	1
easy	1

becau[se]	0

right	1

and	0
really	1
at	0
our	0
point	0
of	0
life	1
our	0
children	1
are	1
grown	1
and	1
um	0
it	0
has	1
just	1
worked	0
out	0
really	1
well	1
with	0
this	0
um	0
position	1
he's	0
in	1
because	1
i	1
can	0
go	0
at	0
a	0
spur	1
of	0
the	0
moment	1
or	1
what	0
have	1
you	0
and	0

um-hum	1

and	0
it	0
depends	1
where	0
he's	0
going	1
whether	1
or	0
not	0
i	1
decide	0
to	0
go	0
along	1
but	0

sure	1

but	0
i	0
do	1
do	1
like	0
to	0
travel	1
and	0
it's	0
um	0
i	1
don't	1
mind	0
the	0
pool	1
life	1
at	0
all	1
during	0
the	0
day	1

um-hum	1

and	1
i	0
like	0
to	0
sightseeing	1
and	0
i	0
love	1
to	0
shop	1

um-hum	1

[laughter-so]	0
[laughter-it's]	0

so	0
that's	1
perfect	1
what	0
more	1
could	1
you	0
ask	1
for	0

that's	1
right	1
but	0
if	0
thi[s]	0

and	0
then	0
get	0
to	0
pick	1
and	1
choose	1
the	0
places	1

well	1
and	0
one	1
of	0
my	0
very	1
favorite	0
is	0
Las	1
Vegas	0

ah	0

um	0
that	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
to	0
say	0
we	0
both	1
end	1
up	0
going	0
to	0
Las	0
Vegas	1
um	0
probably	1
once	1
every	1
maybe	1
year	0
and	0
a	0
half	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
presently	1
we	0
have	1
quite	1
a	0
few	0
frequent	1
flyer	0
miles	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	0
i've	1
just	0
requested	1
that	0
they	0
send	1
us	0
two	1
of	0
our	0
coach	1
tickets	1
because	1
we	0
have	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
flying	0
with	0
Continental	1

um-hum	1

and	1
they're	0
recommending	1
that	0
you	0
use	1
those	0
because	0
they	0
don't	1
know	0
the	0
future	1
of	0
Continental	0

right	1
it's	0
kind	0
of	1
shaky	1

and	0
i	1
said	0
well	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
have	0
all	1
the	0
miles	1
we	1
better	1
[laughter-start]	1
[laughter-using]	1
[laughter-them]	0

that's	0
true	1
it	0

uh	0
so	0

it	0
really	1
is	1

so	0
we	1
are	0
thinking	1
that	0
we	0
might	0
go	1
to	1
Las	0
Vegas	1
during	0
the	0
winter	1
this	0
year	0
sometime	1
for	0
just	1
kind	1
of	0
a	0
quick	0
trip	1
um	0
when	0
we	0
normally	1
go	1
that	0
way	0
we	0
like	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
California	1
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	1
because	1
we	0
really	1
don't	1
get	0
out	1
there	0
as	0
often	1
as	0
you	1
could	0
probably	1
from	0
Texas	1

um-hum	0
our	1

our	1
last	1
big	0
trip	0
we	0
drove	1
through	0
New	0
Mexico	1
and	0
Colorado	1
and	0
went	0
to	0
the	0
Grand	0
Canyon	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
back	1
through	0
Silverton	1
and	0
Durango	1
and	0
oh	1
it	0
was	0
fun	1
it	0
was	0
so	1
relaxing	1
and	0
a	0
really	1
neat	1
part	0
of	0
the	1
country	1
and	1
the	0
kids	1
were	0
old	1
enough	0
to	0
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
our	0

i	1
think	0
that's	1
a	0
good	1
trip	0

um-hum	0

and	1
really	1
for	0
the	0
children	1
to	0
learn	1
as	1
well	1
for	0
a	0
family	1
vacation	1
that	1
would	0
be	0
excellent	1

right	1

now	1
we	0
did	1
what	1
we	0
sometimes	1
do	0
since	0
we	0
are	1
in	0
Ohio	1
and	0
it	0
takes	1
a	0
while	1
just	0
to	0
even	1
get	1
to	0
the	0
what	0
i	1
would	0
call	0
the	0
more	0
picturesque	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1
we	1
will	0
fly	1
to	0
something	1
like	0
once	1
we	0
flew	0
to	0
Colorado	1
to	0
Denver	1
and	0
then	0
we	0
rented	1
a	0
car	1
for	0
two	1
weeks	0
and	0
we	0
went	0
through	1
the	0
northern	1
route	1
and	0
through	0
Utah	1
and	1
as	0
far	0
west	1
as	0
Las	0
Vegas	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
then	0
we	0
returned	1
through	1
uh	0
New	0
Mexico	1
that	0
you	0
just	0
mentioned	1

um-hum	0

and	1
it	0
was	0
oh	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
great	1

oh	1
there's	0
s[o]	0
too	1
much	0
to	0
see	0
really	1

oh	0
i	0
i	1
think	0
that's	0
that's	1
the	0
way	1
to	0

do	1
you	1
know	1
anyone	1
that	1
uh	1
has	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
or	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
one	1

no	1
but	1
i	1
my	1
grandparents	1
were	1
looking	1
into	1
it	1
before	1
so	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
they've	1
said	1

uh-huh	1

um-hum	1

well	1
i'm	1
trying	1
to	0
think	1
my	1
uh	0
uh	0
wife's	1
grandmother	1
had	0
Alzheimer's	1
and	1
they	0
were	0
going	0
to	0
put	1
her	0
into	1
a	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	1
and	1
uh	0
they	1
when	1
they	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
she	1
had	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
the	1
nursing	1
home	1
made	0
them	1
come	0
and	0
take	1
her	0
back	1
because	0
she	1
was	1
being	1
a	0
a	1
you	1
know	0
a	0
a	1
nuisance	1
or	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
nuisance	1
i	0
mean	1
sh[e]	0
she	0
sort	1
of	0
went	0
you	1
know	0
bananas	1
and	1

oh	1
they	0
thought	1
it	1
was	0
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	0
bother	1

and	1
they	0
couldn't	1
couldn't	1
deal	1
with	0
her	0
so	1
i	0
guess	1
you	0
need	1
to	1
uh	0
know	1
whether	1
it's	0
a	0
you	1
know	1
no	1
deposit	1
no	0
return	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
whether	0

right	1
if	1
they're	1
equipped	1
too	1
to	0
handle	1
the	0
kind	1
of	1
patients	1
you're	1
gonna	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
put	0
in	0
there	1
too	1

yeah	1

because	1
i	1
know	1
my	1
grandparents	1
wanted	1
to	0
have	1
some	1
independence	1
still	1

right	1

they	1
wanted	1
someplace	1
they	1
can	1
go	1
and	1
have	1
their	1
meals	1
and	1
a	0
nurse	1
on	0
staff	1
just	1
in	1
case	1
they	0
needed	1
her	0
but	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
independent	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
their	0
own	1
room	1

right	1

my	0
grandmother	1
actually	0
was	0
in	0
a	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
that	0
um	1
there	1
was	1
a	0
retirement	1
hotel	1
and	0
then	0
a	1
uh	1
there	0
was	0
some	1
sort	1
of	0
full-time	1
care	1
place	1
that	0
was	0
also	1
associated	1
with	0
it	1
so	0
for	1
um	0
the	1
first	1
few	1
years	1
she	0
had	1
her	1
own	1
apartment	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
made	1
her	0
own	0
meals	1
sometimes	1
but	1
could	0
could	0
also	1
go	1
and	0
eat	1
someplace	1
else	1

um-hum	0

and	0
then	1
um	0
as	1
she	0
became	1
less	1
able	0
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
herself	0
then	1
she	0
moved	1
into	0
this	0
other	1
part	1
that	0
was	1
able	1
to	1
um	1
provide	1
full-time	1
care	1
and	1
um	0
she	1
didn't	1
have	1
to	1
do	0
anything	1
anymore	1
but	1
my	1
experience	0
has	1
been	0
that	0
most	1
people	1
that	0
move	0
into	1
nursing	1
homes	0
die	1
very	1
quickly	1
and	0
that's	1
some	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
whether	0
that's	1
because	1
they	1
you	0
know	0
sort	1
of	0
give	0
up	0
hope	1
once	0
they	0
get	1
in	1
there	0
or	0
what	1
the	0
what	1
the	0
reason	1
is	0
but	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
average	1
length	0
of	0
time	1
that	0
somebody	0
lives	1
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
is	0
only	0
like	0
six	0
months	1
or	0
something	0

well	1
a	1
lot	0
of	1
that's	1
probably	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
the	1
fact	0
that	0
people	1
go	1
to	1
it	0
because	0
they	1
need	1
help	1

yeah	1

they	1
need	1
health	0
care	1
so	0
they're	1
already	1
ill	1
before	0
they	0
go	1

right	1

that's	1
probably	1
a	1
large	0
factor	1

yeah	1
if	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
take	1
care	1
of	0
yourself	0
at	0
all	1
or	0
have	1
someone	0
that	0
can	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	0
then	0
you	0
stay	1
where	0
you	0
are	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
only	0
go	1
there	0
as	0
a	0
last	0
resort	1

um-hum	1

or	0
people	0
send	1
you	0
there	0
as	1
a	0
last	0
resort	1

right	1
right	1
that's	0
my	0
grandparents	1
it	0
was	0
just	0
so	0
that	1
the	0
rest	1
of	0
the	1
relatives	1
would	1
have	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
knowing	1
that	1
if	0
anything	1
happened	1
there	0
was	1
somebody	0
there	1
for	1
them	0

uh-huh	1

so	0
that	1
was	0
their	1
thinking	0
somebody	1
who	0
would	1
know	1
what	0
to	0
do	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	0
an	0
emergency	1

right	0

and	0
also	1
so	0
they	0
could	0
find	1
someplace	1
they	0
enjoyed	1
while	0
they	0
still	1
had	1
choices	1
to	0
make	1
so	0
they	0
wouldn't	1
be	0
stuck	1
going	0
into	0
just	0
whatever	1
nursing	1
home	0
was	0
available	1
at	1
the	1
time	1

right	0

i	0
guess	0
that's	1
a	0
problem	0
too	1
for	1
people	0
wait	1
lists	1
and	0
all	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	1

that	1
um	1
you	1
can't	1
always	1
get	1
in	1
when	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
and	1
of	0
course	1
you	0
can't	1
just	0
sit	1
around	0
and	1
wait	1

right	1
when	0
you	0
need	1
it	0
you	0
need	1
it	0
i	1
guess	1

yeah	1

and	0
the	0
money	1
is	0
also	1
another	0
issue	1
how	1
you're	0
gonna	0
pay	1
for	1
it	0

right	1

at	1
that	1
stage	0
of	0
life	1
you	0
only	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
money	0
left	1
and	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
not	0
exactly	1
fair	1
for	0
the	0
younger	1
family	1
members	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
put	0
in	0
their	1
savings	0

yeah	1

i	0
mean	0
it	0
is	1
kind	0
of	0
fair	1
but	0
it's	0
also	0
not	1
fair	0
because	0
they	0
have	1
their	0
own	1
children	1
to	1
raise	1

sure	1

so	0
that's	1
another	0
problem	1

and	0
you	0
probably	1
if	1
it	1
were	0
you	1
you	1
probably	1
wouldn't	1
want	1
someone	0
choosing	1
a	0
place	1
for	0
you	0
to	0
live	1
based	1
on	0
lowest	0
price	1

right	1
right	1
so	1
it's	1
it's	1
just	0
so	1
complicated	0
anymore	1
i	0
think	0
people	1
outlive	1
their	0
savings	1
and	0
with	0
medicine	1
being	1
the	0
way	0
it	0
is	0
you're	0
extending	1
life	1
where	0
sometimes	1
the	0
quality	1
of	0
living	1
has	0
gone	1
down	1
and	0
they're	0
not	1
necessarily	1
enjoying	1
life	0
anymore	1

yeah	1
well	1
maybe	0
that's	1
the	0
purpose	1
of	0
the	0
nursing	1
home	0
is	0
to	0
have	0
them	0
go	1
someplace	1
where	0
they	0
can	0
see	1
that	0
it's	0
not	1
worth	0
continuing	1

it's	1
just	0
a	0
shame	1
that's	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
has	0
to	0
be	1
i	0
think	1
the	0
retirement	1
home	0
idea's	0
a	0
nice	1
idea	0
to	0
go	1
and	0
find	1
older	1
people	1
and	0
with	0
similar	1
interests	1
and	0
someplace	1
to	0
stay	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
because_1	1
uh	0
like	0
if	0
your	0
spouse	1
died	1
all	0
of	1
a	0
sudden	1
you	1
be	0
all	0
alone	1
it'd	0
be	0
nice	1
to	0
go	0
someplace	0
people	1
similar	0
to	0
you	1
and	0
have	1
friends	1

right	1

i	0
i've	0
known	1
quite	0
a	0
few	1
people	0
that	0
have	0
um	0
gone	1
to	0
retirement	1
communities	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
they	0
have	1
them	0
back	1
there	0
but	0
here	1
in	0
California	1
and	0
in	0
Ariz[ona]	0

okay	1
uh	1
so	1
your	1
you	1
you	1
i	1
guess	1
uh	1
you're	1
probably	1
in	1
the	0
same	1
uh	1
same	1
situation	1
uh	1
we're	1
in	1
we're	1
kind	0
of	1
past	1
having	1
to	0
provide	1
child	1
care	1
our	1
our	0
kids	1
are	1
grown	0
up	1
we	1
don't	1
have	0
any	1
grandchildren	1
yet	0
but	0
uh	1
uh	0
they're	1

twenty	0
six	1
and	1
the	0
other	0

uh	0
twenty	1
twenty	1
one	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
they're	1
uh	0
um	1
they're	1
they're	1
getting	1
there	0
you	1

well	1
they're	1
gonna	1
be	1
getting	1
there	0

you	1
know	1
there	0
no	1
no	1
no	1
prospects	1
right	1
away	1
for	1
anything	1
to	1
happen	1
but	1

yeah	1

uh	0
uh-huh	1
oh	1
i	1
see	1

but	1
uh	1

i	0
have	1
uh	0
five	1
children	0

her	1
bring	1
her	1
her	1
little	0
daughter	1
in	0

the	1
they're	1
kind	0
of	1
but	1
she	1

time	1

um-hum	0

then	0

get	0
to	0

a	0
provider	1
but	0

know	0
there's	0
only	0
so	1
much	0
one	0
person	0
can	0
do	1

yeah	1

she	1
says	1

so	1
awful	1

be	0
some	1
good	1
ones	1
around	1

but	0
it's	0
really	1

really	1
really	0
very	0
difficult	0
and	1

of	1
a	0
government	1
seeded	1
type	0
job	1
and	0

her	0
own	1
and	0
everything	1
but	0
i	1
quit	0
my	0

because	0
i	0
couldn't	0
stand	1
how	0
she	0
was	0
taking	0
care	1
of	0
my	0
child	1

a	0
hundred	1
and	0
four	0
fever	0
they	0
couldn't	1

anything	0
because	0
they're	1
not	0
allowed	1
to	0
at	0
school	0
and	0
everything	0

right	1

i	0
was	0
so	1
furious	1
i	0
i	0
quit	1
that	0
job	0
and	0
i	0
stayed	0
home	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
longer	0
then	1
i	0
went	0
and	0
got	1
a	0
um	0
a	0
job	1
in	0
real	1
estate	0
where	0
i	0
can	0
kind	0
of	0
adjust	1
my	0
time	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
better	1

yeah	0
a	0
li[ttle]	0
little	1
bit	0
more	0
flexibility	1
you	0
can	0
come	1
and	0
go	1

yeah	1
but	0
uh	0
i	1
haven't	0
had	0
any	0
good	0
really	0
very	1
good	0
experience	0
with	0
child	1
care	0

yeah	1
well	1
when	0
our	1

you	0
put	0

or	0

or	1
you	0
put	1
the	0
chicken	1
in	0
then	0
pour	1
the	0
uh	0
broth	1
over	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
put	0
mushrooms	1
in	0
if	0
you	0
want	1
and	0
then	0
just	0

over	1
the	1
uncooked	1
rice	0

uncooked	1
rice	1

it	1
just	1

oh	0

it	1
with	0
where	1
you	1
put	0
you	0
cook	1
the	0
ri[ce]	1
well	0
i	0
guess	1
you	0
probably	1
could	1
do	0
it	1
some	0
way	1
but	1
cook	1
the	0
rice	1
and	0
then	0
take	1
a	0
can	1
of	0
like	1
cream	1
of	0
mushroom	1
soup	0
or	1
cream	1
of	0
chicken	1
soup	0
and	0
pu[t]	1
a	0
bit	0
of	0
white	0
wine	1
in	1
it	1

uh-huh	0
ooh	0
yeah	0

and	0
every	1
once	0
in	0
a	1
while	0
i'll	0
put	1
in	1
white	0
i'll	0
slice	0
white	1
grapes	0
and	1
i'll	0
put	1
it	0
in	1
there	0
and	0
that's	1
because_1	0
i'm	1
not	0
a	0
real	0
big	0
wine	1
person	0
but	0
i	0
like	1
it	0
it	0
it	0
adds	1
something	0
to	0
the	0
chicken	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

and	1
then	1
just	1
bake	1
it	0
and	0
it	1
makes	0
a	1
wonderful	1
sauce	1
over	1
the	0
rice	1

well	1
i'll	0
keep	1
that	1
one	1
in	0
mind	0
too	1

[laughter-yeah]	0

yeah	0

[laughter-it's]	0
[laughter-it]	0
that	1
was	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
first	1
things	0
i	0
made	1
for	0
my	0
husband	1
because_1	0
it's	0
like	0
hm	0
yeah	1

yeah	0

i	1
could	0
actually	0
find	1
something	0
i	0
could	0
cook	1
real	1
easy	1
that	0
would	0
be	1
kind	0
of	0
sort	1
of	0
elegant	1
kind	1
of	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
you	1
can	0
get	0
away	1
with	0
it	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
in	0
having	0
a	0
semi	1
nice	1
dinner	1
or	0

oh	0
yeah	0

or	0
you	1
know	0
semi	1
formal	0
but	0

but	0
then	1
i	0
di[dn't]	0
i	0
hadn't	0
thought	1
about	0
doing	0
it	0
with	0
uncooked	1
rice	0

yeah	0

so	0
just	0
like	0
in	0
a	0
thirteen	1
by	0
nine	0
pan	1

yeah	1
you	0
put	1
in	0
um	1
let's	1

hm	0

let's	1
see	0
what	0
was	1
it	0
three	1
quarters	0
of	0
cup	1
of	0
rice	1
or	0

hm	0

it	0
depends	1
on	0
you	0
can	0
really	0
vary	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

but	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
put	0
the	0
water	1
in	0
proportionally	1
i	0
can't	1
remember	1
i	0
think	1
it	1
was	0
three	1
quarters	0
cup	1
rice	1
to	0
two	1
cups	0
water	1
two	1
cups	1
um	0
broth	0

yeah	1
yeah	1
it's	0
i	1
i	1
use	1
that	0
for	0
brea[kfast]	0
for	1
rice	1
and	0
for	1
when	0
i	0
cook	1
pasta	1
or	0
something	0
i'll	0
i'll	1
put	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
bouillon	1
in	0
there	1
just	0
to	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
little	0
extra	1
flavor	0

yeah	1
that's	1
flavor	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0

hm	1
now	0
that	1
would	0
be	1
good	1

uh-huh	0

how	1
long	0
do	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
bake	1
it	1

um	0
let's	0
see	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
was	1
an	0
hour	1
i've	0
done	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
microwave	1
so	0
often	1
lately	1
because	0
it's	0
it's	0
really	1
easy	1

i	1
do	0
i	1
do	0
microwave	1
too	0
a	0
[laughter-lot]	1

yeah	0
but	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
about	1
an	0
hour	1

how	1
long	0
would	0
it	0
be	1
in	0
the	0
m[icrowave]	0
how	1
long	0
would	0
it	0
be	0
in	0
the	0
microwave	1

or	0
maybe	1
it's	0
only	1
half	1
hour	0

um	0
you	0
just	0
until	1
the	0
rice	1
looks	0
fluffy	1
and	0
and	0
not	0
overdone	1
you	0
know	1
before	1
it	0
gets	0
overdone	1

oh	0
okay	0

okay_1	0

do	0
you	0
just	0
brown	1
the	0
chicken	0
to	0
get	0
it	0
colored	1

yeah	1

or	0
do	0
you	0
go	1
ahead	0
and	0
let	0
it	0
cook	0
through	1

um	0
i'd	1
let	1
it	1
cook	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
just	0
so	0
that	1
the	0
cooking	1
goes	0
a	0
little	0
faster	1

okay	0

hm	1
oh	0
this	1
is	0
a	1
beneficial	1
call	0
i	1
like	1
this	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
well	0
i	1
liked	0
it	0
your	1
idea	1
too	1
there	0

yeah	0
but	0
that	1
one's	1
an	0
easy	1
one	0
it's	0
like	0
just	0
put	1
in	0
a	0
friend	0
of	1
mine	0
makes	1
it	0
where	0
she	0
goes	1
ahead	0
and	0
seasons	1
up	0
the	0
with	0
the	0
soup	1
and	0
the	0
wine	1

uh-huh	1

put	0
in	0
garlic	1
and	0
onion	1
powder	0
or	1
chopped	0
onions	1
if	0
you	0
wanna	0
do	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
wh[atever]	0
whatever	1
you	0
however	1
much	0
effort	1
you	0
feel	0
like	0
putting	1
into	0
it	0

yeah	0

uh-huh	0

but	1
it	0
it	0
makes	1
a	0
great	1
i	0
mean	0
m[y]	0
i've	1
got	0
a	0
two	1
year	0
old	0
and	0
a	0
four	1
year	0
old	0
and	0
they	1
love	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
be[cause]	0
because	0
my	0
daughter	1
calls	0
it	0
her	1
gravy	1
and	0
i	0
mean	0
she	1
thinks	0
it's	0
wonderful	1
i'm	0

i'm	0
like	0
good	1
you're	0
a	0
picky	0
eater	1
if	0
i	1
can	0
get	0
you	1
to	0
ea[t]	0

hello	1
Ann	1

hello	1
Chuck	1

um	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
i	1
attended	1
a	1
conference	1
here	1
at	0
Utah	1
State	1
University	1
on	1
recycling	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
interested	1
to	0
hear	1
because_1	0
they	0
had	1
some	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
EPA	1
and	0
lots	1
of	0
different	1
places	1

um-hum	1

and	0
uh	0
they	1
had	0
basically	1
decided	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
going	0
to	1
be	0
a	0
real	1
problem	1
here	1
within	1
a	0
few	0
years	1
on	0
solid	1
waste	1

um	0
i	1
didn't	1
think	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
revelation	1

well	1
it's	0
not	1
too	1
new	0

right	1
so	0
what	1
what	1
i[s]	1
is	1
the	0
EPA	1
recommending	1
now	1

oh	0
they	0
really	1
didn't	0
propose	1
any	0
solutions	1
actually	1
they	0
were	0
the	1
guy	1
was	1
pretty	1
negative	1
about	0
the	1
things	1
that	0
the	0
government	1
was	0
doing	0
even	1
though	0
he	0
was	0
from	0
the	0
EPA	1

um-hum	0

but	0
he	1
had	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
facts	1
to	0
to	0
give	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
how	1
many	0
solid	1
waste	0
plants	1
were	0
being	0
shut	0
down	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
uh	0
one	0
of	1
the	0
most	0
interesting	1
things	0
that	0
he	1
was	0
talking	1
about	0
was	0
recycling	1
of	0
of	0
news	1
print	0
and	0
he	0
was	0
talking	1
about	0
um	0
the	1
City	1
of	1
New	0
York	1
and	0
how	1
they	0
went	1
and	1
collected	1
all	1
this	0
news	1
print	1

yeah	0

and	1
they	0
could	1
sell	1
it	0
for	1
a	1
while	1
they	0
were	1
able	1
to	1
sell	1
it	0
for	0
some	1
amount	0
per	1
ton	1
and	0
now	1
at	0
this	1
stage	0
of	0
the	0
game	0
where	0
they	0
have	0
gotten	1
into	0
recycling	1
they've	0
collected	0
so	1
much	0
news	1
print	0
that	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
to	0
have	0
it	0
hauled	0
away	1

why	1
that's	1
a	0
that's	0
a	0
common	1
problem	0
now	1
that	0
seems	1
that	1
has	0
happened	1
in	0
Dallas	1
as	0
well	1
as	0
New	0
York	1
and	1
i	0
try	1
to	0
recycle	1
all	1
of	0
the	0
newspapers	0
that	0
come	0
to	0
my	1
house	0
and	0
after	1
a	0
while	1
i	0
just	1
quit	0
taking	0
the	0
newspaper	1
because	1
i	0
couldn't	1
recycle	1
it	0
anymore	0
which	0
isn't	1
good	1
for	0
business	1
on	0
the	0
other	1
end	1
either	0
i	1
suppose	1

yeah	0
we're	1
doing	0
some	0
here	1
in	0
in	0
Cash	1
Valley	1
the	0
community	1
here	1

um-hum	0

there's	1
uh	0
we've	1
actually	1
got	0
a	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
nice	1
set	0
up	0
we've	1
got	1
a	0
couple	0
of	1
plants	1
here	0
that	0
actually	1
take	0
uh	0
recycled	0
paper	1
and	1
shred	1
it	0
and	1
spray	1
it	0
with	0
chemical	0
treatment	1
so	0
that	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
fire	1
hazard	1
and	0
make	0
it	0
into	0
insulation	1

right	1

and	0
they	1
can	0
actually	0
use	1
as	0
much	1
recycled	1
paper	0
as	0
the	0
community	1
can	0
get	1
to	0
them_1	0
because	0
they're	0
actually	0
buying	1
it	0
and	0
shipping	1
it	0
in	0
from	0
outside	1

well	0
that's	1
good	1

so	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
real	0
keys	1
it	0
sounds	1
like	0
to	0
getting	0
recycling	1
for	0
uh	0
paper	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1
to	0
go	1
is	1
to	0
get	1
some	0
sort	0
of	0
business	1
to	0
actually	0
want	1
it	0
once	0
you've	0
collected	1
it	0

right	1
there	0
has	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
a	0
reuse	1
for	0
it	0
i	1
mean	0
that's	0
why	1
they	1
recycle	1
the	0
one	0
i	1
think	0
is	0
the	0
most	0
interesting	1
is	0
with	0
the	0
recycled	1
bottles	1
and	0
all	1
that	0
uh	0
the	0
industry	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
doing	1
with	0
the	0
recycled	1
polymers	1
uh	1
everything	1
from	0
uh	0
waste	1
baskets	1
to	0
carpet	1
to	0
the	0
no	1
stick	0
i	0
mean	0
the	0
sticky	1
slide	1
rugs	0
under	1
the	0
carpet	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
i	1
think	0
they're	0
even	0
putting	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
roadways	1
these	1
days	1
and	0
they're	1
making	0
clothes	1
now	0
that	1
are	1
recycled	1
like	1
the	0
recycled	1
plastic	0
Coke	1
bottles	0
and	0
and	0
milk	1
cartons	0
and	0
things	0
like	1
that	1

and	1
there's	1
a	0
paper	0
presented	1
at	0
this	0
conference	1
from	0
a	0
guy	1
from	0
Alabama	1
and	0
he	1
was	1
kind	0
of	0
hired	1
to	1
do	1
a	0
study	1
by	0
two	1
departments	1
for	0
the	1
government	1
one	1
was	0
like	0
environmental	1
protection	1
and	0
the	1
other	1
one	0
was	0
oh	0
i	1
can't	1
remember	0
what	0
but	1
the	0
basic	1
idea	1
it	1
was	0
presented	1
to	0
him	1
was	0
how	1
can	0
we	1
maximize	1
the	1
amount	0
of	1
energy	1
that	1
we	0
can	0
get	1
back	1
from	0
recycling	1
and	1
minimize	1
the	0
volume	1
of	1
stuff	1
we	0
are	0
putting	1
into	1
our	1
landfill	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
the	0
solution	1
that	1
he	1
came	0
up	0
with	0
for	0
plastics	1
and	0
it	0
was	1
really	1
quite	1
amazing	1
because_1	1
he	0
says	0
well	1
the	0
best	1
thing	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
plastics	1
is	0
to	0
burn	1
them_1	0

oh	1
really	1

he	0
came	1
to	1
the	0
conclusion	1
plastics	1
is	1
actually	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
biggest	1
problems	1
in	0
landfills	1
cause	1
it's	0
it's	0
low	1
weight	1
but	1
it's	0
high	1
volume	1
so	0
it	0
takes	1
up	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
space	1

right	1

and	1
there's	0
almost	1
no	1
energy	1
there's	0
very	1
little	0
energy	1
value	0
in	0
actually	1
doing	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
recycling	1
but	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
energy	0
in	0
it	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
burn	1
it	0
and	0
use	0
it	0
to	0
produce	1
electricity	1

huh	0

so	1
his	1
solution	0
was	0
to	0
burn	1
plastic	1
collect	1
it	0
and	0
burn	1
it	0

well	1
it's	0
carbon	1
so	0
that	1
makes	0
sense	1
like	0
a	1
carbon	1
fuel	1
of	1
some	1
sort	0
but	1
what	1
what	0
about	1
emissions	1

yeah	1

and	0
it's	0
more	1
than	0
even	0
paper	1
or	0
something	1
like	0
that	0
there's	0
more	1
energy	0
in	0
it	0
per	0
pound	1
or	0
whatever	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
he	0
didn't	1
deal	1
with	0
that	1

oh	1

he	0
just	1
said	0
burn	1
it	0

[laughter-okay]	0

he	0
didn't	0
talk	1
about	0
cleaning	1
it	0
up	1
or	0
anything	0
like	0
that	1
so	0
it's	0
not	1
very	0
practical	1
is	0
it	0

no	1
well	0
that's	1
interesting	1
i	0
bet	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
good	0
day	1
at	0
the	0
uh	0
conference	1
then	1

yeah	1
well	0
real	1
interest[ing]	0

did	0
it	1
change	1
anything	0
for	0
you	1

um	0
not	1
too	0
much	1
i'm	1
uh	0
i	1
got	0
a	1
bit	1
actuall[y]	0

okay	1
um	1
well	0
the	1
first	1
thing	1
uh	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
offer	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
uh	0
information	1
about	1
selecting	1
a	1
school	1

well	1
first	1
i	1
think	1
they've	1
got	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
pretty	1
good	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
do	1

uh-huh	1

uh	1
once	1
they	1
have	0
that	1
then	1
they	1
can	1
start	1
looking	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
publications	1
that	0
give	1
out	1
all	0
the	0
information	1
about	0
schools	1
and	1
write	0
to	1
the	0
schools	0
themselves	1
and	0
start	1
finding	0
out	1
about	1
the	1
different	0
requirements	1
for	1
the	0
programs	1
and	1
what	0
kind	1
of	1
uh	0
of	1
job	1
assistance	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
other	0
kind	0
of	1
stuff	1
they	0
offer	1

yeah	0
uh	1
do	0
you	1
do	0
you	1
feel	0
that	1
the	0
first	1
two	0
years	1
that	1
the	1
um	1
depending	1
upon	1
the	1
field	1
i	1
know	0
there	1
are	1
some	1
fields	0
which	1
a	1
person	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
school	1
that	1
school	1
all	1
four	1
years	1
but	1
i	0
know	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
fields	1
where	1
it's	1
really	1
not	1
necessary	1

yeah	0
a	0
lot	1
fields	1
are	1
most	1
of	1
your	1
liberal	1
arts	1
degrees	1
and	0
stuff	1
aren't	1
really	1
concerned	1
with	0
your	1
first	0
two	1
years	0
anyway	1
it's	1
it's	0
your	0
core	1
education	1
your	0
general	1
requi[rements]	1
general	1
education	1
requirements	1

uh-huh	1

um	0
if	1
you	1
know	1
if	1
they	0
want	1
to	0
get	1
a	1
liberal	1
arts	1
degree	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	1
advice	1
i'd	0
give	0
them	1
go	0
to	0
the	0
school	1
you'd	0
like	0
to	1
go	1
to	0

yeah	1

that's	0
what	0
i	1
did	0

yeah	1

i	0
didn't	1
care	1
about	0
the	0
program	1
or	1
anything	0
else	1
i	0
went	1
where	0
i	0
wanted	1
to	0
go	1

yeah	0
what	1
was	1
your	1
degree	1
in	0

uh	0
political	0
science	1

political	0
science	0

kn[ow]	0
i	0
know	0
i'm	1
going	0
to	1
school	1
right	0

a	1
friend	1

UTD	1
University	0
of	0

north	1
Carolina	0

i	0

that's	0
where	0
Texas	1
Instruments	1
is	0

yeah	0
right	0

um	0
something	0
that	0
i	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
i've	1
noticed	1
that	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
friend	1
i	0
think	1
if	1
you're	0
going	1
into	0
like	0
uh	1
law	1
or	1
medicine	1
a	0
very	1
particular	1
very	1
specific	1
field	1
even	1
even	1
engineering	1
you	1
can	0
get	1
you	1
can	0
meet	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
the	0
requirements	1
at	0
a	0
public	1
um	1
institution	1

sure	0

and	0
uh	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	0
cheaper	0

oh	1
yeah	0

my	1
parents	1
my	1
parents	0
made	0
a	0
mistake	1
in	1
uh	0
in	0
sending	1
my	0
sister	1
to	1
a	0
private	1
institution	1
for	0
the	0
first	1
two	0
years	1

um	1

and	0
she	1
found	0
out	1
after	1
that	0
she	0
said	1
you	0
know	0
my	0
parents	1
they	1
just	0
they	0
really	1
wasted	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
money	0
this	1
is	0
about	0
twenty	1
years	0
ago	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
uh	0
well	0
right	0
now	0
i	0
just	0
i	0
mean	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
selecting	1
selecting	1
a	0
school	1
i	1
i	0
i	0
feel	1
that	0
uh	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
depends	0
upon	0
the	0
major	1

yeah	0
it	0
does	0
Um	0
i	1
didn't	0
know	0
what	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
do	1
after	1
i	0
got	0
my	0
my	0
degree	1

uh-huh	0

um	0
originally	1
i	0
had	0
planned	1
uh	0
undergrad	1
degree	1
in	0
political	1
science	1
and	1
then	0
a	0
master's	0
in	0
public	0
administration	1
And	0
i	0
went	1
ahead	0
and	0
pursued	1
that	1
i	1
i	1
got	0
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	0
thesis	1
and	0
decided	1
To	1
hell	1
with	0
it	1
i	1
didn't	1
want	1
it	0
Um	0
and	0
from	0
that	0
point	1
i	0
went	0
to	0
law	1
school	0

um-hum	0

and	0
after	0
a	1
year	1
and	0
a	0
half	1
of	0
that	1
i	0
decided	1
i	0
didn't	0
want	0
that	0
either	1

okay	0

haven't	0
figured	0
out	0
what	1
i	0
want	0
to	0
be	1
when	0
i	0
grow	1
up	0

yeah	0

and	1
so	1
but	0
i	1
i	1
i	0
really	1
did	0
enjoy	0
the	1
law	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	1
that's	1
where	0
i	0
wanted	1
to	1
be	0
but	0
i	1
didn't	1
want	0
to	1
go	0
through	0
the	1
uh	0
the	0
hassle	1
that	0
the	0
law	1
schools	0
put	1
you	0
through	1
because	1
i	0
never	1
did	1
want	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
practicing	1
attorney	1
i	0
just	1
wanted	1
a	1
law	1
degree	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
i've	0
since	1
discovered	1
that	0
i	0
would	1
be	0
far	1
better	0
off	0
being	1
in	0
the	1
paralegal	1
field	1
because	1
that's	1
the	0
nuts	1
and	1
bolts	0
of	0
the	1
law	1
and	0
that's	0
what	0
i	0
like	1

yeah	0

and	1
you	1
don't	1
have	0
to	0
put	1
up	0
with	1
all	0
the	0
B	1
S	1
that	0
the	1
lawyers	1
have	1
to	1

right	0

so	1
that's	1
that's	1
what	1
i'm	0
pursuing	1
right	0
now	0

um	0

and	1
i'm	1
pretty	0
happy	1
with	0
it	0
so	1
far	1

yeah	0
yeah	0
i'm	0
i'm	0
pursuing	0
what	0
they	0
what's	0
what's	0
called	0
an	0
interdisciplinary	0
field	0
i'm	1
a	0
speech	1
therapy	1
major	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
fortunately	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
good	0
medical	1
background	1

yeah	0
that's	1

and	0

that's	1
probably	0
very	0
useful	1

yeah	0
it's	1
it's	0
actually	1
turning	0
out	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
more	1
useful	0
than	0
what	0
i	0
thought	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
also	1
have	1
a	0
good	1
languages	1
background	0
linguistics	1
and	1
some	1
psychology	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
it's	1
all	1
working	0
together	1

yeah	0

the	0
only	1
field	0
i'm	0
not	0
familiar	1
with	0
really	1
is	0
education	1
which	0
is	0
required	1
as	0
well	1
it	0
requires	0
about	0
four	1
or	0
five	0
different	0
fields	1
really	1

oh	0
good	0
grief	0

so	0
it's	0
a	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
i	1
thought	1
at	0
one	1
time	0
i	0
wanted	0
to	1
be	0
a	0
teacher	1
but	0
i	1
i	1
quickly	1
dispelled	1
that	1
idea	0
when	1
i	0
became	1
a	0
substitute	1
teacher	1
for	0
a	1
while	1
just	1
to	1
get	1
my	0
feet	1
wet	1

uh-huh	0

i	1
said	1
uh	1
i	1
couldn't	1
do	0
this	1
everyday	1

no	0
way	0

um	0

maybe	0
maybe	0
being	0
a	0
tenured	0
professor	0
would	0
be	0
one	0
thing	0
but	1
being	0
a	1
public	1
school	1
teacher	0
is	1
entirely	0
another	1
thing	0

oh	1
so	0
you	1
are	1
a	0
disgruntled	1
graduate	1
student	1

i	1
am	0
a	1
dis[gruntled]	1
i	1
am	1
i	1
am	1
just	0
a	0
disgruntled	1
person	1
all	1
around	1

oh	1

i'm	1
the	0
uh	0
i'm	1
the	0
uh	0
original	1
uh	0
mister	0
Scrooge	1
i	0
guess	0

yeah	0
bah	0
humbug	0

yeah	0
bah	0
humbug	0
Yeah	1
i	0
just	0

i	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
yeah	0
there	1
is	0
i	1
i	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
law	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
fine	1
field	0
a	0
fine	1
profession	1
fine	1
field	0
to	0
go	0
into	1
um	0
i	1
know	1
one	0
time	0
i	1
was	0
in	1
a	0
political	1
science	1
class	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
talking	1
about	0
fields	1
people	1
going	0
into	0
different	0
fields	1
i	1
made	0
an	0
off	1
off	1
the	0
cuff	0
remark	0
about	0
lawyers	1
about	1
uh	0
their	0
integrity	1
being	0
questionable	1
and	0

and	0
i	1
mean	0
oh	1
that	1
was	0
like	0
a	1
can	1
of	0
worms	0

probably	0
you	0
probably	1
got	0
everybody	1
on	1
you	1
because	0
they	1
were	0
probably	0
all	1
going	1
to	0
law	1
school	0

no	1
no	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
woman	0
she	0
said	1
my	1
my	1
best	0
friends	1
are	1
lawyers	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
all	1
this	0
and	1
it	0
was	1
just	1

well	0
that	1
remark	1
in	0
itself	1
is	1
a	0
slam	1
my	0
best	0
friends	1
are	0
lawyers	1

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
it	0

you	1
know	0
like	0
like	1
uh	0
you	0
know	0
my	1
best	0
friends	1
are	0
blacks	1

or	0
Jewish	0
it	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
Jewish	0
you	0
know	0

jewish	1
now	0
blacks	0
and	1

yeah	0

and	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
i	1
guess	1
uh	0
Iraqi	1
now	0
is	0
the	0

i	1
know	0
it	0
but	1

law	1
law	1
was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
until	0
you	1
get	1
to	0
law	1
school	1

yeah	0

and	0
it	1
doesn't	1
become	0
fun	0
anymore	0

yeah	0
i	1
have	0
a	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
friend	1
she's	0
studying	1
she's	0
going	0
into	0
law	1
another	0
friend	0
going	1
into	1
law	0
and	1
that	0
she's	0
i	0
i	0
i'm	1
really	0
i'm	0
really	0
concerned	0
about	0
you	0
know	0
she's	0
just	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
you	0
know	1
what's	1
going	0
to	0
happen	1
when	0
she	0
gets	0
there	1

yeah	1
you	0
going	0

you	0
know	0
all	1
of	0
her	0
dreams	1
will	0
be	0
dispelled	1

oh	0
yeah	0
Yeah	0
if	1
if	1
if	0
you've	0
ever	1
seen	1
the	0
program	1
paper	1
chase	0
it's	0
very	1
much	0
like	0
that	1
except	0
worse	1

yeah	0

yeah	1
it's	0
i	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
probably	1
more	1
embarrassing	1
and	0
very	0
painful	1

it	0
is	0

i	0
i	0
see	0
i	0
see	0
that	0
happening	0

yeah	0
very	0
much	0
so	0

yeah	0
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
Um	0

yeah	0

it	1
it	1
was	0
enjoyable	1
for	0
a	0
while	1
um	0
but	0
it's	0
such	1
a	0
grind	1

yeah	0

and	0
you	0
begin	0
to	0
wonder	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
if	0
i'm	0
not	0
i	0
mean	0
you	1
really	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
dead	1
set	1
on	0
being	1
a	0
lawyer	1
to	1
do	1
it	0
if	0

uh-huh	0

if	0
you	1
have	0
any	1
doubts	0
whatsoever	1
you	0
better	1
not	0
get	0
into	0
it	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0
i	1
wasted	0
a	0
year	1
and	0
a	0
half	0
of	0
awfully	1
hard	0
and	0
i	1
aged	0
ten	1
years	0

uh-huh	0

but	1
i	0
i	1
i	0
wouldn't	1
trade	0
the	0
experience	1
for	0
anything	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
never	1
hurts	0
to	0
have	1
some	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
grounding	1
in	0
law	1

yeah	0
i	1
i	0
went	1
to	0
a	0
language	1
school	0
and	1
and	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
it	1
was	0
a	0
an	0
i	0
guess	1
uh	0
United	1
States	0
Institution	1
it	0
was	0
i	0
was	0
military	1
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
probably	0
the	0
biggest	0

what	0
branch	0
were	0
you	0
in	0

huh	0

what	0
branch	0
were	0
you	0
in	0

i	1
was	0
in	0
the	0
Air	1
Force	0

i	0
was	0
too	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
for	0
myself	0
i	0
mean	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
military	0
experience	0
was	0
fine	0
it	0
was	0
just	1
i	0
just	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
was	0
something	0
else	1
that	0
that	1
that	0
i	0
could	1

IBM	1
they	0
they	0
make	0
you	0
wear	0
a	0
blue	1

and	0
uh	0
some	0
kind	1
of	0
colored	0
shirt	1
and	0

that's	1
what	1
i've	0
heard	1

uh-huh	0
i	1
wou[ld]	1
i	0
would	0
hate	1
to	0
be	1
in	1
that	1
atmosphere	1

but	0
uh	0
i	0
mean	0
they	1
they	0
just	0
moved	1
into	0
the	1
new	1
building	0
he	0
calls	1
it	1
the	0
new	1
building	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
it's	1
where	0
all	1
the	1
executives	1
are	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
um	0
and	0
so	0
they	1
were	1
they	0
were	1
going	1
to	0
try	1
to	1
take	1
their	0
blue	1
jean	0
code	0
with	1
them	1
and	0
trying	1
to	1
get	1
all	0
the	0
all	0
the	0
upper	1
level	1
to	1
start	1
wearing	0
blue	1
jeans	0
but	1
he	1
just	0
left	1
for	1
Italy	1
today	1
at	0
four	1

oh	1

and	0
he'll	1
be	0
over	0
there	1
until	0
July	1
first	1
setting	1
up	0
some	1
kind	0
of	0
computers	1
for	0
them	1

i	1
see	1

over	1
in	0
TI	1
mean	0
for	1
TI	0
but	0
over	1
in	0
Italy	1

yeah	0
oh	0
TI	1
is	0
everywhere	1

oh	1
yeah	1
he	1
was	0
so	0
excited	1
about	0
going	1

uh-huh	1

but	1
uh	0
he	1
didn't	0
carry	0
any	1
ties	1
or	0
anything	1
because	0
he	0
he	1
just	0
went	1
over	1
there	0
with	1
the	0
that	0
attitude	1
that	1
well	1
if	0
i	0
don't	0
take	1
it	0
then	0
they	1
won't	0
make	0
me	1
wear	1
it	1

that's	1
true	1
that's	0
a	0
good	1
idea	0

because_1	0
uh	1
he	1
just	1
he	1
didn't	0
you	1
know	0
he's	1
not	0
really	1
into	1
all	0
that	0
he	1
would	1
wear	1
it	1
if	0
he	1
had	1
to	0
for	1
his	0
job	1
and	0
all	0
but	0
you	1
know	0
if	1
he	1
had	0
the	1
preference	1
i	1
mean	0
his	1
his	0
preference	1
is	0
um	0
blue	1
jeans	0
and	1
a	0
T-shirt	1
so	0

uh-huh	1

but	1
i	1
think	1
that's	0
great	1
about	1
TI	0
and	0
also	1
uh	0
to	1
get	1
off	1
the	0
clothing	1
the	0
smokers	1
you	1
know	0
how	0
they	0
have	1
the	0
the	0
different	1
designated	0
areas	1
for	0
smokers	1
and	0
stuff	1
i	1

the	0
no	0

right	1

i	1
think	0
that's	0
great	1

yeah	0
and	0
if	0
you	0
happen	1
to	0
go	1
into	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
areas	1
that	0
is	1
a	0
smoke	0
smoke	1
area	1
and	0
you	0
don't	1
smoke	0
you	0
almost	0
strangle	1

oh	0
really	1
do	0
you	1
smoke	1

so	1
much	0
smoke	1
in	0
the	0
air	1
yeah	1
areas	0
the	0
smoking	1
area	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
closed	1
in	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
if	0
you	1
don['t]	0
if	1
you	0
don't	1
smoke	0
and	0
you	0
go	0
in	1
there	0
tha[t]	0
everybody	1
that	0
goes	0
in	0
there	0
smokes	1
so	0
it's	0
full	1
of	0
smoke	0
when	0
when	1
you	0
go	0
in	0
there	1
i	0
used	1
to	0
smoke	1
a	0
long	0
time	1
ago	1

think	1
that's	0
um	0

always	1
told	0
me	0
it	0
was	0
because	1
i	0
was	0
still	0
growing	1
and	0
she	0
wasn't	0
going	0
to	0
buy	1
me	0
something	0
i	0
was	0
going	0

outgrowing	1
stuff	1

this	0
you	0
know	0
so	0
now	1
she	0
finds	1
the	0
basement	1
sales	1
and	0
just	0
like	1
you	1

everybody	0

that's	0
the	0
best	1
way	0
to	0
shop	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
always	0
thought	0
my	0
mom	0
was	0
being	0
mean	1
to	0
me	0

i	1
look	0
back	1
at	0
it	0

mine	1
the	0
same	0
way	1

right	1

um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0
just	0
ah	0

just	0
so	0
outrageously	0
priced	1
it's	0
just	0
incredible	1

yes	1
and	0
your[self]	0

i	0
try	1
to	0
uh	0
always	1
catch	0
the	0
sales	1

right	1

always	1

and	0
yeah	0
and	0
you	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
keep	1
buying	1
them	0
you	0
know	1
if	0
you	0
if	0
you	0
if	0
you're	0
not	0
buying	1
the	0
most	1
expensive	1
clothes	1
out	0
there	0
the	0
the	0
quality	1
is	0
really	0
not	0
that	0
great	1
you	0
know	0
for	0
the	0
price	1
that	0
you	0
pay	1

yeah	1
it	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
um	1
yeah	0
there's	1
there's	1
always	1
a	0
reason	0
why	1
they're	1
on	0
sale	1

right	1

so	0
that	0
that	1
has	0
a	0
lot	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
it	1

right	0

but	0
um	0
well	1

like	0
i	1
bought	0
i	1
bought	1
the	0
most	0
beautiful	1
sw[eater]	0
uh	0
sweater	1
from	1
uh	0
i	0
believe	0
it	0
was	0
Ross	1
Dress	1
For	0
Less	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
it	0
wa[s]	0
it	0
was	0
really	1
pretty	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
was	0
just	0
plain	1
a	0
plain	1
uh	0
ro[und]	0
you	0
know	0
round	1
uh	0
necked	1
uh	0
sw[eater]	0
sweater	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
it	0
had	1
uh	0
like	0
it	0
was	0
embellished	1
around	1
the	0
the	0
top	1
you	0
know	0
it	0
had	1
uh	0
leather	1
leather	1
designs	1
and	0
um	0
some	1
othe[r]	0
other	1
little	1
things	1
on	0
it	1
and	0
i	1
just	1
thought	1
it	0
was	1
so	1
pretty	1
and	1
i	0
go[t]	1
i	0
got	1
it	0
at	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
price	1
i	0
think	0
maybe	1
it	0
was	0
nine	1
ninety	0
nine	1
or	0
something	0

oh	1
that's	0
great	1

and	1
it	0
was	0
so	1
pretty	1
and	1
after	0
i	0
wore	1
it	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
times	1
i	0
realized	1
why	1
[laughter-it]	0
[laughter-was]	0
why	1
it	0
was	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1

huh	0
oh	1

there	1
was	0
in	0
the	1
middle	1
of	0
the	0
back	1
of	0
it	0
there	1
was	0
it's	0
like	1
there	0
it	1
had	0
been	0
slit	1
and	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
just	0
sewed	1
it	0
back	1
together	1
right	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
[laughter-the]	0
the	0
back	1
you	0
know	0
wasn't	0

oh	1
no	1

wasn't	0
a	0
seam	1
or	0
anything	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
that's	1
why	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1
although	1
it's	0
not	1
it's	0
not	1
really	1
noticeable	1
um	0
from	1
the	0
outside	1
but	0
but	0
still	1
it's	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
really	0
not	1
not	0
not	1
a	0
good	0
quality	1

and	0
then	1
i	0
was	0
told	1
by	0
somebody	1
that	0
works	1
for	0
JC	0
Penney's	1
that	0
um	0
Ross	1
Ross	1
is	0
just	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
places	1
that	0
sell[s]	0
sells	0
seconds	1

the	0
defect	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
um	0
they	0
don't	1
really	0
buy	1
the	0
first	0
quality	1
they	0
buy	0
the	0
[laughter-second]	1
and	1
uh	0
places	1
like	0
JC	0
Penney's	1
that	0
they'll	0
reject	1
the	0
seconds	0
they'll	0
send	0
them	0
back	1
every	0
time	1
but	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
places	1
like	0
Ross	1
Dress	1
For	0
Less	1
and	0
uh	0
TJ	1
Max	1

TJ	1
Max	1
does	0
that	0
yeah	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
we	1
have	0
a	0
TJ	0
Max	0
over	0
here	1
and	0
um	0

okay	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
talk	1
describe	1
uh	1
job	1
benefits	1
and	1
so	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
uh	1
next	1
to	1
salary	1
do	0
you	1
rank	1
is	1
the	0
most	1
important	1
job	0
benefits	1

uh	1
i	1
would	1
say	1
the	1
medical	1
uh	1
group	1
insurance	1
uh	0
area	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
uh	1
covering	1
medical	1
costs	1
for	0
yourself	1
or	1
family	1
members	1

uh-huh	1

um-hum	1
well	1
um	0
does	1
your	0
company	1
have	1
good	1
benefits	1
in	0
that	1
in	1
that	1
regard	1

yeah	1
i	0
thin[k]	0
i	1
work	1
for	0
a	1
a	1
public	1
school	1
system	1
district	1
and	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	1
so	1
it's	1
different	1
than	1
a	0
company	1
where	1
most	0
companies	1
fund	1
almost	1
the	0
entire	1
thing	1
where	1
the	1
school	1
district	1
does	1
um	1
the	1
employee	1
must	0
pick	1
up	0
a	1
greater	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
uh	1
costs	1

oh	1
yeah	1

but	1
i[t]	1
overall	1
um	0
i've	0
been	1
pleased	1
with	1
it	1
over	1
the	0
years	1

um-hum	1

i	0
think	1
the	1
biggest	1
frustration	1
is	1
because	1
of	0
the	1
cost	1
of	1
insurance	1
going	1
up	1
every	0
year	1
our	1
district	1
has	1
had	1
to	0
alter	1
uh	1
you	1
know	0
change	1
companies	1
or	1
now	1
we're	1
on	0
a	1
managed	1
care	1
thing	1
which	0
has	1
stressed	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
people	1
out	1
although	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
disturbed	1
me	1
any	1

hm	0

i	1
see	0

how	1
about_1	1
yourself	1

uh	0
well	1
i'm	1
my	1
medical	0
coverage	0
is	1
with	1
an	0
HMO	1

uh-huh	0

um	0
so	1
that's	1
in	0
my	1
opinion	0
that's	1
gett[ing]	0
that's	0
bordering	1
on	0
a	1
health	1
clinic	0
but	1
it	0
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
to	0
maintain	1
costs	1
and	0
still	1
provide	0
a	0
good	1
amount	0
of	0
coverage	1

right	1
yeah	1
our	1

um	0

our	1
district	1
did	1
that	1
for	0
the	1
ninety	1
one	1
and	0
the	1
ninety	1
school	1
year	1
or	0
calendar	1
years	1
and	1
i	0
was	1
in	1
the	0
HMO	1
and	1
um	0
i	0
i	0
was	1
because	1
my	1
my	0
same	1
doctor	1
you	1
know	1
agreed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
it	0
for	1
uh	0
they	1
usually	1
sign	1
a	0
contract	1
or	1
something	1

um-hum	0

and	0
um	1
uh	1
i	1
did	1
have	0
surgery	1
last	0
summer	1
and	1
i	1
paid	1
ten	0
dollars	1
when	1
i	1
went	0
to	1
see	1
him	0
that	1
first	1
day	0
and	0
i've	0
never	1
seen	1
another	0
bill	1
so	0
i	1
i	0
have	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
really	0
works	1
but	0

right	1

but	0
again	1
i	1
was	0
fortunate	1
because	1
my	1
doctor	0
agreed	1
to	1
be	0
in	1
it	1
uh	1
if	0
you've	1
been	0
going	1
to	0
a	1
doctor	1
for	1
you	1
know	1
ten	0
years	1
or	0
something	1
and	0
he	1
elects	0
not	1
to	0
join	1
it	1
can	1
be	0
very	1
stressful	1
for	0
you	0
know	1
those	0
people	1

yes	1

that's	0
right	1
yeah	0
i'm	0
i'm	0
fairly	0
young	1
myself	1
i've	0
only	1
been	1
when	0
i	0
first	1
started	0
working	1
which	0
three	1
years	0
ago	0
is	0
when	0
i	0
first	1
got	0
into	0
full	1
time	0
employment	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
at	0
that	1
time	0
i	0
immediately	1
joined	0
the	0
HMO	1
and	0
i	0
never	1
really	0
so	0
the	0
only	0
doctor	1
i	0
i've	0
kind	0
of	0
consistently	1
had	1
has	0
been	1
through	0
the	0
HMO	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
for	0
me	1
it's	1
worked	1
out	0
real	1
good	1

yeah	1

right	1
but	0
if	0
you	1
you	1
know	0
have	0
a	0
family	1
and	0
and	0
um	0
everybody's	1
gone	1
to	0
different	1
doctors	1
uh	0
it	0
is	1
hard	0
to	0
give	1
up	1
somebody	0
who	1
you	1
feel	1
knows	1
you	0
and	0
your	0
body	1
and	0
your	0
just	1
has	0
you	1
know	0
all	1
the	0
medical	0
history	1
and	0
you	0
feel	0
comfortable	1
with	0
it	0
i	0

um-hum	1

i	0
i'm	0
sure	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
very	1
stressful	0
and	0
my	0
husband	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
just	0
elected	1
that	0
if	0
that	0
happens	1
i	1
will	0
go	0
and	0
just	0
pay	1
you	0
can	1
continue	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
your	0
own	1
doctor	1

hm	1

but	0
your	0
benefits	1
are	0
not	1
as	0
you	1
know	0
good	1
so	0
uh	0

um-hum	0
yeah	1
um	0
like	0
you	1
you	0
mentioned	1
you	0
work	0
for	0
a	0
school	1
system	0
i	1
work	0
for	0
uh	0
Georgia	1
Tech	1
in	0
the	0
research	1
branch	1

oh	0
all	1
right	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
another	1
one	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
i	1
rank	0
up	0
there	0
high	1
is	0
the	1
uh	0
kind	0
of	0
job	1
flexibility	0
and	0
time	1
off	1
um	0
i	1
enjoy	0
as	0
a	0
as	0
a	0
benefit	1

i	1
do	0
too	1
are	0
you	0
talking	1
about	0
like	0
spring	1
break	1
and	0

right	1
yeah	1

right	1

yeah	1
getting	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
breaks	1
between	1
quarters	1
and	0
that	1
and	0
having	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
vacation	1

right	1

it	1
it	0
really	1
um	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
most	1
of	0
our	0
teachers	1
now	0
i'm	1
not	0
a	0
teacher	1
i	1
am	1
the	0
a	1
secretarial	1
executive	1
assistant	1
but	1
i	1
don't	0
think	0
the	0
teachers	1
could	1
stand	0
the	0
stress	1
[laughter-all]	0
all	1
year	0
long	1
frankly	1
it	1

um-hum	0

it	1
is	0
just	1
Texas	1
has	0
really	1
um	0
you	1
know	1
they	1
want	1
everybody	1
educated	1
no	0
matter	0
what	1
it's	0
costs	1
uh	1
and	0
it	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
just	1
we	0
all	1
look	0
forward	1
to	0
like	1
in	0
two	0
weeks	1
we	0
have	0
spring	1
break	1
and	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
who	0
looks	0
forward	1
to	0
it	1
more	1
the	0
students	1
or	0
the	0
or	0
the	0
teachers	1
and	0
the	0
[laughter-staff]	1

um-hum	0

right	1

what	1
do	0
you	0
do	1
there	0

well	1
um	0
i'm	1
not	1
actually	1
on	0
the	1
teaching	1
faculty	0
but	1
we	1
have	1
a	0
large	1
research	1
organization	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
that's	1
who	1
i	0
work	1
with	0

okay	1

um	0
and	0
we're	0
given	1
you	1
know	0
a	0
good	1
bit	0
of	0
flexibility	1
in	0
what	0
we	0
do	1
we	0
can	0
kind	0
of	0
pursue	1
our	0
own	0
interests	1
in	0
terms	1
of	0
the	0
research	1
areas	0
that	0
we	1
study	1

well	1
that's	1
good	1
yeah	1
i	1
would	0
think	1
that	0
that	1
type	1
of	0
employment	1
you're	0
you're	0
one	1
day	0
you	0
might	0
be	0
really	1
tuned	0
in	0
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
oh	0
a	0
little	0
lukewarm	1
or	0
something	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
it's	1
good	1
that	0
they	0
allow	1
you	0
that	1

right	1

it	0
um	0
a[s]	0
i	0
say	1
the	0
schools	1
now	0
we	1
do	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
day	1
but	0
we	0
do	1
get	0
many	1
days	0
off	1
and	0
um	0
we	0
all	0
look	0
forward	1
to	0
it	1
that's	1

um-hum	0

that's	1
only	0
reason	0
i	0
work	1
there	0
is	0
that	0
my	0
children	1
now	0
have	0
graduated	1
and	1
graduated	0
from	0
college	1
but	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
i	0
worked	1
there	0
because	1
my	1
hours	1
and	0
days	1
were	0
the	0
same	1
as	0
theirs	1

oh	0
yeah	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	1
i've	1
just	0
continued	1
to	1
uh	0
stay	1
there	0
so	0

are	1
there	1
are	0
there	1
any	1
things	0
that	0
that	0
you'd	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
changed	1
in	0
terms	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
benef[its]	1

i've	1
uh	1
i've	1
well	1
i've	1
had	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
there	1
wa[s]	1
that	1
there	1
really	1
wasn't	1
any	0
more	1
crime	1
in	1
America	1
in	0
the	0
cities	1
anyway	1
than	0
there	0
was	1
in	1
previous	0
centuries	1
uh	1
before	1
uh	1
simply	1
because	1
the	1
reason	1
there	0
seems	1
to	1
be	0
so	1
much	1
was	1
the	0
fact	1
that	1
the	1
police	1
now	0
had	1
advanced	1
uh	0
reporting	1
methods	1
with	1
computers	1
and	1
other	1
devices	1

compile	1
more	1
statistics	1

that's	0
right	0
and	0
those	0
statistics	1
in	0
turn	1
got	0
them	1
bigger	1
budgets	1

um-hum	1

however	1
i	0
have	0
been	0
persuaded	1
lately	0
i	0
guess	1
simply	1
by	0
the	1
uh	0
overwhelming	1
data	0
that	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
available	1
that	1
there	1
is	0
indeed	1
a	0
lot	1
more	1
violent	1
crime	1

more	1
especially	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
in	1
Washington	0
DC	1
or	1
Washington	0
state	0

well	0
yeah	1

no	0
i	0
am	1
in	1
i	0
am	0
in	0
Washington	1
D	0
C	1

yeah	0
yeah	1
i	1
was	0
going	1
to	0
say	1

actually	0
it	0
you	1
know	1
i	0
do	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
business	1
here	1
and	1
i	1
come	1
here	1
quite	0
often	1
and	1
and	1
that	1
again	1
is	1
a	1
is	1
a	0
sort	1
of	0
media	0
perception	1
there's	1
some	1
absolutely	1
lovely	1
and	1
marvelous	1
and	0
peaceful	1
areas	0
in	0
Washington	1
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
racial	1
makeup	1
but	0

oh	1
yeah	1

but	0
it's	1
it's	0
these	0
real	0
uh	0
there's	0
pockets	0
of	0
violence	1
that	0
is	0
so	1
violent	1
that	0
they	1
uh	1

it	0
just	0
really	1
grabs	1
your	1
attention	1
it	1

yeah	0

it	1
just	1
makes	0
the	1
whole	1
place	1
seem	1
like	0
that	1

right	0
now	1
just	1
to	1
focus	1
on	0
that	1
a	0
minute	1
i	1
guess	0
uh	0
um	1
when	0
um	1
previous	1
secretary	1
of	0
uh	1
educate	1
Bennett	1
i	0
think	0
his	1
name	0
was	1
became	1
the	0
drug	1
czar	1
uh	1
for	0
uh	1
uh	1
President	1
Bush	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	0
focus	1
on	0
it	1
on	1
this	0
area	1
and	1
do	1
something	1
about	1
it	1
and	1

yeah	0

and	1
i	1
see	0
that	1
even	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
without	1
with	1
with	1
little	1
success	1
even	1
though	1
the	0
entire	1
i	0
guess	1
a	1
a	0
quite	1
a	1
bit	1
of	0
money	1
and	1
and	1
other	1
uh	1
planning	1
efforts	1
went	1
into	0
that	1

what	1
do	0
you	1
what	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
is	1
is	1
causing	1
all	0
this	1
because	0

well	0

because	0
it	0
seems	0
that	0
there	0
there	0
even	1
though	1
crime	1
though	1
though	0
i	1
think	0
it	1
is	1
increasing	0
in	1
number	1
it	0
sure	1
does	1
seem	0
to	0
be	1
increasing	1
in	1
intensity	1
and	1
violence	1
too	1

yes	0

well	0
i	1
uh	0
i	1
have	1
three	0
theories	1
about	0
it	1
you	1
know	1
three	0
things	1
i	0
have	0
one	1
theory	0
and	0
it's	1
by	0
two	0
things	1
one	1
i	1
i	1
believe	1
that	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
function	1
of	0
uh	0
the	0
violence	1
that	1
young	0
people	1
see	1
on	0
television	1
and	0
in	0
the	0
movies	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
am	0
not	1
just	0
talking	0
about	1
you	0
know	0
uh	0
role	1
models	0
of	1
uh	0
of	0
tough	0
guys	1
and	0
gangsters	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
not	0
even	1
i'm	0
not	1
even	1
convinced	1
that	0
maybe	0
things	1
like	0
uh	0
football	1
hockey	1
and	1
the	1
the	0
and	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
the	1
the	1
and	1
even	0
baseball	1
games	1
now	1
where	1
the	1
everything	1
is	1
settled	1
with	0
a	0
fight	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
the	0
immediate	0
need	1
to	1
show	0
some	1
sort	0
of	0
violence	1
to	0
settle	1
the	0
uh	0
the	0
argument	1
and	1

and	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
i	1
am	1
an	1
advocate	1
of	1
hand	1
gun	1
control	1
to	0
some	0
degree	1
so	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
particularly	0
i	0
i	0
was	0
reading	1
the	0
other	0
day	1
about	0
uh	1
Corpus	1
Christi	0
Texas	1
which	1
has	1
the	1
highest	1
i	0
think	1
it's	1
Corp[us]	1
Corpus	0
Christi	1
that	1
had	0
the	0
highest	1
rates	0
per	1
hand	1
gun	0
death	0
in	0
America	1
uh	0
per	0
capita	1
i	0

hum	0

yeah	0
i	1
i	1
haven't	1
seen	1
that	0
but	1
uh	1

i	0
mean	0
the	0
Saturday	0
night	0
special	0
stuff	0
so	0

yeah	0

that	1
that's	0
what	0
i	1
think	0
about	1
it	0
that's	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
i	0
think	0
about	1
it	0
plus	0
uh	0
i	0
know	0
what	0
are	0
your	0
views	0

well	0
yeah	0
i	1
tend	1
to	0
agree	1
with	0
you	0
with	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
seems	1
anymore	1
uh	0
a	0
movie	1
can	0
not	0
be	0
considered	1
good	1
unless	1
there's	1
just	0
some	1
some	1
sort	0
of	0
violence	1
or	0
something	0
in	0
it	1
and	0

yes	0

and	0
and	0
along	0
with	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
and	1
then	0
you	0
start	1
making	0
a	1
movie	1
and	1
it	1
it	0
has	0
no	1
there's	0
no	0
call	1
for	0
something	0
violent	1
but	0
so	0
they	0
just	0
throw	1
something	0
in	1
there	1
just	0
to	0
say	0
they	0
have	1
it	0

exac[tly]	0
well	0
that's	1
that's	1
that's	0
the	0
impression	1
i	0
get	1
yeah	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
and	0
i	0
imagine	1
it's	0
it	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
feeds	1
upon	0
itself	1
when	1
when	0
we	1
have	1
this	0
sort	0
of	0
violence	1
in	0
society	1
people	1
want	1
to	0
it	0
conditions	0
people	1
to	0
it	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
emph[asize]	0
it	1
has	0
to	0
be	1
even	1
uh	0
magnified	1
to	1
attract	1
people's	0
attention	1
i	0
guess	0
to	0
have	1
them	1
spend	0
money	1
on	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	1
you	0
become	0
callous	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
am	0
sure	1
that	0
it	0
does	1
form	0
role	0
models	1
for	0
young	1
for	0
young	0
men	1
and	0
young	0
women	1
and	0

yeah	1

uh	0
i	1
mean	0
i	1
i	0
read	1
now	1
where	1
where	1
you	1
know	1
women	1
are	0
arr[ested]	1
young	0
women	0
are	0
arrested	1
fighting	1
with	0
knives	1
over	1
over	1
whatever	1
whatever	1
reason	0
which	0
is	1
kind	0
of	0
unheard	1
of	0
when	0
i	0
was	0
young	1
now	0

um	0

now	0
i	0
do	0
not	0
want	0
to	0
sound	1
like	0
an	0
old	0
fart	1
but	0
but	0
that	0
that's	0
what	0

seems	0
that	1
those	0
things	0
happened	1
before	1
it	0
didn't	1
happen	0
in	0
that	1
manner	1
before	0
television	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
i	1
i	1
i	0
have	1
to	0
think	1
that	0
that	0
it	1
has	0
some	0
influence	1
on	0
it	1
but	0

i	1
listening	1
to	0
a	1
radio	1
talk	1
show	1
today	1
at	1
lunch	1
time	1
uh	0
Rush	1
Limbaugh	1
i	1

yeah	0

i	1
do	0
not	1
know	1
if	0
you	1
listen	1
to	0
him	1
or	1
not	1
he's	1

no	0

he's	1
on	0
AM	1
but	0
uh	1
there	1
there's	1
a	1
fellow	1
that	1
had	1
called	0
in	1
and	1
was	1
lamenting	1
about	1
the	1
uh	1
that	1
there	1
was	0
a	1
interview	1
done	0
on	0
the	1
assistant	1
chief	1
of	0
police	1
for	0
Los	0
Angeles	1
the	0
guy	1
under	0
Gates	1

oh	0
yes	0

and	0
they	1
were	0
just	0
really	1
coming	1
down	1
on	0
him	0
because	0
of	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
things	1
he	0
was	1
just	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
he	1
believed	1
in	0
some	1
of	0
his	0
morals	1
for	0
instance	1
uh	0
they	0
asked	0
him	1
if	0
he	0
spanked	1
his	0
kids	1
and	0
he	0
said	0
you	0
bet	0
i	0
believe	1
in	0
discipline	1
and	0
people	1
i	1
i	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
they	0
confuse	1
confused	0
discipline	1
with	0
punishment	1

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
ju[st]	0
it	0
seems	1
anymore	1
that	0
uh	0
if	1
if	0
you	0
have	1
you	1
know	1
this	1
type	0
of	1
a	0
moral	1
stance	1
that	1
people	1
come	1
down	1
on	1
you	0
it's	1
like	1
you	0
know	1
hey	1
everybody	0
has	1
to	0
be	1
free	1
to	0
do	1
their	0
own	1
thing	1
and	0
i	0
disagree	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that's	1
really	1
contributing	1
to	0
this	1
high	1
rate	0
of	0
crime	1

yes	0
yes	0
well	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
i	0
guess	1
so	1
what	0
i	1
wanted	1
to	0
say	1
and	0
i	1
stopped	1
uh	0
i	0
do	1
not	0
know	1
i	1
got	0
diverted	1
was	0
uh	0
that	1
uh	0
there's	0
so	0
mu[ch]	1
there's	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
a	0
return	1
from	0
pris[on]	1
to	1
prison	1
that	0
the	0
rehabilitation	1
programs	1
seem	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
failure	1
and	1
and	1
that	1
is	0
not	0
emphasized	1
i	0
recognize	1
there's	1
there's	0
over	0
crowding	1
problems	1
and	1
and	0
since	1
we	0
have	0
decided	0
to	0
put	0
everybody	1
in	0
jail	1
that	0
commits	1
a	0
crime	0
now	1
that	0
that's	1
complicated	1
the	0
entire	0
process	1

yeah	0

what	0
i	0
also	0
think	0
is	0
that	0
i	0
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
the	0
reflection	1
of	1
of	0
the	0
society	1
where	1
where	1
we	0
have	0
so	1
much	0
more	0
mobility	1
and	0
less	1
attachment	1
to	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
it	0
does	0
not	0
seem	1
to	0
be	0
any	0
responsibility	1
to	0
the	0
community	1
where	0
you	1
where	0
you	0
live	1
or	0
i	0
do	0
not	1
mean	0
respons[ibility]	1
attachment	1
and	0
responsibility	1
i	0
guess	0
i	0
mean	1
any	0
sort	1
of	1

well	0
nobody	0
feels	1
responsibility	0
to	0
do	0
something	1
it's	0
like	0
oh	0
boy	1
i	0
wish	1
they	0
would	0
stop	1
doing	0
that	1
[laughter-yeah]	0

yes	0
that's	0
right	0
th[at]	0

[laughter-yeah]	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	0
do	0
not	0
know	0
how	0
that's	0
i	0
do	0
not	1
think	0
it's	0
done	0
by	1
uh	0
the	0
changes	0
come	1
simply	1
by	0
statutory	1
nature	1
i	0
do	1
not	0
know	0
what	1
it	0
really	0
will	0
take	1

hum	1

and	0
i	0
do	0
not	1
know	0
if	0
i	0
have	0
solutions	1
except	1
except	1
to	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
am	0
sort	1
of	0
a	1
a	0
an	0
advocate	1
of	1
of	0
uh	0
of	0
letting	1
people	1
of	0
having	1
free	0
speech	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
to	0
curb	1
uh	0
television	1
uh	0
the	0
violence	1
on	0
television	1
and	0
in	0
the	0
movies	1
would	0
be	0
contrary	1
to	0
my	0
beliefs	1
in	0
that	1

yeah	0

however	0
there	0
does	1
seem	0
to	0
be	0
a	1
right	0
now	0
in	0
verbalizing	0
it	0
does	1
seem	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
higher	1
need	1
for	0
something	0
of	0
that	0
sort	1

yeah	1
and	1
then	1
how	1
many	1

and	0
the	0
sacrifice	0
isn't	0
that	0
great	0

how	0
how	1
many	0
studies	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
to	0
show	1
that	0
there	0
is	1
a	1
link	1
between	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
see	1
and	1
how	1
you	1
i	0

yeah	0

i	0
mean	1
what	0
you	1
see	0
affects	0
how	1
you	1
think	0
and	0
therefore	0
what	0
you	0
do	0

yes	1
yes	0
i	1
think	0
i	0
think	1
that's	0
correct	1

and	0
and	0
yes	0
but	0
you	0
know	0
as	0
soon	0
as	0
you	0
start	0
uh	0

well	0
Texas	1
has	1
uh	0
Texas	1
has	0
uh	0
has	0
always	1
struck	0
me	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
i	1
i	0
have	0
lived	1
in	0
and	0
out	0
of	0
Texas	1
both	0
in	0
the	0
service	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
uh	0
short	0
business	1
stints	1
and	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
me	0
they	0
are	0
a	0
pretty	1
pretty	1
tough	1
law	1
and	0
order	0
state	1
but	0
but	0
yet	1
that	0
does	1
not	0
seem	1
to	0
have	0
effected	1
the	0
amount	0
of	0
violent	1
right	0
in	0
the	1
state	1
just	0
citing	1
that	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	0
uh	1
unfortunately	1
you	0
man	0
got	1
a	1
lot	0
of	0
the	1
uh	0
some	1
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	1
can	1
be	1
contributed	1
to	1
the	1
the	0
the	0
racial	1
differences	1
i	0
mean	0
just	1
you	0
know	0
we	0
are	0
so	0
close	1
to	0
the	0
border	1
with	1
Mexico	1
we've	0

yeah	0

we've	0
got	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
that	1
influence	1

yeah	0

i'll	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
first	1

oh	1
well	1
what's	1
there	1
to	1
say	1
doesn't	1
seem	1
like	1
it's	0
being	1
carried	1
out	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
seems	0
like	1
it	1
takes	1
so	1
long	1
between	1
conviction	1
and	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
penalty	1
that	0
i	1
don't	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
makes	1
any	1
difference	1
to	0
sentence	1
anybody	1

yeah	1
it	1
seems	1
like	1
they	1
could	1
die	1
of	1
old	1
age	1
waiting	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
death	1
penalty	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean	1
um	1
i	1
in	0
Maryland	1
they	1
they	1
do	1
have	1
capital	1
punishment	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	1
i've	1
seen	1
uh	0
a	1
lot	1
of	1
people	1
get	0
convicted	1
sentenced	1
and	0
then	1
just	1
nothing	1
happens	0
just	1
endless	1
endless	1
endless	1
appeals	1

yeah	0

uh-huh	0
well	1
from	0
what	0
i	1
underst[and]	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
statistic	1
just	1
a	0
few	1
days	1
ago	1
um	1
so	1
far	0
this	1
ye[ar]	1
year	1
or	1
was	0
it	0
during	1
the	0
last	1
year	0
somewh[ere]	1
during	1
a	0
years	1
time	1
i	0
think	1
it	1
was	0
they	0
executed	1
twenty	1
five	1
people	1
in	0
the	1
nation	1
meanwhile	1
there	1
were	1
twenty	1
five	1
hundred	1
people	0
on	1
death	1
row	1

so	0
i	0
i	1
and	0
it's	1
building	1
up	1
you	0
know	1
they're	1
they're	1
convicting	1
them	1
faster	1
than	0
they're	1
executing	1
them	0
so	0
it's	1
really	1
building	1
up	1

yeah	1
what's	1
amazing	1
is	0
some	1
of	0
them	1
have	0
been	1
on	0
death	1
row	1
for	0
a	0
number	1
of	0
years	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
uh	0
here	1
in	1
Maryland	1
i	0
know	1
we	1
have	0
a	1
real	1
problem	1
with	0
overcrowding	1
in	0
prisons	1
uh	1
just	0

yeah	1
everybody's	1
got	1
that	0

yeah	0
but	1
i	0
mean	1
in	0
here	1
it's	0
uh	1
to	1
the	0
point	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
letting	1
prisoners	1
go	1
uh	0
commuting	1
the	0
sentences	1
of	0
those	1
that	0
were	0
in	1
in	0
jail	1
for	0
lesser	1
crimes	0
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
more	1
people	0
in	1
into	1
the	1
jails	1
and	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
uh	0
amazing	1
to	1
me	1
and	0
of	0
course	1
they	1
made	1
a	0
big	0
deal	1
out	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
few	1
that	0
got	0
out	1
and	1
turned	0
around	1
and	0
committed	1
a	0
crime	1
within	0
five	1
days	1
of	1
getting	1
out	1
and	1
being	0
rearrested	1
and	0

yeah	0

isn't	0
isn't	1
Maryland	1
where	0
the	0
famous	1
Willy	0
Horton	1
case	0
was	0

uh	0
i	1
can't	1
remember	1
refresh	1
my	1
memory	0

it	1
was	0
uh	0
that	1
was	0
the	0
one	0
that	0
was	1
used	1
so	0
much	1
in	0
the	1
campaign	1
in	0
the	1
politica[l]	1
in	0
the	0
presidential	1
race	0
uh	0
may	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
have	0
been	0
Maryland	1
it	0
may	1
have	0
been	0
Massachusetts	1
i	0
don't	1
remember	0

um	1
i	1
don't	1
remember	1
myself	1

anyway	1
well	0
the	0
question	1
is	1
you	0
know	1
do	1
you	0
think	1
i[t]	1
it	1
does	1
make	0
a	0
difference	1
in	0
whether	1
or	0
not	0
a	0
criminal	1
commits	0
a	0
crime	1
or	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
it	0
can	1
if	0
it's	0
done	1
right	1

um	1
i	0
think	1
if	0
they	1
if	0
they	0
started	1
executing	1
them	1
on	0
a	1
regular	1
basis	1
uh	0
that	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
might	1
make	1
a	0
difference	1
right	1
now	1
i	0
don't	1
see	1
it	0
making	0
a	1
difference	1
i	1

if	0
it	0

i	1
don't	1
see	0
someone	1
not	1
going	1
out	1
there	0
and	1
committing	1
murder	1
because	1
they're	1
afraid	1
they're	1
going	1
to	0
get	1
sentenced	1
to	1
death	1
i	0
mean	1
most	1
people	1
out	0
there	0
committing	0
murders	1
like	1
don't	0
care	1

uh-huh	0

they	1
just	1
don't	0
care	1

yeah	0
well	1
i	0
think	1
in	0
large	1
measure	0
the	0
reason	1
they	0
don't	0
care	1
it's	0
not	0
because	0
the	0
punishment	0
but	0
so	0
many	1
of	0
the	0
people	0
that	0
commit	0
crimes	1
don't	1
get	0
punished	1

yeah	0

the	0
police	1
don't	0
catch	1
them	0
or	0
the	0
courts	1
don't	0
convict	1
them	0
or	1
or	0
they	0
don't	1
serve	1
very	0
much	0
of	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
so	0
uh	1
you	0
know	0
their	0
their	0
success	0
rate	0
is	0
very	0
high	1
crime	1
does	0
pay	0
ca[sh]	0
you	0
can	0
make	1
a	0
good	1
living	1
at	1
it	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
and	0
there's	1
uh	0
there's	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	0
here	0
in	1
Baltimore	1
that	0
uh	0
have	1
and	0
we	0
just	0
had	1
uh	0
a	0
real	1
big	1
cocaine	1
bust	1
and	0
of	0
course	1
you	0
know	0
they're	1
they're	0
playing	1
it	1
up	0
real	0
big	1
that	1
it	0
was	0
uh	1
looked	1
like	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
very	1
very	1
small	0
ring	1
and	0
they	0
just	0
happened	1
to	0
get	0
lucky	1
and	0
catch	1
the	0
guy	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	0
mean	1
uh	0
Baltimore	1
has	1
uh	0
an	0
all	0
time	0
record	1
for	0
the	0
number	0
of	0
deaths	1
so	0
far	1
this	0
year	1
i	0
think	0
they've	0
got	0
over	0
a	0
hundred	0
dead	1
already	1
this	0
year	0

last	1
year	0
it	0
was	1
DC	1
i	1
guess	0
Baltimore	1
caught	1
them	0

well	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
it's	1
kind	1
of	1
moved	0
up	1
and	1
you	0
have	1
to	1
remember	1
that	0
it	0
it	0
it	0
uh	0
there's	1
i	0
think	1
X	1
number	0
of	1
people	1
out	0
there	1
that	0
are	1
going	0
to	1
commit	0
murders	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	1
once	0
you	1
kill	0
off	1
a	0
few	1
of	0
them	1

yeah	0

i	0
mean	1
if	1
you	0
murder	1
a	1
guy	1
because	0
he	1
murdered	1
your	1
partner	1
or	1
something	1
like	1
that	1
i	0
mean	1
pretty	1
soon	1
you	1
run	0
out	1
of	1
people	1
to	0
murder	1

yeah	0
the	1
only	1
consolation	1
is	0
so	0
many	1
of	0
the	0
murders	1
are	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
violent	1
people	0
going	0
against	1
each	0
other	1
and	0
so	0
they	0
you	0
know	0
society's	1
not	0
going	0
to	0
put	0
them	0
to	0
death	0
well	0
at	0
least	1
maybe	0
the	1
guy	1
they	0
cross	1
next	0
time	0
is	0
going	1
to	0
uh	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
capital	1
punishment	1
is	0
an	0
appropriate	1
punishment	1
for	1
the	0
kind	1
of	0
people	1
where	0
we	0
say	0
you	0
know	0
this	1
sort	0
of	0
person	1
is	0
just	0
not	1
acceptable	1
to	0
our	0
society	1
and	0
we	0
are	0
there	1
by	1
going	1
to	0
remove	1
them	0
from	0
society	1
not	1
temporarily	1
but	0
permanently	1

yeah	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
i	0
personally	0
think	0
life	0
imprisonment	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
much	1
of	0
li[fe]	0
of	0
life	1
imprisonment	1
first	1
of	0
all	0
it's	0
never	0
turns	0
out	1
to	0
be	0
life	1
but	0
second	0
you	0
know	0
why	0
should	0
we	0
the	0
idea	0
of	0
life	0
imprisonment	0
with	0
no	0
chance	0
of	0
parole	0
well	0
that	1
means	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
put	1
them	0
in	0
a	0
cage	1
you	0
think	0
it's	0
never	1
ever	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
safe	1
for	0
them	0
to	0
walk	1
the	1
streets	0
again	1
well	0
then	1
why	0
bother	0
just	1
execute	1
them	0
because	1
that's	0
that	1
way	0
you're	0
sure	1
they'll	0
never	1
ever	1
going	0
to	1
walk	1
the	0
streets	1
again	1

yeah	0

so	0
any	1
any	1
anybody	1
that	1
says	1
life	1
in	0
prison	1
with	0
no	0
chance	1
of	0
parole	1
i'd	0
say	1
uh	0
give	0
them	0
the	0
death	1
penalty	1
so	0

yeah	0
you	1
know	1
it	0
makes	1
sense	1
um	1
you	1
know	1
you	0
have	1
the	1
occasional	1
person	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
been	0
falsely	1
accused	1
but	0
i	1
mean	0
uh	0
so	1
few	1
and	0
far	1
between	1
uh	1
you	1
know	1
makes	0
good	1
TV	1
movies	1
and	1
that's	1
about	1
it	1

yeah	0
and	0
and	0
also	1
um	0
the	0
the	0
thing	1
i	0
don't	0
like	0
about	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
these	0
court	1
trials	1
and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
these	0
appeals	1
is	0
that	0
it's	0
not	1
based	1
on	1
what	1
is	0
true	1
and	0
what	1
is	0
false	1
but	0
rather	1
it's	0
on	1
the	0
rules	1
of	0
evidence	1
what	1
can	0
i	0
hide	1
and	0
what	1
do	0
i	0
have	1
to	0
tell	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
our	0
courts	1
should	0
be	0
geared	1
much	1
more	0
strongly	1
towards	0
finding	1
out	0
the	0
truth	1
than	0
they	0
currently	1
are	1

yeah	0

and	0
and	1
that	0
way	0
we	0
can	0
be	0
sure	0
you	0
know	0
we	0
can	0
find	1
out	0
the	0
truth	1
we	0
can	1
find	1
out	1
what	0
really	1
happened	1
and	0
and	0
base	1
the	0
ver[dict]	0
sentence	1
on	0
what	1
the	0
person	0
did	1
not	1
on	1
what	1
we're	0
allowed	1
to	0
let	0
the	0
jury	1
hear	1

yeah	0
i	1
had	0
my	1
uh	1
my	0
father-in-law	1
participated	0
in	1
a	1
uh	0
a	1
jury	1
trial	1
he	0
was	0
he	0
was	0
actually	1
on	0
the	0
jury	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	1
this	1
man	1
was	0
accused	1
of	1
killing	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
it	0
was	1
two	1
people	0
uh	1
and	1
shooting	1
a	0
uh	0
policeman	1
um	0
point	1
blank	1
in	1
the	0
face	1
of	1
course	0
he	1
didn't	1
die	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
this	1
was	1
during	1
a	0
holdup	1
of	0
a	1
uh	1
uh	0
a	1
restaurant	1
and	0
it	0
came	1
out	1
during	1
the	0
trial	1
that	1
um	0
they	0
had	0
tried	1
to	0
rob	0
another	1
place	0
and	1
uh	0
when	1
the	1
guy	1
came	0
out	1
with	0
the	0
bag	1
they	1
thought	1
was	1
money	1
it	1
turned	1
out	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
couple	0
cookies	1
and	1
uh	1
you	0
know	1
jumbo	1
cookies	1
and	0
and	0
so	0
they	0
were	0
so	1
upset	1
from	0
robbing	1
this	0
guy	0
you	0
know	0
trying	1
to	0
do	1
this	0
holdup	1
that	0
didn't	1
work	1
that	0
they	0
quite	1
literally	1
were	0
mad	1
and	0
went	1
into	0
a	0
restaurant	1
to	0
hold	0
the	0
place	0
up	1
and	0
just	0
started	1
you	0
know	0
shooting	1
people	0

just	0
started	1
shooting	1
people	0
because	0
they	0
botched	1
the	0
first	1
job	0
and	0

you	0
know	0
it's	0

and	0
so	0
now	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
get	0
even	0

yeah	0

yeah	0
and	0
get	0
even	0
with	0
who	0
i	0
[laughter-mean]	0
you	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
stupid	0
guys	0
and	1
uh	0
it	0
turned	1
out	1
that	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
policeman	1
survived	1
to	0
the	0
point	1
that	0
he	0
was	0
able	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
identify	1
the	0
guy	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
of	0
course	1
you	0
know	0
they	0
tried	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
cop	1
look	0
ou[t]	0
like	0
he	1
was	0
uh	0
a	0
uh	0
no	0
good	0
rotten	1
drunk	1

yeah	0

i	0
mean	0
it	0
was	0
amazing	0

so	0
what	1
was	0
the	0
verdict	1
what	1
was	0
the	0
results	1
there	0

oh	0
he	0
was	0
found	0
guilty	0
yeah	0

oh	0

he	0
uh	0
um	0
last	1
i	0
heard	1
he	1
uh	0
he	1
beat	1
a	0
push	1
for	0
the	0
death	1
penalty	0
now	0
whether	0
they	1
finally	0
got	1
it	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	1
stopped	1
listening	1
after	0
a	0
while	1

uh-huh	0

um	1
you	0
know	0
he	0
would	0
come	0
home	1
and	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
after	1
the	0
trial	1
was	0
over	0
he	0
came	0
home	1
and	0
told	1
us	0
what	1
was	0
going	0
on	1
and	0
of	0
course	1
then	1
they	0
had	0
to	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
dec[ide]	1
you	0
know	1
after	0
he	0
had	0
to	0
go	0

the	0
the	0
penalty	0
phase	0
yeah	0
they've	0
decide	1
the	0
penalty	1
separately	1
from	0
the	0
verdict	1

right	0
and	1
uh	0
yeah	0
everybody	1
everybody	1
was	0
pretty	0
much	1
you	0
know	0
let's	0
burn	1
him	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
that's	0
you	0
know	0
that's	0
the	0
way	1
they	0
wanted	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
and	0
he	1
was	0
surprised	1
because	0
he	0
thought	1
there	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
problem	1
because	0
he	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
some	0
people	1
on	0
the	0
case	1
were	0
were	0
a	0
little	1
hesitant	1
on	0
convicting	1
him	0
on	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
charges	1
but	0
i	0
mean	1
when	0
it	0
all	0
came	0
down	1
they	0
just	0
within	0
an	0
hour	1
decided	1
the	0
man's	1
fate	1

yeah	0
well	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
decide	0
you	0
know	0
wha[t]	0
you	0
well	1
yeah	1
there's	0
really	1
two	0
separate	1
decisions	1
there	0
i	0
guess	1
one	1
is	0
did	0
it	0
really	1
happen	1
the	0
way	1
the	0
the	0
prosecutor	1
said	1
it	0
happened	0
you	0
know	0
is	0
this	0
man	0
really	0
guilty	0
and	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
decide	1
that	1
but	0
then	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
decide	1
you	0
know	1
as	1
a	0
member	1
of	0
society	1
what	1
do	0
i	0
want	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
this	0
guy	0
who	0
did	1
this	0
thing	1

yeah	0

and	0
that	0
w[ill]	0
i	1
i've	0
never	1
been	1
on	0
a	0
jury	0
i've	0
never	1
had	0
that	0
experience	1
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
i'd	0
look	0
forward	1
to	0
making	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
decision	1
about	0
a	0
man's	1
life	1

hm	0
yeah	0
well	0
it	1
it	1
it	0
went	0
pretty	1
pretty	0
quick	1
from	0
what	0
he	0
said	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
i	0
mean	1
there's	1
there's	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
other	0
crimes	1
out	0
there	0
i	0
mean	0
besides	1
murder	1
i	0
think	0
uh	1
now	1
if	0
you're	0
dealing	1
drugs	1
now	0
caught	1
more	0
than	0
twice	1
or	0
something	1
uh	1
it	0
there's	1
uh	0
a	0
death	1
penalty	0
associated	1
with	0
it	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

well	1
the	0
thing	1
i'd	1
be	0
most	0
likely	0
to	0
attach	0
the	0
death	1
penalty	0
to	0
is	0
the	0
violence	1
i	0
mean	0
ye[ah]	0
i	1
can	0
handle	1
people	1
people	1
selling	1
drugs	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0
it's	0
wrong	0
but	1
it	1
it's	0
not	1
worth	0
somebody	1
getting	1
executed	1
for	0
but	1
we	0
hear	1
so	0
much	0
about	0
the	0
violence	1
and	0
how	0
it's	0
not	1
safe	1
to	0
walk	0
the	0
streets	1
because	0
somebody	1
you	0
know	1
these	0
random	1
drive	1
by	0
shootings	1
and	0
that	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
the	0
people	1
i'd	1
most	0
likely	1
want	0
to	0
sentence	1
to	0
death	1
are	0
the	0
people	1
that	0
just	0
show	0
a	0
really	1
low	1
regard	1
for	0
human	0
life	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
never	1
know	1
when	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
turn	1
or	0
hurt	0
the	0
next	0
person	1
because	0
it	0
doesn't	1
really	0
matter	1
to	0
them	0
whether	0
someone	1
else	0
gets	0
hurt	0
or	0
not	1

yeah	0
yeah	0
i	0
agree	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
go	0
le[t's]	0
you	0
know	0
these	1
are	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
people	0
i	0
would	0
like	1
to	0
ye[ah]	0
get	0
out	1
of	0
here	0
and	0
get	0
out	1
of	0
circulation	1
and	0
say	0
i	0
don't	1
we	0
don't	0
accept	1
your	0
kind	1
in	0
our	0
society	1

yeah	0
i	0
agree	0
i	1
i've	1
i	0
have	0
uh	1
a	0
low	0
tolerance	1
for	0
that	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
person	1
and	0
uh	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
there	0
are	1
some	0
some	0
other	1
crimes	1
that	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
kidnapping	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
when	0
they	0
i	0
mean	1
kidnapping	1
per	0
se	1
has	1
a	0
certain	1
uh	0
uh	0
fine	1
and	0
penalty	1
associated	1
with	0
it	0
but	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
um	1
some	1
of	0
these	0
people	1
are	0
just	0
out	1
and	0
out	1
brutal	1
i	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
cases	1
i've	0
heard	1
about	0
over	0
the	0
years	1

okay	1
Eric	1
um	1
are	1
you	1
married	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
family	1

uh	1
yes	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
uh	1
both	1
questions	1

okay	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
wife	1
have	1
a	1
budget	1
plan	1
for	1
your	0
finances	1

uh	1
yeah	1
we	1
do	1
we	0
um	1
uh	0
basically	1
there's	1
the	1
you	1
know	1
expenses	1
that	1
are	1
fixed	1
during	0
the	1
month	1
you	1
know	0
the	1
ones	1
that	1
come	0
every	1
every	0
month	1
and	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
we	1
uh	1
enter	1
those	1
into	1
uh	1
into	1
a	0
spread	1
sheet	1
and	0
uh	0
what's	0
ever	1
left	1
uh	0
after	0
that	1
we	1
you	1
know	1
we	1
we	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
agree	1
on	1
kind	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
sort	1
of	0
range	1
we're	1
gonna	1
generally	1
gonna	1
shoot	1
for	1

uh-huh	1

okay	1
um	0
well	0

so	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
do	1

well	0
that's	1
basically	0
what	0
we	0
do	1
um	0
about	1
every	1
every	0
three	0
months	1
or	0
so	1
we	0
reevaluate	1
our	0
budget	1
and	0
we	1
sit	0
down	1
and	0
just	0
write	1
from	0
the	0
largest	1
bills	0
down	0
to	1
the	0
smallest	1

um-hum	1

and	1
then	1
we	0
divvy	1
them	0
up	1
between	1
our	0
four	0
pay	1
checks	0
i	1
work	1
part	1
time	1
at	0
night	1

[laughter-wow]	1

and	1
he	1
works	1
and	1
my	1
husband	1
works	1
full	1
time	0
days	1
and	0
so	0
we	1
have	0
the	0
four	1
pay	0
checks	0
with	0
that	0
works	1
out	0
nice	0
because	0
we	0
get	0
paid	1
every	0
week	1
and	1
so	0
that	1
does	0
help	1

yeah	0

that	1
helps	0
a	0
lot	1
and	0
then	1
um	0
we	1
don't	0
have	0
a	0
lot	1
ex[tra]	0
extra	1
for	1
extra	1
spending	1
so	1

so	1
it's	1
pretty	1
well	1
earmarked	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
all	1
allocated	1
out	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
ev[ery]	0
every	1
penny	1
is	1
earmarked	1
but	1
um	1
it	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
that	1
works	1
the	0
best	1
and	0
and	0
so	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
just	0
divide	1
them	1
up	0
all	1
the	1
major	1
bills	0
up	0
in	0
fact	1
we	0
found	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
divide	0
the	0
major	1
bills	0
up	1
you	1
know	0
cut	1
the	0
house	1
payment	0
in	0
half	1
and	0
cut	1
the	1
loan	1
payment	1
in	0
half	1
and	0
and	1
divide	1
those	1
up	1
between	1
all	1
um-hum	0

all	1
the	0
checks	1
yeah	1

and	0
so	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
taking	0
a	0
huge	1
sum	1
out	0
out	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
next	1
pay	0
check	0
we're	1
real	1
short	1
or	1

right	1
yeah	1
we	1
found	0
that	0
um	0
it's	1
definitely	1
helped	0
uh	1
get	1
a	1
handle	1
on	1
kind	1
of	1
the	0
unnecessary	1
expenses	1

that's	1
true	1

we	1
were	0
before	1
we	1
started	1
doing	1
that	1
kind	1
of	0
a	1
thing	1
we	1
were	1
um	1
spending	1
uh	0
money	1
for	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
know	1
we	0
probably	1
tended	0
to	0
eat	1
out	1
a	0
bit	1
more	1
than	0
the	0
than	1
we	0
should	1
have	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
was	1
easy	1
to	1
uh	1
let	1
things	0
get	0
out	1
of	1
hand	1
we	1
thought	1
it	1
uh	1
thought	1
it	1
to	0
be	0
really	0
helpful	1
we've	0
gotten	1
some	1
of	0
our	0
loans	1
paid	0
off	0
early	1
because	1
of	0
this	1
and	1
and	0
stuff	1
like	1
that	1
so	1

yeah	0

so	1

well	1
it	0
helps	1
you	0
to	0
focus	1
where	1
your	0
money	0
goes	1

yeah	1

and	1
and	0
i'm	0
sure	1
you	1
felt	0
the	0
s[ame]	0
the	0
same	1
frustration	1
before	1
you	0
got	1
on	0
a	0
budget	1
but	0
you're	0
wondering	1
my	0
when	0
you	0
put	1
down	0
all	1
the	0
money	0
that	0
you	0
do	1
bring	0
in	0
and	1
then	0
you're	1
saying	1
my	1
word	1
where	0
did	1
all	1
that	1
money	1
go	1

that's	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
money	1
but	0

where	1
does	1
it	1
go	1

yeah	0

huh	0

and	0
also	1
we	1
have	0
found	1
that	0
if	1
we	1
write	1
down	1
a[nd]	0
and	0
we	1
did	1
this	1
we're	1
not	0
real	1
consistent	1
with	0
this	0
but	0
we	0
did	1
it	0
for	0
about	0
a	0
month	1
and	0
we	1
wrote	0
down	1
everything	1
that	0
we	1
bought	1
with	0
you	1
know	1
every	0
paycheck	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	0
we	1
could	0
see	1
where	0
every	1
penny	1
went	1
and	1
it	1
was	0
really	0
interesting	1
to	0
see	1
just	1
what	0
you	0
do	1
spend	0
and	0
and	1
like	0
i	0
say	1
we	0
haven't	1
been	0
real	0
consistent	1
with	1
it	1
it's	0
we	0
should	1
because_1	1
it	0
does	1
help	1

yeah	1
the	0
other	1
the	0
other	1
thing	1
that	0
that	0
we've	1
found	1
that	0
that	0
helps	1
if	1
you	1
know	1
we	0
tend	1
to	0
fudge	1
on	0
the	0
budget	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
it's	1

uh-huh	0

it's	1
just	0
to	1
[laughter-uh]	1
uh	1
get	0
out	1
the	1
money	1
in	0
advance	1
and	0
put	0
it	0
in	1
uh	0
um	1
so	0
long	1
as	0
it	0
wasn't	1
you	1
know	1
unreasonably	1
high	1
but	1
for	1
things	1
like	1
food	1
expenses	1
or	1
or	1
whatever	1
just	1
put	1
it	0
in	0
a	0
in	0
an	1
envelope	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
that	1
way	1
it	0
kind	0
of	0
forced	1
us	0
to	0
uh	0
stick	1
to	0
that	0
amount	1
and	0
then	0
once	1
that	0
was	0
gone	1
well	1
if	0
the	0
entertainment	1
amount	0
was	0
gone	1
for	0
the	0
month	1
oh	0
it's	0
gone	1

just	1
stick	1
to	0
that	1
uh-huh	0
that	0
is	1

yeah	0
that	0
that	1
sounds	1
like	0
a	1
really	1
good	0
idea	1

so	1

and	0
it	0
really	1
helpful	1
um	1
have	1
you	0
developed	1
a	0
savings	1
plan	1
or	0
IRAs	1
or	0
anything	1
like	0
that	1
yet	1

we	1
we	1
haven't	0
we	0
our	0
our	0
initial	1
goal	0
was	0
just	0
to	0
retire	1
our	0
debt	1
uh	0
completely	1
retire	0
our	0
debt	1
for	0
car	1
payments	1
and	1
credit	1
card	1
uh	1
credit	1
card	1
debt	1
and	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
that	1
and	1

oh	0
uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
we're	1
just	0
at	0
a	1
point	1
where	0
where	0
we	1
could	0
start	0
thinking	1
about	0
it	0
so	0

oh	0
that's	1
good	1
that's	1
a	0
good	0
feeling	1

yeah	1
i	0

my	0
husband	1
just	1
graduated	1
from	0
the	1
university	1
uh	0
a	1
year	1
ago	1

um-hum	0

so	0
finally	1
finally	1
we	0
are	1
getting	1
to	1
that	0
point	0
too	1

a	0
study	1

so	1
are	0
you	1
still	0
going	0
to	0
school	0
or	1

yeah	0
yeah	1
i'm	0
actually	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
mas[ter]	1

well	1
i	1
guess	1
we're	1
uh	1
forced	1
to	1
finally	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
lot	1
about	1
air	1
pollution	1
i	1
hear	1
that	1
the	1
major	1
automobile	1
manufacturers	1
are	1
looking	1
at	1
nonpolluting	1
cars	1
and	1
low	1
polluting	1
f[uels]	0
fuels	1
are	1
being	1
experimented	1
with	1
ethanol	1
and	1
other	1
types	1
of	0
fuels	1

yeah	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
they	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
was	1
where	1
you	1
thought	1
the	1
major	1
source	1
was	1
coming	1
from	1
or	1
sources	1

i	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
assume	1
that	1
the	0
major	1
sources	1
are	0
cars	1
and	0
factories	1
but	0

that's	1
what	1
i	0
would	1
think	1

but	0
i	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
for	1
sure	1
i	1

i	1
just	1
know	1
that	1
um	1
acid	1
rain	1
apparently	1
is	1
a	0
big	1
problem	1
in	0
Canada	1
from	1
what	0
comes	1
over	0
the	0
border	1
from	0
us	1

right	1
yeah	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
automobile	1
definitely	1
is	1
an	0
area	1
uh	1
any	0
any	1
industry	1
that	0
burns	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
then	0
i	1
don't	1
know	1
about	1
chemical	1
pollution	1
i'm	1
not	1
real	1
into	1
that	1
as	1
far	0
as	1
how	1
it	0
affects	0
the	1
air	1
i	1
know	0
we	1
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
chemical	1
the	1
indoor	1
type	0
pollution	1
they	0
have	0
offices	1
that	1
are	0
too	1
well	1
insulated	1
they	1
found	1
people	1
are	1
getting	1
sick	1

yeah	1

but	0
i	1
don't	1
know	1
if	1
that	1
affects	0
outside	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
seems	1
to	1
think	1
seems	0
to	0
me	0
that's	1
what	1
they	0
were	1
asking	1
about	1
was	1
outside	1
and	1
the	0
thing	1
i	1
can	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
i	1
can	1
think	1
of	1
would	1
be	0
cars	1
and	1
factories	1

yeah	1
the	1
smokestacks	1
or	1
the	0
exhaust	1
pipes	1

yeah	1

um	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	1
been	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
pressure	1
to	1
um	1
do	0
away	1
with	0
the	0
CFCs	1
in	1
these	1
spray	1
bottles	1
which	0
has	1
been	1
a	0
real	1
problem	1

right	1

yeah	1
that	1
is	1
well	1
that's	1
destroying	1
the	1
ozone	1
isn't	1
it	1

again	1
i	1
that's	1
what	1
i	1
hear	1
and	1
and	1
there's	1
this	1
big	1
debate	1
apparently	1
about	0
whether	1
the	1
ozone	1
there's	1
a	0
hole	1
in	0
the	1
ozone	0
or	1
not	1
but	1
at	0
last	1
i	1
heard	1
it	1
was	0
uh	1
discovered	1
that	0
the	1
hole	1
was	1
bigger	1
than	1
they	0
thought	1
initially	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
that's	1
it	0
it's	1

it's	1
kind	1
of	0
scary	1

well	1
it	0
is	1
scary	0
and	1
i	1
think	1
it	0
will	1
uh	1
continue	1
to	1
force	1
us	1
to	1
clean	1
up	1
our	1
act	1
literally	1
and	0
figuratively	1

yeah	0

we've	0
got	1
to	1
learn	1
to	0
manage	1
without	1
destroying	1
the	1
environment	1

i	0
think	1
something	0
too	1
that	1
you	1
probably	1
see	1
in	1
older	1
states	1
all	0
we	0
we	1
do	0
it	0
down	0
here	1
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
we	0
will	1
have	0
a	0
cold	1
spell	0
is	0
where	0
people	1
will	0
use	1
their	1
fireplaces	1

i	1
i	0
i'm	1
wondering	1
whether	1
it's	1
going	0
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	0
point	1
where	1
you	0
can't	1
do	1
that	1

i	1
think	1
it	0
will	1

in	0
Los	0
Angeles	1
they're	1
apparently	1
going	1
to	0
they've	1
passed	1
laws	1
that	1
for	1
habit	1
for	0
example	1
people	0
using	1
uh	0
barbecues	1
gasoline	1
lawn	1
mowers	1
um	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
it's	0
really	1
bad	1
in	0
places	1
like	0
Los	0
Angeles	1
and	0
it's	0
gotten	1
bad	1
in	0
Denver	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
and	1
uh	1
it's	0
not	1
too	1
bad	0
around	0
here	1
although	0
you	0
see	1
it	1
you	0
know	1
more	1
and	0
more	1
in	1
the	0
sky	1
and	1
people	1
in	0
this	0
country	1
are	1
really	1
wedded	1
to	1
their	1
uh	1
cars	1
and	1

right	1

and	1
our	1
economy	1
seems	1
to	1
and	0
this	1
i	1
think	1
is	1
one	0
of	1
the	1
big	1
problems	1

yeah	1
in	0
this	1
area	0
too	1
since	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
Texas	1
we're	0
so	0
spread	0
out	1
we	0

yeah	1

we	0
have	0
to	0
drive	0
so	0
far	1
but	0
i	0
know	1
in	1
Colorado	1
i	1
have	0
witnessed	1
that	1
where	0
it	0
just	1
uh	1
it	0
just	0
stacks	1
up	1
at	0
the	0
when	1
the	1
Rockies	1
starts	1
but	0
we're	1
even	0
getting	0
it	0
here	1
we	0
can	0
drive	1
into	0
when	0
we've	0
been	1
on	0
vacation	1
or	0
something	0
drive	1
into	0
Fort	1
Worth	0
or	0
Dallas	1
and	1
you	1
can	0
tell	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
mornings	1
too	1
my	0
husband	1
likes	0
to	1
go	1
out	0
and	0
jog	1
and	0
there's	1
just	1
a	0
brown	1
fog	1
here	1
and	0
we	1
don't	1
even	0
have	1
any	0
mountains	1
that	1
are	0
holding	1
it	0
in	1

yeah	1

but	1
they	0
also	1
said	0
that	0
more	1
dense	1
the	0
population	1
and	0
the	0
more	1
we	0
crowd	1
together	1
the	0
worse	1
it	0
gets	1

well	0
that	1
makes	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
sense	1
i	0
mean	1
i	0
i	1
hadn't	0
thought	1
about	0
it	0
that	1
way	0
but	0
it	0
it	1

you	0
don't	1
have	0
to	0
have	0
mountains	1
there	0
stopping	1
it	0

yeah	1

and	1
uh	1
they	0
make	0
uh	1
making	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
high-rise	1
buildings	1
and	0
uh	0
so	0
yeah	1
we	0
can	0
comment	1
and	0
we	1
didn't	0
see	1
this	0
a	0
few	1
years	1
ago	0

no	1
and	0
i	0
think	1

it	0
was	0
pretty	0
clear	1
here	0

yeah	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
that	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
it's	0
becoming	0
apparent	1
to	1
people	0
that	0
the	0
earth	1
which	0
includes	0
all	1
the	0
people	1
on	1
it	0
and	0
everything	0
that's	0
going	0
on	1
it	0
is	0
a	0
is	0
an	0
organism	1
of	0
sorts	1
and	0
that	0
there	1
is	0
a	1
uh	0
a	0
whole	1
set	1
of	1
organic	1
relationships	1
that	0
if	0
we	1
start	1
to	0
destroy	1
one	0
part	1
of	0
it	0
it's	0
going	1
to	0
tell	1
us	0
about	0
it	1
and	1

right	1

and	1
uh	0
we're	1
going	0
to	1
feel	1
it	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	1
going	1
to	0
be	0
real	1
interesting	1
and	1
particularly	1
in	1
light	1
of	0
what	0
is	0
obviously	1
going	0
to	1
be	1
a	0
big	1
structural	1
change	0
in	0
the	0
economy	1
uh	1
in	1
this	0
country	1
uh	0
whether	0
people	1
are	1
willing	0
to	1
get	0
out	0
of	1
their	0
cars	1
and	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

and	1
i[n]	1
in	0
this	0
country	1
uh	0
the	0
the	0
solution	1
that	0
that	0
people	1
seem	0
to	1
think	0
work	1
are	0
politically	0
unacceptable	1
for	0
example	1
taxing	1
people	0
heavily	1
for	0
using	1
their	0
cars	1

yeah	1

and	0
uh	1
i'm	0
i	1
have	1
a	0
little	0
sports	1
car	0
that	0
i	1
enjoy	0
using	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
just	1
like	0
anybody	0
else	1
how	0
much	0
fun	1
it	0
is	0
to	1
drive	1
but	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
we're	0
gonna	0
have	1
to	0
make	0
some	0
fundamental	1
changes	1
and	0
and	0
i'm	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
how	0
long	1
it's	0
gonna	0
take	1
or	0
what	1
it's	0
gonna	0
take	0
because	0
they	0
keep	0
saying	1
that	0
the	0
economy	1
is	0
gonna	0
depend	1
on	0
how	1
many	0
cars	1
and	0
houses	1
we	0
sell	1

yes	1

and	1
it's	0
a	0
shame	1
too	1
when	1
you	0
do	1
see	1
somebody	1
driving	1
a	0
big	1
car	1
just	0
one	1
person	1
in	0
that	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
waste	1
but	0

where	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
most	1
of	1
your	1
news	1

i	1
watch	1
the	1
MacNeil	1
Lehrer	1
news	1
hour	1
and	1
i	1
subscribe	1
to	1
the	1
paper	1

weekends	1

news	1
from	0
a	1
combination	1
of	0
sources	1

the	1
paper	1
everyday	1

and	1

and	1
i	0
read	1

the	1
way	0
in	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
the	0
in	1
a	1
carpool	1

oh	0
really	1

uh-huh	1
and	1
uh	1
and	1
i	1
watch	1
the	1
uh	1
actually	1
i	1
watch	1
the	1
morning	1
news	1
before	0
i	1
leave	0
for	1
work	0

and	1
then	1
you	0
know	0
usually	1
over	0
lunch	1
there'll	0
be	0
a	1
big	1
topic	1
of	0
conversation	1
on	1
something	1
from	1
the	1
news	1

um-hum	1
i	1
normally	1
find	1
that	1
uh	0
i	1
i'm	0
probably	1
the	1
most	1
um	1
news	1
hungry	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
so	1
i	1
don't	1
we	0
don't	0
normally	0
talk	1
about	0
the	0
news	1
at	0
lunch	0

i	1
i	1
find	1
that	0
i	0
have	1
to	0
only	1
subscribe	0
to	1
the	1
paper	1
on	1
the	0
weekend	1
simply	0
because	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
during	1
the	0
week	1

but	0

but	0
um	0
i	1
would	0
always	1
end	0
up	1
arriving	1
at	0
work	1
late	1
because	0
i	1
would	1
always	0
end	0
up	1
skimming	1
the	1
headlines	1
spending	0
too	1
much	1
time	1
reading	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1

yeah	1

so	1
i	0
have	1
to	1
cut	1
myself	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
weekend	1
plus	1
after	1
work	1

um	0
the	1
MacNeil	1
Lehrer	0
news	1
hour	1
is	1
on	1
uh	1
public	1
television	1

and	1

and	1
i	1
enjoy	1
that	1
quite	1
a	1
bit	1

yeah	0

um	0
one	1
of	0
the	1
women	1
that	0
i	0
work	1
with	0
her	1
husband	1
is	0
Iranian	1

so	1

so	1
here	1
lately	1
with	0
all	0
the	0
Middle	0
Eastern	0
news	1
we've	0
had	0
some	0
very	1
interesting	0
conversations	1
over	0
lunch	1

i	1
will	1
admit	0
i	1
work	1
with	1
uh	0
someone	1
who's	0
Iranian	1

and	1
he	1
definitely	0
has	0
a	1
very	1
different	1
slant	1
on	1
the	0
news	0
he's	1

he's	1
very	1
very	1
skeptical	1
of	0
the	0
news	1
media	0
and	1
i	1
will	0
admit	1
i'm	1
reasonably	1
skeptical	1
also	1
but	0
he's	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
uh	1
he's	1
mu[ch]	0
much	1
much	1
more	1
so	0
it's	1
it's	0
sort	1
of	0
interesting	1
though	0
because	1
he	0
does	1
bring	0
a	0
a	1
much	1
um	0
different	1
perspective	0
with	0
all	1
the	0
Gulf	1
goings	1
on	0
um	0
he	0
was	1
always	0
speaking	1
in	1
terms	1
of	0
you	0
know	0
American	0
imperialism	1
reasserting	1
itself	0
and	0

and	0
i	0
suppose	1
it's	0
a	0
different	1
attitude	1
that	0
we	0
normally	0
don't	0
hear	1
in	0
the	0
country	0

um-hum	0

well	0
i	1
i	1
uh	0
i	1
like	0
the	1
print	1
news	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
the	0
television	1
news	1
because	0
television	1
news	0
tends	1
to	1
sensationalize	1

um-hum	0
true	1
um	0

the	0

i	1
understand	1
that	0
the	1
MacNeil	0
Lehrer	1
probably	0
doesn't	1

they	1
um	0
tend	1
to	1
spend	1
quite	1
a	0
bit	1
of	0
time	1
on	1
one	0
story	1
