you know UNK UNK		
so when i went to my first year of tech school		
and the UNK that i get the UNK that it gets		
and the UNK is is that great		
i think it it going to		
UNK planted uh already UNK		
he he not really into all that		
i can see some lady		
money spent there		
well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new UNK		
is it		
you want to start		
but there is no place to		
by two things		
that you know it was great		
and here here what wrong		
coming down on him because of		
where i went to take them1		
and then UNK off all the UNK		
oh i do do know maybe an UNK theme or		
that that what		
you know in a lot of cases		
uh how do you feel about it		
i could easily envision that		
you know the		
is where they started getting into so much		
i think for a dinner party		
and that was probably one of the most UNK things i had gotten into in a long time		
programs that involve the government		
they uh		
it it state UNK		
three weeks short		
UNK you can make a good living at it		
and we are there by going to remove them from society		
it was just i just wish that there was something else		
that that huge		
no UNK UNK affection from the		
what would you start UNK UNK		
theyre theyre a lot more UNK		
there is		
uh we ca ca even find a place to shoot		
that i do do have any first hand UNK about		
and there there a lot of crime there		
but you come to a place like UNK		
room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it		
our education budget will go down if this is	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
like where i work it it it it pretty casual um	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
i do do know all that	1 0 0 1 1 0	0 1 0 0 0 1
i do do know	0 0 0 0	0 1 0 0
i do do even remember this being on there	1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i agree	0 1	0 0
like if they did have a big brother big sister program	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

twelve miles or so	1 1 0 0	0 0 0 1
uh UNK	1 0	1 0
i know the day care UNK are not cheap either	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
and they dress up like when UNK are coming in	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and they had like just UNK it back together	1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
it it usually that power UNK belt or something that that	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1

id id like to have my gun	0 0 0 0 0 0 1	0 0 0 1 0 1 0

that you ca ca you ca ca remove the jury regardless of the case	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got UNK was uh		
it UNK		
can get their degree		
coming up and everything		
it it got a hell of a kick to it		
but i mean uh baltimore has uh an all time UNK for the number of UNK		
just to think about doing it		
UNK or or UNK UNK or whatever		
and uh for an out of state student the UNK went up twenty per cent		
you know with		
i- i do do know what amount of what amount of our UNK would stop some UNK i guess from doing anything uh that would be UNK		
the subsidy itself		
you know some people on the case were		
oh what what that		
ive ive got an an UNK UNK that		
uh high school		
uh UNK		
um UNK is concerned		
im im im im sure there there a lot of um		
uh UNK for just about everything		
because it seems that there		
i did some UNK years ago		
and and that way we can be sure you know		
did did did did have one for a whole year		
did things so bad		
UNK over two or three UNK in the cloth		
and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt		
where you you turn it		
and i could could figure what was going on half the time		
it was a lot of fun		
that in the last ten years		
and um well i work all week		
i should		
and some of the		
im im not a people person		
that that been about ten years ago right		
and they		
would that be uh		
and i do do want to UNK it because that would start breaking down the UNK and so forth		
and then when everything everything set up then you look for		
you know down in north carolina there was a big UNK for a while because1 the uh the local UNK of the UNK UNK UNK wanted to uh		
but that will be it		
before that i really did did pay any attention at all		
is it takes extra money from		
as far as my defense	1 1 0 1 0	1 0 1 0 0
that that	0 0	1 0
but we would would UNK our UNK or UNK shotgun	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
oh um have you seen the UNK must be crazy part two	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
and you vote for the democrats	1 1 1 0 0 0	0 1 0 0 1 1
that they have all these after school activities for kids	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
it was a short van	0 0 0 0 0	0 0 0 0 0
it was miles down the road	1 0 1 0 1 0	1 1 1 1 0 1
and the things that are important to you	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
and you know it it	0 1 0 0 0	1 0 0 0 0
or UNK	1 0	0 0
well i did for many years	1 0 1 1 1 1	0 0 1 1 1 0
it it it not worth	1 0 0 0 0	0 0 0 1 0
give me a break	0 0 1 1	0 1 1 1
you know a lot of people like	1 0 0 0 0 0 0	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
and it does does become fun anymore	0 0 1 1 0 1 0	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
talking about	0 1	0 0
uh i im im just getting UNK again now hearing the UNK come up that there has to be increased UNK in that area	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but uh i was just talking to somebody else	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	1 0 1 0 1 1 0
ill ill let you go first		
oh yeah

UNK or whatever		
because as far as housework goes		
one where		
well it it an UNK um		
a UNK UNK as they were		
and UNK		
um is a dutch iris		
yeah is um		
i liked my job really well		
and uh		
that she can imagine UNK married		
is is		
i sort of		
uh uh with the with the great UNK expenditure of UNK and time there		
so i do do		
that was even harder		
that does does do me any good because i do do have any place to burn it		
and uh		
it used to be UNK you know		
and that that you know that that the way they wanted to do it		
it is not a perennial		
now i do do i hardly ever watch tv tv		
oh yes		
UNK i guess as being half my age so that by UNK that means theyre theyre young uh		
shell them1 or at least		
and that that one of them		
previous UNK of uh		
i just		
but you know it was a lot of fun too		
level UNK they UNK their UNK		
now my daughter		
it came out right around the time with UNK UNK		
that was a couple UNK ago		
i mean i wasted a year and a half of UNK hard		
i mean it burned out		
and and		
im im im im doing a lot more cooking now		
and that kind of UNK from getting a lot of issues UNK		
i do not have a real big front yard		
for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine		
that that right		
but why		
you definitely do do have UNK	0 0 0 0 0 0	0 1 1 0 0 0
UNK UNK UNK to home	0 1 0 0 0	0 0 0 1 1
and uh ive ive seen uh a lot of people	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
if id id of had that many id id of had to work	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh boy	0 1	0 0
i i needed to	0 1 0 0	1 1 1 0
well see i do do know anything about politics	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i do crochet and a lot of uh	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and you have to decide that	0 1 0 0 0 1	0 1 0 1 1 1
you did did get any government classes	1 0 0 1 1 0 0	0 0 0 1 1 0 0
but a lot of families do that	0 1 0 1 1 1 0	1 1 0 1 0 1 1
it it got a great big piece of UNK and a great big piece of UNK	1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
the UNK UNK all UNK in	0 0 0 1 0 0	1 0 0 0 0 0
big deal	0 0	1 0
oh no	1 1	0 0
UNK you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
it seems like we are doing it here UNK	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
theyre theyre kind of like	0 1 0 0 1	0 1 0 0 1
so im im going to have	1 0 0 0 1 0	0 0 1 0 0 1
so you are a disgruntled UNK student	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	1 1 1 1 1 1 1
well a lot of it can be UNK to the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1	0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
wanted the right to do that	1 1 1 0 0 0	1 0 0 0 0 0
now when i graduated high school	1 0 0 1 0 1	0 0 0 0 0 0
getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
first of all it it never UNK out to be life		
just like now you know there there		
things like UNK		
they went from eleven to fifteen hundred		
so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here		
but i- i rather imagine there there		
they should pay for it with their life		
the trash as they put it out		
but that that		
i do too uh because laughter-it does does make any difference uh		
i would be far better off being in the paralegal field		
it may have been UNK		
the subject is is big city crime which is something		
if it it		
UNK of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i UNK to someone		
a lot of it depends upon the major		
somebody want do that-		
uh UNK		
to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine UNK		
the three fifty regular gas engine		
the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with		
UNK you know		
that that		
well there there a four year colleges		
i i do do know where you start or		
that that funny		
to come in and live with them1		
i did forget to UNK you		
but second		
both UNK UNK UNK and also		
i think that uh the		
i really like doing stuff like that		
over in ti ti mean for ti ti but over in italy		
or at least for the last twenty years or so ive ive felt that the UNK of our taxes into high		
i did not know the UNK hyacinths were going to die		
but i i i would would trade the experience for anything in the world		
were a little UNK on		
you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on		
well public school all the way up UNK all the way up to uh		
and we had her for six years until she just passed away		
is probably robberies house robberies	0 0 0 0 0	0 0 1 1 0
im im not old	0 1 0 0	0 0 1 0
i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone someone life and like you say it it it it there there no doubt whatsoever	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
and really it it	1 1 1 0	0 0 0 0
theyll theyll theyll theyll UNK your house and uh	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
what did you think about that idea	0 0 0 0 1 0 1	1 1 1 0 0 1 0
they kept boring that block out to where	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i do do know how many UNK feet it is a big UNK UNK	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
cocoa did did think too much of it though	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
that that the thing	0 1 0 1	0 1 0 0
based on fact	1 0 0	1 0 1
you know	0 0	0 1
you know	0 0	1 1
uh get one at at UNK	0 0 0 1 0 0	0 0 0 0 1 0
i do do do it quite as much as i used to	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
i have have	0 1 0	0 0 1
he he he he just about a year old himself and never had really		
i do do know		
um id i think it it it it UNK		
i- i do not much care for them		
when i came down		
or something		
and uh what i usually do on the weekend is is lay out five UNK		
takes two weeks for that system to process		
what do you believe in		
if you had if you were a teacher		
is this the first year they have been up		
see uh my husband has a thing		
like it was UNK around the		
how and then		
theyre theyre theyre theyre youre youre most likely to do better in school		
and that that why it was so cheap UNK it it not it it not really UNK		
pretty much UNK people		
decent professional UNK who probably would UNK paying		
i wanted i want to go see that		
that that was an area that i- i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that were were UNK for		
id id rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence		
in the UNK in the presidential race		
really independent		
that that what i keep UNK this UNK		
do anything um like uh not identify yourself to the government		
that says on the UNK i can get ten cents but not in texas		
and a lot of the usually UNK		
you can pick it up UNK UNK		
that the UNK		
and she said there there a lot of UNK in that name said my UNK lived UNK years		
theyve theyve had it		
it all came down they just		
and they had a little uh theater company		
oh okay		
you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and uh and car theft on top of it UNK my car		
because sometimes the UNK you just ca ca go by		
see it it all it it all money		
i think UNK UNK got it		
there there a lot of them1 um		
i do do think that there there enough being done		
education i think is a lot of it		
the whole		
corpus christi texas which has the		
uh so that way that kind of UNK you to UNK		
so i can just wear whatever i have on for school		
um originally i had planned		
what did you think of reagan as a president		
when the thing has has won any UNK	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
probably some of them did	1 0 0 0 0	1 0 0 1 0
the only field im im not familiar with really is education which is UNK as	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0

and um	0 1	1 0
you talk	0	0
now the		
you take care		
because1 the porch is pretty big		
except that UNK them they would probably do something		
thought within the community		
the puppy jumped in the		
and there there not enough money to spread around		
and and i have i have no problem		
probably uh		
well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young		
and i know		
around here		
so they		
think that that happened in a lot of cases		
and so it was		
oh okay		
and that is uh and		
UNK UNK a nuclear UNK you know		
ill ill tell you		
ill i UNK everybody else will start doing that UNK or UNK		
and- you know		
theyre theyre from places like up in UNK and UNK		
uh unemployment		
something else i think we can do is support companies that UNK		
you know just a technician		
they are just pretty		
but i guess UNK because i guess im im not UNK with what		
i i guess there there just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it		
course i i know you ca ca be a hundred percent UNK		
you can make it either tight		
and but then they lost too much business		
UNK or or		
the thing		
you know		
oh i do do know		
and uh the		
theyll theyll make a UNK		
even it out since we UNK to be UNK doing all the cooking and they were doing all the UNK		
the argument		
ive ive never UNK to		
they rate		
and there are a few in some of the more		
and after a year and a half of that i decided i did did want that either		
the democrats were the UNK		
and im im just i guess im im just middle america or something	1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
so what what the UNK	0 1 0 1 0	0 1 1 1 1
but she she uh she she that sort of UNK UNK UNK color you know	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
UNK actually i think that	1 1 0 0 1	0 0 0 0 0
is he going to be a UNK a good UNK	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
and uh here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
that that okay	1 0 0	1 0 1

well anyway im im sorry i did did i did did have	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
i UNK there there there there over UNK problems	0 0 0 0 0	0 1 0 0 0
you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community		
does does really feel like youre youre in the country		
a single		
small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be UNK within themselves		
the police do do catch them		
there there several of them that are out right now that i want to see		
and it and it looks quite formal		
because1 if if theyre theyre dead for too long		
i went to a UNK school		
the vietnam war		
ive ive got a UNK UNK		
and then people like well		
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i- i make a UNK amount of money		
we can find out the truth		
but uh		
is it registered		
theyre theyre theyre theyre convicting them UNK than theyre theyre		
nine UNK		
because1 i just watch them over and over again		
that that funny		
she she twenty years old		
would have been wrong with this dog		
i do do think that they could be UNK in every case every time		
but i mean		
i mean everybody everybody got to do it		
i was in the air force		
but i have no idea where they are		
they have		
what- what is the name of that		
and it gives it a bit of a different UNK		
was funded sixty		
well youre youre not a UNK year old		
usually i think it it		
and i and i imagine it it it		
is that what		
well see the other way im im thinking about is they should be UNK like		
UNK school areas		
and i		
ever seasoning just light		
why it was it was so cheap		
it it pretty much funded well		
so i do do repeat an outfit		
UNK UNK		
you get one		
a UNK UNK shop		
im im not trying to see the government put out any more		
and everything everything nice and clean		
on having dinner parties		
UNK UNK type		
it it just really hard		
uh quite a bit more taxes

and if it it possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people		
true person anyway		
i can handle		
just as far as being a		
sell UNK UNK as much as we bring in		
you bet		
had to go in after her		
oh the UNK		
ive ive had a terrible day		
oh yeah		
so they just about complicated the things so much that		
rather than having someone		
well um you- you UNK your daughter had graduated from college		
i do do know		
you know skirts and		
now we		
i do do know much- that much about it		
no that that right		
i i personally think life imprisonment		
she had a dispute black girl		
UNK UNK mechanics ca ca do much with them		
but still it it you know it it really not		
i i i think		
sold as purple buddy or sometimes sold as UNK flower		
or like when uh UNK		
oh yeah		
but i do do know um		
they UNK most of them1 as professionals		
and i thought oh UNK		
i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing		
now this one was UNK		
and they		
but it it rather		
if him and his wife were were getting along		
UNK UNK UNK part twenty		
ive ive seen some		
that that true		
and my child is going to		
what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on UNK		
i do do know		
you pay		
i do do know how you combat that		
UNK UNK and couple of other things im im sure	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans	0	0
little tiny things and just almost UNK to do anything with		
sort of crime
