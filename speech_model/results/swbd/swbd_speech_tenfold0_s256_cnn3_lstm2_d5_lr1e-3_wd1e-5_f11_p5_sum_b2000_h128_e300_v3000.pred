started going together	6 6 6	6 6 6

i do do do it quite as much as i used to	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
but it it it	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
i mean from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand	6 6 6 2 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 3 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4
laughter-oh laughter-my laughter-word	6 6 6	6 6 6

and it it going to have little shopping centers in it and little	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4
but i did not know that these hyacinths	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
ibm ibm ibm uh	2 4 4 6	3 6 6 6
have you heard stuff about him lately	6 3 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and have them go through it from top to bottom	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
some of these saturday night specials that these companies put out that are a	7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6
but it it still in great shape	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
they did have good bargains	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
and things are quite different there in terms of that	6 2 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
because1 you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure theyre theyre complete	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6
we need to cut back that that what we do	2 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
so you know were were were were thinking about that	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i thought it was interesting that recently here the warsaw pact no longer exists as a militorymilitary military force	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i thought he was great	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
la la raiders	3 1 1	3 1 6
so there has been some flooding	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
you just ca ca believe all the things he he done	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and i one of the problems with the lotus database database was	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
irrigation because it it gotten so bad the past few years	2 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but anyway	6 6	6 6
knowing them theyre theyre very um	6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
even if you care like i do to do much	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 7	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4
well then then again when you have uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i just it never crosses my mind	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre just so outrageously priced	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 4
get together	6 6	6 6
in the private sector i would think	6 7 5 5 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but the ribbons	6 3 1	6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
just because it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does	2 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
they have on tv tv	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
it does does help them1 any at all	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
i bought me	6 6 6	6 6 6
they could very easily	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and uh but if	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well it goes all through the	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and itll itll be something my kids will have you know	6 3 1 6 3 1 1 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the district of columbia at washington	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
you ca ca get it to run the right the right way either	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 6 6
i do not know what it really will take	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i find though that if when i find an author	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
you know purely metric system down there	6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6
and uh i liked those two movies of his a lot	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
uh it	6 6	6 6
but theyre theyre not speaking for me	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6

you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
at a	6 6	6 6
believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise we need to take care of people even if they have	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 4

oh that that pretty good size	6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
well when is the	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
i- i	6 6	6 6

ask them to remove your uh number from their list	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it does does you know go on	6 6 7 2 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 3 6 4 6 6 4 4
no it it upper middle class uh kind of an environment	6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
we had an electrical storm too	3 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
in political roles	2 4 4	6 6 6
theyre theyre sure	3 1 6	3 1 6
now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax	6 6 6 3 2 6 6 2 4 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh you know uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that- that	2 3	6 6
i do do know maybe	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolutely- it was pitiful	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
ive ive just gotten a	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and it got kind of dark	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 2 4
familiar with uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
but i find it	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
where maybe we	6 6 3	6 6 6
maybe providing	6 6	6 6
the the demand for their goods is quite high here	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
but i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
a lot of	7 5 2	6 6 6
i mean i was watching a thing last night up in washington state	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
they were were overly short-	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it it hard to talk for five minutes on this	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
to let us go ahead and-	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4

it it not what	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
an opera or the symphony or something	7 5 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4

and uh	6 6	6 6
they probably give you a chance to explain yourself	3 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
heard you were from virginia i was like oh okay there there somebody different	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 1 6 6

she and they have to go back	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4

and like you my bullets to my little pistol pistol probably uh	6 6 3 2 4 4 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6

an i an i did get a	6 6 6 3 6 6 7	6 3 6 2 4 6 6
that that great	3 1 6	3 1 6
because i know here uh until you get into high school	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
but they ca ca just bring somebody in	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
i i do do have a sense of loss from that	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
and sometime wed wed watch the weather stations	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4

recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
like a draft	6 2 4	6 6 6

and you know a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 7 5 2 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
is that right	6 3 6	3 6 6
but i am going to stick with downy because they were first	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
i mean most of the people ive ive talk to are from are from texas	6 6 7 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
well hal what what uh what what crime like in dallas	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
well yes	6 6	6 6
uh they term it as more	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and tinman and avalon which are all set in baltimore	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and through high school i could have gone so much further if id id gone to a school that was	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
nobody can think that that it ca ca happen to them	2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
and i moved him which was an extremely traumatic experience	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
well that that true	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
im im im im against	6 6 3 1 6	3 1 3 1 6
showing too much leg-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
um or how do you expect the	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 3
for that very reason	7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
i think it was like	3 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
oh my goodness	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh little thumb print and made it a bunny	2 4 4 4 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
el salvador for a while	2 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4
uh you know the benefits are good	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
i mean it it uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i mean regulation	3 6 7	3 6 6
so im im	6 3 1	6 6 6
you all did it yourselves	3 7 6 3 6	6 3 6 2 4
and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the	6 2 4 4 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6
and he was across the river	6 3 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
bush did that	2 6 3	6 6 6
we got to do this	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 2 4
and it was like twenty percent interest	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4
go ahead	6 6	6 6
their not	6 6	6 6
i said now	3 6 6	6 6 6
i was a i was first generation going to college	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
i just said that this is what i want	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know if everybody everybody trying to incorporate a little bit of it into	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 4
and all of the sudden it was like somebody in the	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
like aids tests and such	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well there must be a a a a a very great degree of that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
what do you mean	7 6 3 6	6 3 1 6
well that that the way mine is you know	6 3 1 2 4 3 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
four and five	3 1 1	6 6 6
i really do	3 6 6	6 6 6
uh and i planted potatoes too	6 6 3 6 2 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
in dallas you do do even know who who in in administration	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
laughter-that laughter-that laughter-true laughter-too	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
rangers decided that uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well does your job-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i did did fit into the nonsmoker nonsmoker category	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
it was miles down the road	3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
but then what what the interest	6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
if it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
have an outstanding balance all the time ill ill ill ill pay more than the minimum payment	6 2 4 4 7 5 5 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do follow actors	3 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6
seasonings salt and pepper	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
and uh weve weve just been really thrilled with it too	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
so i tend to read a lot of uh	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 4 6 4
so well	6 6	6 6
who knows	7 6	6 6
i think theyre theyre really going to have to	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i think it should be a civic level	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
nice furniture and things like that	7 5 5 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh theyre theyre not uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i well-	6 6	6 6
i do do i do do even think that it should be unanimous either um	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
ours has too	3 6 6	6 6 6
but i just i	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
im im on a salary	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
but of course they have a little river going down their area too	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
but now ive ive got another one	6 6 3 1 6 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i think in large measure the reason they do do care	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6
i do do know unless it	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
hundreds of laughter-thousands laughter-of laughter-people is what it seemed like	7 2 7 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but i think it ought to be expanded to include children	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
id id like to see them go to	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
uh prior to january one	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4
uh the crawfish tails already peeled and- everything	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4 4 4 6 4
and uh he took the engine apart	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 4
they do do get paid for it	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
for all i know aerobics started out here	6 7 3 7 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
i ca ca stand	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
we do do have i guess too much trouble in dallas with	7 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
it it supposed to come out and compete with that	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4
i have a nineteen eighty	3 6 7 5 5	3 6 2 4 6
well- well- well yeah	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
well i	6 2	6 6
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6
who is playing you know this mafia- you know this uh organized crime head	3 1 1 6 3 1 1 6 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
but um	6 6	6 6
and just the chimney was gonna gonna be brick	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
i bet you ca ca laughter-guess	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
i mean a shotgun just just struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
or is it	6 6 3	6 6 6
that that in charge of of making those decisions	3 1 2 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
river current	7 5	6 6
and since anyone can get out of it	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean you have to set an example	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore	6 6 3 2 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 3 6 3 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 2 4
i know it	3 6 3	6 6 6
it seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
so it it sociology	6 3 1 2	6 3 1 6
feel about	6 6	6 6
so i i tend to be one of those people who switches	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 2 3 1 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
so ill ill be ill ill probably be wearing slacks as often as i do	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
and ive ive ive ive always- ive ive been wanting to see all of it	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
im im in north carolina	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
it it it-	6 6 6	3 1 6
saint claude	2 4	6 6
and we should take it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
and you have to you do have to pay to take them	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
um there there been tremendous amounts of of uh layoffs	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
i i really feel that that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
and he recognized me	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
those things happen	2 4 6	6 6 6
and so really there was was any problem with	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh yes	6 6	6 6
so it it i think it it a pretty good option	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 6 6 4
you know you know you do do	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
you know how were were affecting the earth and things by what we do as the people	6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know i mean the problem though	6 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i bought it	3 6 3	6 6 3
and i can understand them1 wanting to have them1	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
but theyve theyve gotten theyve theyve got to pay for all that national advertising now	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
so there really was no time to try much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6
it it more less the kids go there	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
and the society society views	2 3 1 1 2	6 3 6 6 6
work with them	2 6 2	6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
but like	6 6	6 6
guess part of the reason there is because of	6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
they charge you for the deposit	3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
it it funny	6 6 6	3 1 6
shed shed been dating a fellow for several weeks	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but uh the miniskirt miniskirt many times will evoke comments you do do really want	6 6 2 4 4 7 5 6 6 7 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 4
it just seems like they	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it it just it is just a great cat	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean they go right back where they came from	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
so i did that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
employment place exspecially-especially especially	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
i i do do know that i	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
im im gonna gonna try pressing one again to make sure	3 1 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
did a lot of growing up	6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 4
try and stick with that	6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
and just	6 6	6 6
somebody getting	3 6	6 6
do you have a car	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
i i spent four years traveling around and did did see you	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6
just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a laughter-cat	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4
uh were were having a for all unclassified programs were were were were having little tables put out in front of you lab in the hallways	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
but i did did know that	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
spend it if it it necessary	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
since we live here and we all benefit	6 3 6 6 6 3 7 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4
and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten	6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so that that the main point is that we are going ahead	6 3 1 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 4
i think two years is too short	3 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
somebody was writing in complaining that the people had um	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
i really- do do really know if they still do	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh in the area of defense	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
people that are down and out	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6
well weve weve thought about getting an aquarium	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
that can be dedicated	3 2 4 4	6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
sort of easy listening because1	6 6 2 4 6	6 3 4 6 6
on the college campuses uh there are	6 7 5 5 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 4 4 4
i i do do know where you start or	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well just the just the opportunity to try the voting machines	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
situations like like that down there where they	7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3
and you would have sent	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4
get rid of them1	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
that that absolutely right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
in uh some places	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
and id id have to go in the other	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
uh the the morals that they would be taught	2 4 7 5 3 2 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
that that	6 6	3 1
you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that	3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
some of those books are real tough to get into	7 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know per per uh	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
or you know jeans and blouses or something like that	2 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
but newspaper articles can show whether- how they voted in the past	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4
but i do do want to see him laughter-in laughter-other laughter-things	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and then they hire private instructors	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
there there not a whole lot you can do about it because there there only so many jails you can build	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
nowhere does it say you have- asks you whether you have permission or not	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
they had uh uh	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i heard a joke on the radio yesterday that	3 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 6
men have a lot of trouble with that though	2 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
i just could could believe that he got voted out	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so	7 5 5 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4
i mean i think theyre theyre doing their duty	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
it uh	6 6	6 6
but you had a choice	6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 4
but that	6 6	6 6
they were	3 6	6 6
because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most	6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4
and she has really really done good	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
you ca ca do this	3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
well i like to do	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6

theyre theyre kind of nice	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
you know any felony anyways	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 4
sometimes i think i	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
be on the same level	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
because we do do	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6

supposedly military- military experiences	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6

the first two cars i ever bought	2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it not us	6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6
well id id be interested in finding out what the uh	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
they do do like any of them and then the person gets in and they do do like him	3 6 6 6 7 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
we went in	3 6 6	6 6 6
theyre theyre like hearts	3 1 6 7	3 1 6 6
going to serve about a quarter	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 4 6 6 4
and the nineties	2 4 4	6 6 6
but my mother mother always been administrator of a nursing home	6 2 4 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
ive ive heard	3 1 6	3 1 6
to a	6 7	6 6
cross stitch	2 4	6 6
revitalizing the whole situation	7 2 4 4	6 6 6 4
the government has placed a deposit	2 4 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 4
the uh you know the idea of	6 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 2 4 6
and i mean that is one big thing down here	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and the suspension thing it also	2 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
and then you know they try to raise taxes more	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i think theyre theyre	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
you do do know hebert	3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
i mean you have to get so used to doing it that it it a habit	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4
the book was excellent	3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6
a a professor in criminal justice or something like that	6 7 5 5 2 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 6 6
well have you ever served on a jury	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
and that helps you know pass the time	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
that ends up costing me	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i went to got to go to a bills game this year which was fun	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
i think there there probably about	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
but still it it you know it it really not	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
but that that about the extent of it	6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
but i know they test	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 4
and he he going on to williams	6 3 1 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
it it probably pretty- it it pretty good	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6
not only of	6 6 6	6 6 6
theyre theyre only going to make like three or four thousand	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
but uh i just do do think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6
it it oh uh	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
now we got	6 7 6	6 6 6
it was either sixty percent or forty percent	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
uh that that true	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
based on fact	6 6 6	6 6 6
poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing	2 4 4 4 7 5 3 1	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
where you live is there a real high uh alkaline or ass content	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
and i do do	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
i guess um	3 6 6	6 6 6
the police have to do a lot better job	2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
and it it so hard for me	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
you you	6 3	6 6
but theyre theyre just sort of into clothes	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
so youre youre aware ahead of time	6 3 1 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but the problem is that you ca ca put	6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
extra luxury version of whatever they got	2 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
you can really	3 6 6	6 6 6
uh there there an annual membership fee	6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 4 4
uh end up with- with uh with the jury actually making the verdict	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
they do do she does does shop at foley foley you know and stuff like that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
but at the same time i do do know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 1 6
but when you get inside theyre theyre really nice you know	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
metric number like	2 4 4	6 6 6

the crime was horrible	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but i	6 3	6 6
that we have to plant	3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
oh he was found guilty	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
are they gonna be taught something	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
and so that that kind of why i guess they stuck us	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6
um about a month later	6 2 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4
but i i i i think that that the that you know the	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
you know and theyve theyve got a real big problem	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
well theyve theyve	6 3 1	6 6 6
i live in a development	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4

it it was enjoyable for a while	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4
but that has changed a lot	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
it it pretty much funded well	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 6

well it does sound very interesting	6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4
and if youre youre still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee im im	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
the more money they put into it	7 5 5 3 7 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
units that that how youre youre going to think of it	2 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
smarts about you then you really do do have to worry	2 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and like i said we always ate beef and uh pork	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
apparently i do do know all the details	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
it needs to be	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and one of the things that weve weve	6 7 2 4 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
and then they wonder why it does does get done in the same amount of time	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
high school education	7 5 5	6 6 6
and i had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
ill ill tell you	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
that can be pretty serious	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 4
i like it so far	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
such and such you know theyd theyd have to do that percentage of work and	7 5 5 6 7 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 7	6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
well you know more and more of them are	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i think so too	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well that that how cleo was- you know	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
it it kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 4 6 6 3
well i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
that that	2 4	3 1
uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but then again i do do want the bugs eating it upping either	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
so it it it it pretty quiet	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
uh have you talked with a lot of people in this project	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out	3 1 2 4 6 3 1 6 6	3 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4
i i live in uh vermont	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
i uh	6 6	6 6
well im im an environmental engineer	6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
see the people that own the house they uh	6 2 4 3 2 3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i was working to get through college and	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
the only chow he he got is is his tongue	2 4 4 3 1 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
but i want to show him how to use it so that	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
supposed to be guaranteed and and everything	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
gets done	6 6	6 6
but uh i got down here	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
and i think theyre theyre trying to	6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
i live in a big metroplex	3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
and there there there there no waiting period on that	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
what what he teach	7 5 3 6	3 1 6 6
um we got two cats	6 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
a place called quality auto parts	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4
you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 2 4 4
and i liked him	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
other views to it	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6
it it hard to get a protein content up then	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6
i mean ive ive been kind of dragging the last few weeks	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4

but my daughter-in-law daughter-in-law daughter-in-law daughter-in-law from panama	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 3 3 6 6 6 6
i mean that can really benefit	6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 4
even after you wait your nine days if you do do know how to handle- it it just like putting someone in an automobile that does does know how to drive	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4

so laughter-you laughter-know it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
oh it it great afterwards	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
nine months	7 5	6 6
to find the right one	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
well the early ones	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
boston boston above	3 1 6	3 1 6
so we now isolate them	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
if you ever get a chance to go over to vicksburg the battleground at vicksburg	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
they are	3 6	6 6
can have all kinds of prejudices and things that a judge at least officially is is supposed to have	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6
um what	2 4	6 3
we have some engineers that still	3 6 7 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 6
well and you always	6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
i do do know if that that been challenged in the courts or not	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
that that you know it it working	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 6 1 6
little too lenient	6 6 6	6 6 6
well i am just going you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
me generation has gone far too far	2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
we can handle it	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 3
i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
im im a product myself	3 1 2 4 6	3 1 2 4 4
are the uh oldsmobiles that youre youre looking at are they the demos	6 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean everybody was furious	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and while i do do do any drugs myself ive ive seen some people who work there	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 6 4 2 4 4
and and yet we ca ca to that either	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and things got worse and worse	6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know how it is in the air force base	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
checked at uh an independent service station	6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
not that they wo wo appoint them1	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
but making it a mandatory thing	6 6 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
he did it in that	3 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and there there teams in the united states	6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
i have one theory	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
and i do do remember what they are	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i	6 6	6 6
it to point where	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
it it very difficult	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
in in case you are on some sort of medication that	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and and that way we can be sure you know	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
so i felt kind of good about that you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
of course that it it a constitutional right that the press	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 3 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
i have have done this in a couple months	3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i just went because we could could	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6
and um i know my husband	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
i like la la law	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre protective	3 1 6	3 1 6
people just	2 6	6 6
i live on a third floor now	3 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 3 6 4 4
and uh to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
there are a number of good movies like that	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
per capita murders are incredibly lower than the united states	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
there was no	6 6 6	6 6 6
does he got them1 locked up all the time too	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
every person has their opinions	2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
there there less time spent outside	6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
and training is different than anything else	6 3 6 6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the um	6 6	6 6
now then they had the voting machines	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 4
not having any mechanical problems whatsoever-	6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6
i do	3 6	6 6
that that been about ten years ago right	3 1 6 7 5 5 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
compression ratios	2 4	6 6
is that girl	6 3 6	6 6 6
he could fry	3 6 6	6 6 6
that really is	3 6 6	6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
but the crime is so bad laughter-there	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work	2 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6
first of all first and foremost the bills games i want to see	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 3 4 6 6 6 6 6
so if my car that long ill ill be okay	6 6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4
im im kind of disappointed with the iranians	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4
firmly believe in that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
perhaps somewhat even with the business	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
just lucky to have jobs	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6
we agreed pretty well on this i think	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
well what would you have at a dinner party	6 7 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6
and plus for for the	6 6 6 6 7	6 6 4 6 6
degrees is is much	2 6 6 7	6 3 1 6
a long time longer than we would like it to	7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know smoking a joint or whatever	6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i ca ca remember a year when we did did have one of some kind	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
economics in the area that you come from	7 5 2 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
were were were were going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and theyve theyve had had a lot of of uh	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
and in that	6 6 3	6 6 6
we have a plum that that just about ready to go	3 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
im im taking this history class	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
i i i have have fortunately been in a situation where it it been applicable to me	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
but i i think that there are	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and it would have devastated them1 if they would have taken it away	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh wake me up when it it over was about the eighty	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6
mine do do either	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
except that i do do trust the people who are appointed to vote	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
and they work less	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
he was in uh uh honey do do shrink the kids	3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
they have a big brother big sister program	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well that was a subsequent case that we did did know about	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
um ive ive never really joined a club because i have have got the time not because i have have got the desire	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 1 6 2 4
an interesting concept of	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i went where i wanted to go	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4
you can start	3 6 6	6 6 6
texas and one in new mexico	2 4 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
a glue mixture	7 5 5	6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 7 3 7 5 3 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
and when they were questioned about it they said well were were running late	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i just want out	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear uh a tie or a dress shirt everyday	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
was denied	6 6	6 6
astro astro i guess is what it	6 2 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but make it so that it it not glamorous	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and up her laughter-nose	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
i guess i have a hard time	3 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
so he had to laughter-put laughter-up laughter-with laughter-it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6
or death before the firing squad or whatever	6 2 4 7 5 5 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
but it has been about three or four years of uh uh	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3
they will put the kind of clout on them1 that you ca ca really do	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
and some are in	6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6
he he one of the big proponents of that	3 1 7 2 7 5 5 2 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
are tested a lot	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
the problem is we are all really scattered around	7 5 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i do do know how my my parents did it	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
for a kinesiology program there	6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6
and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world you know who just end up	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6 3
and and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 4 2 4 2 4 4
it it very frustrating and even even with health food stores and	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6
it it kind of like waterfront property or something if youre youre you know if youre youre two miles away from water	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
and if that that gone um i i	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3
i do not think it it done by uh	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for laughter-years	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
rehabilitation centers	2 4	6 6
i guess it it just that maybe people are	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
for instance	6 6	6 6
and then go to mcdonald and have a hamburger and not thing a thing	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
you know pretty much took care of that	6 6 6 6 6 7 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
initiate that some sometime in the next couple of months	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and i go okay	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
we put ours up	2 6 2 6	6 6 6 6
and ive ive always enjoyed dance	6 3 1 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6
i was summoned down to the courthouse last week	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and i took i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 3 2 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and and	6 6	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
not knowing the language	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i know i i spent thirty years in education here in the dayton area	3 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
that way youre youre sure theyll theyll never ever going to walk the streets again	2 4 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
some of those places have wonderful activities and things	7 2 4 4 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
ive ive had	3 1 6	3 1 6
but i tell you what	6 3 6 3 7	6 6 6 6 6
say a national curriculum because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is	7 5 5 5 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
to me a functioning part of society	6 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 2 4
but my son needed some money	6 3 1 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 4
whereas yeah in a smaller	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated was- was when	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
since that time everybody everybody gotten some sort of burglar system or you know uh	6 2 4 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
uh teams other european teams	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
that really has changed the way um i look at the news	3 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
and theyre theyre picking it all up	6 3 1 6 3 7 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
hold on	6 6	6 6
the the real nice one	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
the person who sells the gun ought to	2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3
well well buy it	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
oh good	6 6	6 6
nobody has this many laughter-relatives you know	3 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
laughter-i laughter-do laughter-do laughter-know	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
but we never even thought that about when we got the dog	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
well well see you later	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
weve weve got imperial sugar	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
and he was exonerated	6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6
the world does not revolve around west virginia	2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i definitely think they should be tested	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
the top you know	2 4 6 6	3 6 6 3
is it this weekend	6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6
im im not sure that that that an everyday thing though at least not for	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
just i feel- i feel like even that little bit helps	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
i do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
well that that wonderful	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
i have have seen a one	3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
weve weve done it	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4
unfortunately that kind of thing is not	6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
most of your uh	2 4 4 4	6 3 4 4
i mean you figure there there got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
theyll theyll	3 1	3 1
stuff like that	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that that that a great deal what law school school like	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
but weve weve kind of driven these people	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
well those theyre theyre kind of nice	6 2 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
laughter-that laughter-that a whole different sport	3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and im im not feeling invaded	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
the brake fluid leaks you know	2 4 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
you know we had prohibition for awhile	6 6 3 6 7 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it was okay	3 6 6	6 6 6
i guess first amendment- the the search and seizure	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
and they are going to recycle them1	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
the uh	6 6	6 6
you get a guy down the street	3 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
boy i could could do that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4
and so forth and so on	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
it is in australia for example	3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4
we can find out the truth	3 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 2 4
two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 3	6 3 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
because everybody that that in drug trafficking-	6 3 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
buses um	2 4	6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime	6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
so i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i take it in once every seventy hundred miles for its periodic maintenance	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
with uh	6 6	6 6
well i work for ti ti too	6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 3 6 4 6
because1 a lot of these guys you know they get in	6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
this guy is putting me on	3 1 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
they said at the bottom of the sat sat sat scores of graduating college seniors	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
the fire alarm went off for some reason	7 5 5 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
double or sometimes triple	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
ive ive ive ive never	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
i think they just ought to	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
it was	6 6	6 6
so the houses actually on our street are a little bit theyve theyve kind of gone a little bit nicer	6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
lot of lot of	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
i was trying to think if there was anything else	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh well	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
that that what i mean	3 1 1 1 6	3 1 6 6 6
so uh it was one of those things where	6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
and it it a fairly	6 3 1 7 5	6 3 6 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
i guess	6 6	6 6
so it it you know	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
um ive ive never noticed that	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
it it easy to do once you find a elephant foot	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh	7 5 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 7 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
but it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
for what	6 7	6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
and it was bad	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i did not know the hyacinths- hyacinths were going to die	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
and um	6 6	6 6
it it it it uh	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
so it it easier for us to say you know to an iraq you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
because1 i was using the american express strictly for the travel expenses	6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
it is just really so sad	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
it just a little	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
at least what i read	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4
it it a problem	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i certainly do	3 6 6	6 6 6
especially on electronic goods	6 6 2 4	6 6 4 4
well i think it was uh thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
do you have that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
my six year old old kind of	3 1 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
and i feel like i mean	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
im im trying to get laughter-out	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
and second of all	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
if they were voting	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
it it real easy to say that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
it used to be service merchandise was the place to go	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 4
id id like to see those	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
it it since since	6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6
you always end up in this conversion thing all the time	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between you know what you see and how you	7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
and and the people who want it it it not that big a deal like i said to wait	6 6 2 4 3 2 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and it it makes it pass pretty quickly	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
what do you do	7 6 3 6	6 3 6 6
for whatever reason-	6 6 6	6 6 6
and their cats you know their their so use to the attention	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten	3 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
the subject is is big city crime which is something	2 4 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
we do do have enough power	3 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
but you know we do do really do any gardening	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
that that very cool	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 5 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
i know i know they do do	6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 1
similar problems	2 4	6 6
we do weve weve got the direct sun	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
ive ive always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time	3 1 6 6 6 2 7 2 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
so you do do have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
and i suspect that it it probably just a fluke you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
what do we currently have	7 6 2 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
how about you	6 6 3	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and he just loves it	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
but i wonder if it it still	6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 3 1 6
also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
hm i certainly ca ca argue with that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4
wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
oh oh i can believe that	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4
and it was normally carbureted	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 4 4 4
crime situations here they	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6
ive ive never asked her any questions	3 1 6 6 3 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
on the project too	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
but the reason they had to do this was because so many people	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
oh i was really trying to think	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i really would like to	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
and somebody apparently drove up and took her	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i tell you	3 6 3	3 6 6
they belong there	3 6 6	6 6 6
into the ground than it is maybe to just	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
i mean i read that the other day	6 6 3 6 3 2 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and when it it really cold im im more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4
and i	6 6	6 6
i believe it was one of these um one of these um mixers these like these juice machines	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
im im not	3 1 6	3 1 6
and you never know	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
just a little shell to go under a suit you know	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6
i do do think the higher ups were thinking about	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh not if it it done fairly	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen	7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
out that so funny-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh booklets good for uh	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
but then the team was sold	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 4 4
but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4
i think with the current war on drugs	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
president bush	2 4	6 6
but you know i think they can	6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if were were going to	7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6
people are	2 6	6 6
put them1 in jail	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
just what that area	6 7 2 4	6 3 6 6
the computer	2 4	6 6
laughter-or is something wrong with it	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 6
there probably are you know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
there there the lead pollution	6 6 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 4
i ca ca think	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
really you know	2 6 2	6 6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
i am	3 6	6 6

and and actually i agree	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
when she calms down theyre theyre so scared of her	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
only it was was like cats at all	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
running things	2 4	6 6
well you do have a hard time finding time then do do you	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
all of them1 every one that they played	7 2 3 2 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
but he he seeing something constructive come out of it	6 3 1 6 3 2 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
she grew	3 6	6 6
and it	6 6	6 6
we enjoy fooling around with it	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
rusty because1 he like you know a	2 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well that took care of that industry	6 3 6 7 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
because theyre theyre both in their in their seventies and uh the cat uh although it it a little bit of work for them sometimes turned out it turns out to be a	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
do do really know	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
i do do know that anybody would-	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
preparing for the	6 6 2	6 6 6
instead of	6 6	6 6
that that very true	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
the problems	2 4	6 6
but if youve youve got the death penalty hanging over your head	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1 1 2 4	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and it came out during the trial that um	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but i	6 3	6 6
and uh laughter-it was	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
now that that tougher	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
do not deserve	6 6 6	6 6 6
i i hold it in the utmost contempt	6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
plus you get it all wet	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
basically seventy	6 7	6 6
well thing is it it a global	6 2 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 2 4
and they put them right near where they	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars	6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
i know	3 6	6 6
do you think um	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
realistic everything they do	6 3 1 2	6 6 6 6
have you seen the new uh dodge stealth	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
what type of job do you have	2 4 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and the other one was sentenced to life	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
well that that a neat idea	6 3 1 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6
so that	6 3	6 6
uh soaker hoses made out of old tires	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh not defense	6 7 5	6 6 6
and uh just interviewing with companies right now	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
in the education we have today	6 2 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
and heat it	6 6 3	6 6 6
uh as far as	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
with it because1 i	2 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
some buildings do	2 4 6	6 6 6
were were going to discuss the different issues and stuff	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4
well my son was just dying for a bird	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
so how do you feel about capital punishment	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual	7 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
well you know you just have to decide you know what-	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
go right down to the wire	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
it it not quite that simple	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
it would it would be pirated	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
divisions through robberies	2 6 2	6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club	6 2 4 4 6 6 3 7 5 5 5 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 6
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
dig it out and make sure	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
an old single shot twenty	3 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 4 6
this is the only place that you do it which was you know out far and away	3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 3 1 7 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4
she she	3 1	3 1
we have work schedules	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
because if he he interested he he going to study it	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6
and even though they told us in advance that you could	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
and uh just the space and	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
i mean i do do i do do think	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and then it got wrecked	6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
were were trying to cut cost and everything like that and and recycle and all that stuff	3 1 6 6 6 2 6 3 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
theyre theyre really	3 1 6	3 1 6
i used to work uh	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
i hope to	3 6 6	6 6 6
i i think it certainly should be one of the options	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
especially when it it so far removed	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
be able to keep his guys healthy	6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4
it was austin motors engine and running gear	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
cover that many people	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
so we ended up having to go halfway up	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
so im im stuck with six forty	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
a lot easier to detect things that go	6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
a couple weeks months ago	7 5 5 5 6	3 6 6 6 4
i guess primarily by accident	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
personal opinion	2 4	6 6
do do you	6 6 3	3 1 6
in terms like this i i	6 7 5 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
but second	6 6	6 6
my next oldest daughter that that in college in california is a world twirling champion	2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
been into science fiction that much	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
he he an aerobics instructor	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 4
the jury -will make a recommendation as to leniency or	2 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 7	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 4 6
do you think he won from carter because of the um	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4 4
their inability that to that their vote does does count anyway anyway	2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
just a leafy	6 6 6	6 6 6
i do do know what the name of it is anymore	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way	6 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you know employer is also already doing it	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
you call me one more time im im going to stop laughter-subscribing	3 6 3 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
they brought	3 6	6 6
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
i think in an area that that really thick with mosquitoes	3 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 4
so see it it really strange	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
do you	6 3	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
well you have to pennsylvania	6 3 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 4
when we moved here to monterrey it was a big change because it it such a small community	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 3 1 6 2 4 4
i feel like president bush is in a hard spot	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
well no	6 6	6 6
so if you ever go in a restaurant	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
when i got into college i struggled i struggled just to	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 6
laughter-is laughter-is laughter-a laughter-crime	6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6
and and it it not it it not just that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and i had a meeting with the uh vice principal and the english instructor	6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 4
they that that really gotten bad	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
get anything	6 3	6 6
who were construction oriented	3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
you know i think i think that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6
but theyre theyre very friendly	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
at uh jc jc penny	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
oh man	6 6	6 6
have the- i mean	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
come into a company as you sign a paper saying that i will go take a	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 6
in the big cities you know	7 5 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
there there no doubt about it	6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
no one could make heads or tails out of some of them	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
because1 it it his bird- well the first one that we had	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh turns out it was a prescription	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but really we did did think about the people that he was going	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6
it was was any of my immediate family anyway	6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well good	6 6	6 6
uh she was was she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working hospital- dog hospital animal hospital	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
he he just	3 1 6	3 1 6
and and	6 6	6 6
this is the mansion at turtle creek a tip	3 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 4
i thought seriously about joining at that time	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
im im glad that theyre theyre staying in arlington	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 3 3 1 6 6 4
uh floor level minimum level that that a standard	7 5 5 5 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6
and we ended up with them right	6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so we did did really contribute it to that	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
repair capability of	7 5 2	6 6 6
i have a twin sister	3 6 3 1 1	3 6 3 6 4
six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know	7 5 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3
that that all right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i mean you ca ca get it	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 6
away from you	6 6 3	6 6 6
and i know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 3
his house actually ends up being nicer than lots of in the neighborhood	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 3 1 6
in that it seems to me theyre swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that that presented	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 2 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6
and i find that really interesting	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
you know her	6 6 2	6 6 6
and i had a hole in my roof	6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
well you probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i mean the jails are crowded	6 6 7 5 6 6	3 6 3 6 2 4
you have five	3 6 3	6 6 6
leaving the home and going out to work	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
that that what what happening here	3 1 1 1 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6
and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4
uh how about1 you	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
used to	6 6	6 6
do an hour hour of aerobics and then take a shower laughter-and laughter-get	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
so i better not go	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
oh gosh	6 6	6 6

theyre theyre both national level swimmers	3 1 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6
well i get them	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
maybe we do do need to do that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it like if if your father owns a grocery store and youre youre really interested in that there there no reason that you should take	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 4 6 2 4 6
uh at the laboratory rolm laboratory griffis air force base up here	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 6

you kind of	3 6 6	6 6 6
and perhaps	6 6	6 6
that was a good movie too	3 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
it it good news	6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6
but they did did go vote	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
small enough	6 6	6 6
i was never into those movies either	3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so just funny that some wealthy man tipped this iranian	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
i have done a little bit of that	3 6 6 7 5 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
oh it it national	6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6
i really like those	3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6
uh some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
im im not sure	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
when you do that it it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot	6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
are able to collect the money from the various	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and hell hell go outside	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
you had-	6 6	6 6
scouts scouting	6 2	6 6
going to trial for murder	2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
and i i do do see that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
and you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 3 1 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
it it that that	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
i guess i believe i	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
that i found to be uh	3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
we got simply laughter-red	3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
or are they	6 6 3	6 6 6
and my mother taught me how to make it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and put it in the bank for three or four years	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6
nowadays it it not the case	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 4
ive ive got	3 1 6	3 1 6
ive found that out	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
you know we have uh	6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6
i mean it is so far down the road	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but he told us there were	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
just different shades of that because1 my	2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
you know it it it it it it totally ridiculous	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
id id rather see the ball	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
uh out that way	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
this is i mean	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and there there uh there there a lot of people here in baltimore that uh have	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
um ill ill get like	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
on the on primarily on soft drink pop and that kind of thing	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 4
i have to call and get it fixed	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i mean she was already two and a half	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6
kind of unheard of when i was young	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the irs irs irs	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 3 1 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
of uh people to teach math and sciences	7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
just um	6 6	6 6
rates of	2 4	6 6
they send these off to	3 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and the men that drive the trucks	6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
and how long theyve theyve been there	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
of uh as-	6 6 6	6 6 6
pretty cheap	6 6	6 6
um if it was some- you know coming into the store and stuff then she would had- whoever made the purchase would have had- sign some kind of um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
philosophy that- that was here in you know twenty years ago	7 5 3 7 5 5 6 7 2 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4
if i	6 3	6 6
i have been just so happy	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
in my work	6 2 4	6 6 6
and it	6 3	6 6
they can all hold such	3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
this- one that you raised	3 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 2 4
in that in that instance	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
so he took the skunk too	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 2 4 4
it it it it a duty of the parent to do that	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 3	3 1 3 1 6 1 6 2 4 4 4 4
and it	6 6	6 6
well do you mind if i ask what it it worth down there	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 3 1 6 6 4
we went to the play-offs	2 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4
so i	6 3	6 6
a lot tougher from it was when i was going to school	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
i was going to ask you	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
but i have just learned with-	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
i am looking for a pen	3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
not in plano	6 6 2	6 6 6
ive ive talked to my mother about that several times lately	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 3 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
it was terrible	3 6 6	6 6 6
oh she do do even know how	6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i think it would be fairer	3 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4
that that what we have to do though	3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
deserve a safe	2 7 5	6 6 6
you know come out and just won all kinds of games in spring craningtraining training and then gone on a	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
you know we are what we teach	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
that took like a minute	3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4
when you were um when- when you serve it do you shell them and then serve them to	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
that that a pretty good idea to do it that way	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
we do too	3 6 6	6 3 6
a real real possibility	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
it was good	3 6 6	6 6 6
so let let talk about	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
so education	6 6	6 6
just like now you know there there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6
it it kind of their	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i do do know what she calls them and	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
are you just trying to say that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
i am	3 6	6 6
little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
but ive ive started to turn it on a little bit for the baby	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6
the expense of it all is	7 5 2 3 7 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
it cost me over five hundred laughter-dollars	3 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
goes through	6 6	6 6
i- i like mostly the older groups	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but to keep the guy that that illegal from getting his hands on one	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 6 6 2 4 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
sae sae sae	3 1 1	3 6 6
i it it taken me a long time to understand that uh	6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6
i remember working on those cars	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
but it turns out a pickup was was what i really	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
little league this year	3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6
parachute pants	2 4	6 6
in addition to	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that exactly right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 2 3 1 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
like a hundred or so pounds of manure	6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 2 4
you do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
weve weve got	3 1 6	3 1 6
and after the two week period was up	6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
admit to you that they cannot- do do have the benefit of being able to you know of of letting allowing themselves to believe their client- client innocent guilty	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
it just makes the whole place seem like that	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh most of the cars	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
she uh	6 6	6 6
that that that that it a lot of the time	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
the when we came back	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
he uh	3 6	6 6
what is that sound	7 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
and ive ive been out of school too long to answer this	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
political science	3 1	6 6
but uh that jimmy johnson came in too though	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
but i do do really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6 4 6
i do too	3 6 6	6 3 6
lot of rap music	7 2 3 1	6 6 6 6
and uh i just wondering	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
in in plano it it open classroom situation where they do do have walls	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 3 3 1 6 6
a couple of kids fifteen year olds	7 5 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 6
think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
um income tax on something that you purchase mail order	6 2 4 6 3 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
you know	6 2	6 6
lower level high school level or	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean just	6 6 6	6 6 6
in in texas	6 6 2	6 6 6
and he is for the l the uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
nice talking to you too	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh you know theyre theyre not going to do their job which is	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 3
and well they were were really that bad though when they were introduced were they	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know the it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 4 4 6
demanding it it just not caused	2 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
because i consider that a drug	6 3 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
it it hard to tell	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
what i think	3 1 6	6 6 6
right now im im in college	6 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6
uh i uh	6 3 6	6 6 6
do you	6 6	6 6
they said that they are irises	3 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4
i- i will try to pay everything off the next month	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
selecting a jury and youre youre doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have	6 2 4 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7	6 2 4 4 3 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
so that that that kind of been the way ive ive done things is to get things that are new and then	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
church state softball leagues	3 6 2 4	6 6 4 6
if we see a child that we have any reason that that on drugs such as if he he got a beeper or theyre theyre if	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 3 2 4 4 3 1 2 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 2 4 4 3 1 6
teach what i know	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and they do do really have	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
uh my	6 6	6 6
this things was	6 6 6	6 6 6
they do do know what snow is	3 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
money tends to stick where it lands first	2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
but because of that we did did have very many pets afterwards	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
having pets	6 6	6 6
for a couple of days there	6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
i i think they should have just done more	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
there was more gore than i was interested in seeing	6 6 7 5 2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
i try to look at	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but on the other hand	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
is it	6 3	6 6
not without wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6 4 4
and there there ten tooth brushes in there	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
well i guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 4
paying them uh sorting them out assigning them training them	2 3 2 4 3 2 4 3 2 3	6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
i have have	3 6 6	3 6 6
ive ive had	6 6 6	3 1 6
for the punishment	6 2 4	6 6 6
well im im originally from uh ohio	6 3 1 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and also because i wanted a weapon	6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i guess air traffic controllers i would would want them to be	3 6 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
the attic or i guess crawl space	2 4 4 3 2 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and it is stripped when you come back	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
you would would even dare put these signs in the window- little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
and uh what part of virginia um	6 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
well if youre youre insane enough that you can go	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
i think uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
slightly- slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
because1 anyone can be alone for	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
turn at the end when you found out who it was	7 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 3 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
well you know id id like to see what she she doing you know	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever	2 4 4 7 5 2 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 4
it it it is instrumental	6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
my husband- my husband teaches in plano	6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
in california there there uh almost an assumption	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
well is that a good indicator	6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6
and of course the people down in south they do- theyre theyre not used to	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 3 1 6 6 6
with all the peer pressure that that going on with all the negative things it is uh it it a tough environment to be growing up in	6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6
theyre theyre corrupt anyway	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
how much benefit itll itll do them in the long run	7 5 5 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
now i also uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
how you do that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
well it it random in the sense	6 3 1 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
and i enjoyed it very much	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
a term limitation for congress would be like three terms or even four terms	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
you know so it it it it really kind of a complex problem	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4

science fiction	3 1	6 6
i guess	3 6	6 6
for colleges	6 7	6 6
the ceilings were so short	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
that that that that right because	6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6
and support	6 6	6 6

that that terrible	3 1 6	3 1 6
you you think about you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 3 2 3 1 7 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 6 2 4
im im from new england	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
they you become	6 3 6	6 6 6
in hindsight	6 6	6 6
so that- that was kind of a surprise	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
the same manufacturer	2 4 4	3 6 6
think that that happened in a lot of cases	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4
that that difficult	3 1 7	3 1 6
well um	6 6	6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
that that great	3 1 6	3 1 6
was also the same place i got the best price	6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i think i think	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i had had thought of that	3 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
they are booked up	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
a lot of people do do think it would be a deterrent	7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 3 6 3 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
something something wrong	3 1 6	3 1 6

bought one	6 2	6 6
of course if the person person never done anything bad before according to the judicial system	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
if and if it it a private sale of course then there there nothing	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6
are base	6 6	6 6
he he he he just about a year old himself and never had really	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 6 4
i mean it it one thing that i and the colleges knows that	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 2 3 1 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6

the housing so cheap	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6
and get that done this summer	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
and he did did have a chance to	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6
there there coming to a point real soon	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
because you get up	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6
it it really nice	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i mean they have to get permission	6 6 3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
id id kill him	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
in packaging	6 7	6 6
it it something of the distribution- theyre theyre on the distribution end	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
is it is it limestone under underneath	6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 4
if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can	6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4
anything political	3 2	6 6
but i do have friends who live in the city	6 3 6 6 7 3 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know women get maternity leave	6 6 2 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4
government and services	7 5 5	6 6 6
and you get your options youre youre looking at fifteen	6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
our home care provider for our day care provider	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
be able to be gainfully employed again converting	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 3 6 4 4 4 4
there there a lot of boating out there	6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4
i mean he he just there	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
she just does does get paid for it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well the- some of that	6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6
it it not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
and it was done internally	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
getting warm right	6 6 6	6 6 6
somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with	3 1 1 2 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
it it a nice area	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
but i- i- i went through that too when i was in school	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 2 4
but is is there a way to um to deregister yourself after you register a gun	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
you knew this	3 6 3	6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
or you know physically and try to to remove them	7 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and and we certainly turned into an air conditioned	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
and if a mechanism is put into place	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
mississippi probably does does have to worry too much	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
well no	6 6	6 6
that that certainly no kind of deterrent	3 1 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and some of those other places i would would have	6 7 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 4 4
but i did did realize that was the biggest waste of water	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
from my car radio	2 4 4 4	6 3 4 4
he he a mixed breed	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 2 6 6
my husband goes to pick it up last week	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and i tell you	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week	7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4
i do do specifically	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
you were down at the principal principal office and	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 4 4 4
im im doing this	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
and uh once you kill off a few of them	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
uh i guess it comes from a sense of facts or facts	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
i most certainly could could educate three	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 4 6 6
and you wanted to go back some	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case	3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
innovativeness because	7 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
they have showers and full bathrooms	3 6 2 7 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 4
i can talk	3 6 6	3 6 6
thatd thatd be kind of laughter-nice	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
and theyre theyre stoned to the bone	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
is already uh exceeded	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i i try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
he changed brands to a brand he does does like	3 6 7 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 6 4 6
i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
someone like you said someone else is counting	6 6 3 6 3 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
but some things	6 2 4	6 6 6
she continues to do it	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i mean i think i think the only ive ive ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
you all these things	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
they ca ca	3 6 6	6 6 6
it it a creek	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
so do you	6 6 3	6 6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
uh i like the idea of juries of your peers	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 4
i talked people from	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
right now i just	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
know laughter-at laughter-this laughter-point	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
you are are given the chance to	3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 2 6 6
um im im ann	6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6
i guess so	3 6 6	3 6 6
people do do like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote again vote against them	3 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 7 5 2 3 2 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
and were were going to try to see if we can pickle our own	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6
and it it the son and so on	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 3
red meat	6 6	6 6
i have a similar problem	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
it it usually well liked by people i guess	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and all the	6 6 6	6 6 6
now i know what it is in singapore is they have the death penalty	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
career a normal career uh when youre youre thinking of things that people might be doing	6 7 5 5 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
disconnect them from the head	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
and because the cost of living around here is so high	6 6 2 4 4 7 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and and robbing them	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 7 5 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
all the sudden it it the most important thing	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4
anything that	3 2	6 6
like if	6 6	6 6
and i think that that really contributing to this high rate of crime	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
poor or if theyre theyre hispanic or if theyre theyre black	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6
fine and penalty associated with it	7 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 4 6 6 6
uh there there no question	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4
you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
uh scallop um	6 6 6	6 6 6
it was a lot of fun	6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 4
we lived in minneapolis	2 6 6 2	6 6 6 4
reach out to people from all over the	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined	3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
now ti ti has the random	6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and	2 4 4 6 6 7 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6
i do do know how it is there	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that was pretty good though really	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and there there also an antigovernment mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
or a twelve gauge shotgun	6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
theyre theyre theyre theyre pretty smart	6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 4 6 6
that most of it it plea bargained uh half way through	6 7 2 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
well is typical for the area	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
especially if you get them1 for a couple of nights you do do have to watch them1 all at one night- one time	6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
not temporarily but permanently	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but she she still on her own i mean	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
there there a big difference between baltimore and washington even though theyre theyre so close	6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 3 3 1 6 4
that recycles everything	3 2 3	6 6 6
either i mean	6 6 6	6 6 6
it was great	3 6 6	3 6 6
that let give the attitude that well you know	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
rangers have got a new guy this year	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4
would would	6 6	3 1
she gets real confused on distances	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4
but then just another different set of people come in	6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6
it it just as hard as having that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them	6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
show some sort of violence to settle the	7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6
i kind of uh	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i know i always i like to to get right on the water	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
probably better let you get back to work	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the variety and everything	2 4 7 3	6 6 6 6
it it always ran just fine the clock and stuff	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
that sort of stuff	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4
you know it	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know i guess that that some	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
that that a wonderful wonderful job by robin williams and peter de niro	2 4 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
maryland is probably one of the	3 6 6 7 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i uh i agree with you there	6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
when you know you buy cow manure at the store theyve theyve added stuff to it	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 7 5 3 1 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 3
but when they get them in these tiny little areas	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 4
but i do do	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
we would would have to drive	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and five words per minute	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
well i- im im what im im uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
and uh because uh i	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i mean if you think about those years that	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
and i really ca ca i really dont-	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
ill ill tell you that	3 1 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6
maybe in the backyard	6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4
it detailed how this one person went about	3 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i see	3 6	6 6
in in dc dc area	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
well im im only a little bit familiar with the red sox because i lived up in boston	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 1 6 2 4
another amusement park down there busch gardens	2 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
that that just part of it	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
watch the news every day	6 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
because my mother had six girls	6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
i guess last year when i went back to work i had	3 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
you know i would not mind it	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
an i and- i feel bad for the policeman	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
they they go full- uh year-round uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and competing	6 6	6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
or was it not	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i-	6 6	6 6
filled the the	6 6 2	6 6 6
and in the long run were were all paying for that	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
well you had some there	6 3 6 7 6	6 3 6 6 4
how many times have you heard where uh uh a	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause	6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
those two mixed together with with water and uh	3 1 1 1 1 1 7 2 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6
and you can just stand there and work on it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know if he had the preference i mean his	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
of course there there cases where someone has been	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
so it seems like a lot more	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 6
well i mean	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i i think there there a a shadow of a doubt	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 7 5	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
figure out who has a drug program or has a drug problem	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4 4
random testing	2 4	6 6
so i have auditions coming up	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6
and what you see on the tv tv tv from you know	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 3 4 4 4 6 6 4
we had one guy that could could throw	3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the death penalty is not called for	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
youre youre the the person person fate	3 1 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 3 6 4 6
just the judges	2 4 4	6 6 6
well if they went awol what are you going to do	6 6 3 6 6 7 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and if you i guess if you keep trading-	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with with uh false positives for certain kind of drugs	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4
i decided all right im im going to start exercising again	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
that is one solution to it	3 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
im im pretty bad	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i was thinking-	3 6 6	6 6 6
you bet	6 6	6 6
what id id really like to laughter-have	3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and theyre theyre going out and marching on the corners and taking taking back their laughter-territory	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
so where are you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
a lot of that	7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6
a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking	7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
well i	6 3	6 6
very little	6 6	6 6
regular street	6 6	6 6
but if youve youve narrowed it down to one or two	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
our neighborhood is a planned development with	3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i would be far better off being in the paralegal field	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
prior to that all we got were	6 6 3 7 3 2 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
he was fortunate	3 6 6	3 6 6
but the taxes would be you know	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
something we can think about later	7 2 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4
most people have relocated to the washington area	2 4 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and the costs to society	2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4
when uh	6 6	6 6
and that that really helped a lot	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
he does	3 6	6 6
and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him	6 3 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
what do you mean by world music	7 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so you ca ca keep the dirt out of the tent	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
and youve youve got	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
blue jeans and a t-shirt	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
i think that is a very wrong way to handle	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
liked a lot of the new music	6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
but i i think id id much prefer to pay the twenty ninety	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and then um	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know im im not sure	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 3 1 6 6
but in civil cases i think a majority rule by by jury would be sufficient	6 6 3 1 1 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
do you	6 3	6 6
it it really uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
so uh	6 6	6 6
you know get laid off or something	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
so i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
what what more important	7 5 6 6	3 1 6 6
you all uh	3 7 6	6 6 6
so there are quote tribes of people	6 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and democrats usually are supportive- more supportive of public	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
because theyre theyre going to be good	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
but he he a man	6 3 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 6
down to shreveport	2 4 4	6 6 6
uh and i think that can happen in a very wonderful- wonderful way	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
really bad mayor and then	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
all right	6 6	6 6
everyone coming in	3 2 4	6 6 6
is that i think that	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it was	3 6	6 6
and theyve theyve been releasing people left and right	6 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
now because-	6 6	6 6
i guess nineteen ninety is when it start	3 6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
strongly then that even if they did did feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
i do do know what it is off hand	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
where it it tends to get stuck there	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i think she got it	3 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
what- what part of the country are you from	6 7 5 2 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
that that it	3 1 1	3 1 6
was even different than you know sae sae sae standards and stuff	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 4 6 6 6
that property out there	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre not	3 1 6	3 1 6
i do do know they	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
a lot of the crime is very prevalent	7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6
uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel	6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile	2 4 4 6 6 6 2 6 2 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4
fees that that fund these things i guess that that trickled down to the states	2 4 3 2 4 4 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
laughter-one laughter-year down in florida on a vacation for father father day my kids	2 4 6 6 2 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
they can barely scold the children for something	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and i appreciate the conversation	6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 4
she dressed him	3 6 3	6 6 6
they just uh they just started a recycling program	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
people are always mobile- you know	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 6 6
have you ever heard about that one	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 2 4 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
we were very heavy into that	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
here here some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6
pay nothing in taxes	6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6
and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in south dallas	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 2 4 4
pay his debt for what he did wrong	6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but other than that	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
i think uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
well you do do own cats	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6
there a that you you can still	6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but to the best of my knowledge we have have had a major	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4
youre youre right	3 1 6	3 1 6
well that see i- i did did believe anybody would believe that either	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know kind of deltaing off what	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
um the ammunition is probably so old im im afraid to use it	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
illness they wish	2 3 7	6 6 6
oh boy	6 6	6 6
there there i think	6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6
but there there would be even be a situation where	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
they do do ever have to go out and get a real job	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
the brown one	3 1 1	6 6 6
chevy van that that a couple of years old	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 2 7	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
but it is uh	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
where i lived uh it was a little town called newmarket	6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
where her job is	7 2 4 7	6 6 6 6
you know especially like repeat offenders	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
threatening to send a snake through the mail you know	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6
it it more	6 6 6	3 1 6
i really do	3 6 6	6 6 6
but but i do try and um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 4
they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
quarterback in the	2 4 4	6 6 6
i mean that- that that why i like to read sports illustrated so much	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
that is really strange-	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and it only had had very very low mileage on it	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6
well i had had read it	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 3
i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to uh	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
ive ive never had to protect my life or	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
not in the sense of the republican party now	7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
et cetera	6 6	6 6
and and the only thing	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6
to wear	6 6	6 6
i- i do do know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything uh that would be irrational	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 3 2 3 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
i know that that what i want	3 6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know well well keep the polls open until eight oclock	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
and the one that that accused was the one that actually did it	6 2 4 3 1 2 6 2 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6
i just go to be entertained and	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
oh may have been kentucky a few states you know that were not part of the south but still had slaves	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 3 2 4 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4

do you know who chuck mangione is	6 3 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6

and he let me shoot	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4

in fact we put in some uh some more roses yesterday	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
and i think our courts should be geared	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
see about being a legal assistant	6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 2 4 4

it it hard to know what the good movies are anymore	6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
maybe that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
group your behavioral problems together	6 2 4 4 6	6 3 4 4 4
i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in laughter-music	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
oh did you	6 6 3	6 6 3
what it it like	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
cash- you can make a good living at it	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
has nothing to do with	6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
i ive ive	6 3 1	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
in raleigh	6 2	6 6
the world does revolve around d c	3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
when i first started teaching	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
one of the women that was in the	7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 3 4 6 6 4 6
there there celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers	6 6 7 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something	6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
well see	6 6	6 6
an ounce of hind sight is worth	2 4 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6
um but it was it was really good	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i- i make a fair amount of money	3 6 7 5 5 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
these things wo wo make any sense to you probably	2 4 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4
clean out the flour and stuff like that	7 5 2 4 7 2 4 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
my degree	3 1	6 6
so that that	6 6 6	6 6 6
motivated that way so that theyve theyve incorporated that into their program	6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
it has one of the best school systems in the country	3 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
and putting that guy into into therapy to	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
gee that that not a bad idea	6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre really quite arrogant about it	3 1 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
pillsbury plant	2 4	6 6
such as	6 6	6 6
i think you can only get it through subaru dealer etcetera	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
well since since texas and louisiana and uh california that in that ranking order the worst pollutants in america	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
i think that that a lot of it too is that people	3 6 3 1 7 5 2 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
but he just left for italy today at four	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
it you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
it was ridiculous	3 6 6	6 6 6
so im im curious especially since ti ti	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
maybe that that why we had it this time	6 3 1 6 3 6 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
weve weve had those	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 3 7 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
having a massive ballot every four years	6 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the teams that	3 1 1	3 6 6
they they had it built from you know	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
they think they need to	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
for the environment it it	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
he was a little surprised	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
as uh	6 6	6 6
and without and and it it just they do do look at things	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
even like	6 6	6 6
fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton	2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
a friend of mine gave me	7 5 2 3 6 3	6 6 2 4 4 4
is that everyone needs to be tested	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean she really could pick up on my mood	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but i think our latest statistic- statistic said something like	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 2	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6
i do do know where in the world it is	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
put you know that chemicalwise that they use	2 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
and soccer	7 5	6 6
texas is not one of them see	3 6 6 7 2 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i was just trying to think	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
and then the	6 6 2	6 6 6
i mean- well	6 6 6	6 6 6
well that	6 3	6 6
well that that that that that the key	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
theyre theyre not	3 1 6	3 1 6
but the the wind there has been so bad that	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
they make them	3 6 3	6 6 6
do a whole lot of repairs	6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4
i most- most- most wholeheartedly agree	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
parking is very tight	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
so it just goes down the dining room	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
and im im really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
especially in cases in which there there no smoking gun	6 6 2 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
that that so much less democratic	3 1 7 5 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 4
kids to	2 6	6 6
i just	6 6	6 6
were were were were going to be were were	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 3 1 6 3 1 6 4
now this needs to be done- this is the time this needs to be done	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
it really is	3 6 6	6 6 6
identify the guy	2 3 1	6 6 6
and the lady was very nice	6 2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
but i really do enjoy cooking	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6
and their mother mother maiden name	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
always home by the time you got home	6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
a good	6 6	6 3
from uh i believe it was ross dress for less	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
howd howd you get into it	6 6 3 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
these you know drill in the right ideas	2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
absolutely delicious	6 6	6 6
they have that here	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
you know theyre theyre kind of fearful of everything	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 2 4
baseball here though is the cheapest game in town because the cowboys	2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 4
things like that	7 5 2	6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
like um	6 6	6 6
would be some measure of protection	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
a lot of wisdom in it	7 5 5 5 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
oh just uh refilled- refilled- uh probably	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
about a four year old i believe	2 4 4 4 4 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i have have lived there for long-	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and it it really	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
and they were like well no one was going to miss him anyway	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
but i- i agree with you there that uh	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
quite a collection myself	2 4 4 6	6 3 4 4
that is a way to put it	3 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
uh the place weve weve been living at it it uh were were were were just leasing in	6 7 5 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6
weve weve become almost litigious	3 1 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 6
well it seems like there there there there a lot	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
the fact that	7 5 5	6 6 6
i live right on the ocean	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
four boys	3 1	6 6
you know that it is incredible	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
well i think you know they did that in alaska	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
it it got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6
so were were going to theyre theyre going to stay there which is fine because arlington arlington got a lot of things to offer	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
well i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
and it it a wildlife	6 3 1 2 4	6 3 1 6 6
laughter-huh laughter-yeah	2 4	6 6
program that um company wide	2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
that the rehabilitation	7 5 5	6 6 6
i usually like to do most repairs on my own though	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6
they have to go with the	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean our defense was	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6
essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was was licked	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 4
it becomes a kind of music of it own	3 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6
because the character- the the character that is so horrible is another human being	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
uh the	6 6	6 6
but i think theyre theyre going to i think theyre theyre really going to do good because it seems like theyre theyre finally all coming together	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 4
but um	6 6	6 6
and say okay look we need somebody	6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i mean that	6 6 6	6 6 6
and the four cylinders just do do have it	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
that will knock him down if they leave the property	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 2 4
kids learn at different rates	2 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 4
i think	3 6	6 6
uh i think the only the main thing is just keep on the legislators- your legislators legislators back	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
little over of a year	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4
i do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
just one	3 1	6 6
it occurred to me	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
less than half the trials that go to uh less than half the cases that go to trial	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 2 4
you you call that number	6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 4
not at all	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i take	3 6	6 6
and it was	6 6 6	6 6 6
with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics	6 7 5 5 5 5 6 7 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
helps their educational process there	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 4 4 6
twelve people you know	2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
because it it all different builders up here	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
that was pretty good	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
right now it it running at about	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
were were thinking thatll thatll be a lot of fun	3 1 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6
uh and and just go out and	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i belong- i belong to quality paperback book club	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
i agree	3 6	6 6
i believe youre youre right though	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
thirteen years ago	2 4 6	6 6 6
segment that he said that if the money	2 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
im im uh	6 6 6	3 1 6
and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be	6 2 4 3 2 4 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4
back in the eighties	6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
but the bedrooms are too small	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
and it those who do do vote would have voted exactly the same way	6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
you can always refuse	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i ca ca even remember what the recipe recipe name is anymore	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4
and airplane pilots	6 7 5	6 6 6
when i you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre terrible you know	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
the um the	6 6 6	6 6 6
there there enough out there that if you have if youre youre educated enough then you can make money	6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but i thought well i am not going to do that	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
are problems	6 2	6 6
and they would would bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who who offering	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6
and that that it	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
no conditional- unconditional affection from the	7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
and you can say something	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
if if everybody bands together	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 4 4 4
itll itll go up	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
the uh	2 4	6 6
smashing them up because theyre theyre	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
but ours is about	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything	2 4 4 4 4 7 5 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
it it	6 6	6 6
so uh but uh you know the	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
maybe not the four years definitely	6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 4 4

to see a little bit more of that	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
much of a rush really be able to enjoy it	7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4

uh families own a refrigerator	7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all	2 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 6
uh jim kelly	6 2 4	6 6 6
if it it like	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
um alone	6 6	6 6

um we both got our internships at the same time	6 2 7 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
when it it starting to breakdown	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4
cousins and their best friends because1 they all grew up in new york city	2 7 2 4 4 6 2 7 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
try not to cuss	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
and that that uh that i can honestly see the peer pressure there	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
gives a summary of the	6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6

if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it	6 3 6 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6
i do do think they have the right to do that	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and you get satisfaction out of it	6 3 6 2 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 6
thatd thatd be really nice	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
the time in	2 4 6	6 6 6
in uh new hampshire	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
hard way	2 4	6 6
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6

you get involved in organized	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4
and they have a game	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4
well i think that was part of it	6 3 6 3 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that an everyday occurrence	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 4
did you	6 3	6 6

taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something	6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
although there were some other women in her class she was you know uh one of the minorities	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4

see we really do do see the	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles	3 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
when um	6 6	6 6
all right	6 6	6 6
a couple of soaps lately	7 5 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 4
the only gripe i have	2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 2 4
well uh have there been significant changes um	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
so once theyve theyve gotten the penalty and there is no doubt	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
off the off the price if you wanna wanna think of it that way	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 4
i guess youre youre right	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
how long has it been since the first one	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6
im im not	3 1 6	3 1 6
there are times when you ca ca avoid all that	6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
just beautifully written	6 6 6	6 6 6
i do do remember what they call it sort of like a	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 7	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 6 2 4 4
uh also ive ive always- ive ive thought around about the idea of	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it like doctors in lawsuits	6 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 4
it it it it no ones ones fault-	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
pay pay the sales tax to	6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 4 4 3
uh their credit card and the status of their credit	2 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
you know someone- one of them1 is going to break through eventually	6 6 6 7 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
defending attorney can find	2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6
he was a prosecutor- -prosecutor	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
but so they just throw something in there just to say they have it	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3
but he was	6 3 6	6 6 6
four or five of them	7 5 5 2 3	6 3 6 6 6
and you know what frightens me	6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean theyre theyre you know theyre theyre pretty and everything	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 1 6 6 4
we were wondering if they uh	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
oh well	6 6	6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
and i took it to town north	6 3 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
on the flip side of that coin	6 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
has has	6 6	3 1
public schools	2 4	6 6
ive ive come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
and i hate that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
all right	6 6	6 6
maybe theyre theyre finally waking up and saying you know we ca ca afford this	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
if if im im a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6
whoever whoever sitting up there making these decisions	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
a person every time you do it	7 5 5 5 3 7 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
was was a seam or anything	6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 2 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
oh how neat	6 6 6	6 6 6
we have telephones	3 6 7	6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 3
and um	6 6	6 6
well it it before they had that	6 3 1 6 3 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
our favorite	2 4	6 6
mom then then dad or somebody somebody got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it	2 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3
ive ive heard that that	3 1 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6
um i think it it important to insure the quality and	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
and it kind of has to start from the top	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
again the purpose of gun control is to control how it it being used	6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 4
uh do you work	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and so	6 6	6 6
i agree	3 6	6 6
and uh it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 6 4
that that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna gonna be	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6
i mean there there no two ways about it	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
well i have absentee voted	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i thought well i was doing them a favor	3 6 6 3 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4
well i had i had a german shepherd before this one	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
a few answering machines over the last two years just because ive ive had a lot of trouble with them working correctly	2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
because i	6 6	6 6
and that that kind of cool	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
well it it okay	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
uh person	3 1	6 6
and they uh the minorities could not get	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
just trust god because	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it it certainly is	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
it already costs society much more because of it	6 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
uh im im usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 6
big flower that looks like a lily	2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then uh we we go on from there	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
yeah as a matter of fact	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4
but i do do see going on a camping trip probably till next summer	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4
i i i hate	6 6 3 6	6 6 4 6
to drop off	6 6 6	6 6 6
what kinds of things have you done	7 5 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4

our insurance paid for everything	2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4

anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i think im im getting a call coming in	3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 3 4 6 6
well see that that me	6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6

you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
we weve weve taken the intermediate step	6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 6
one one count	3 1 1	6 6 6
are things that i think about a lot	6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
i am pretty obvious- pretty constant- i mean i am pretty aware of what goes on	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4

and theyre theyre not reimbursed by the	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
it it a good town to wander laughter-in	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
i guess	6 6	6 6
oh he he he gave it	6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
so it was you and the kid	6 6 6 3 2 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
companies that do at least go into it	7 3 7 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and- and our company has taken that and gone all the way	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
and after after wasting the first six years	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
any case involving	2 4 4	6 6 6
i know one time i was in a political science class	3 6 2 4 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4

university of texas dallas	2 3 2 3	6 3 4 4
but um i think	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good	6 6 7 5 5 3 6 3 6 6 3 7 5 2 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
that that what it was	3 1 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 4
i think there there certainly some professions that ought to be tested	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6

the great big tiles square tiles like that you put on the floor	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 2 4
burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
only work initially	6 2 6	6 6 6
rooms on uh you know on the news	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and i mean it it hard with two	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6
and you know just was not mature enough to keep the dog did did realize how much work it was	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
come in on these things	6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
youve youve got to see it	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
and then you know it never did	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever	6 3 6 6 6 7 2 3 6 7 5 5 2 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
there was a woman	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
parents and things that are being	2 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and to me a whole new experience	6 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and uh so im im im im really quite	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
you put	3 6	6 6
i think so	3 6 6	3 6 6

oh man	6 6	6 6

they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably	3 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 4 4
well that means youre youre going to put them in a cage	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 4

and their their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4
and then you add all these other ingredients to it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
they say theyre theyre uh remarkably incompetent	3 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4

it it north	3 1 6	3 1 6
i think that that	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
it it going to be from the ground up	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know just how she treated them how	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
ill ill let you go first	3 1 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4
and it it so	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6

i will tell you another plant that is purply	3 6 6 3 2 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
i could could believe that she could could think of any place	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but now we start in may	6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 4 4

that that interesting	3 1 6	3 1 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
ive ive had a terrible day	3 1 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 4
more rooms and less space in each one i guess	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 2 4
and so my budget comes from my dad dad help	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
now i have quite a few credit cards that im im always almost up to the limit on most of them1	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 3 1 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
is that sound familiar	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6
one of the first things the russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh	7 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
sounds like the way the federal and state system works laughter-now	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
who who who who not very well educated	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 4 4
were dressed exactly alike alike men and women	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
very definite uh	7 5 5	6 6 6
that there is a problem	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
it it sad	3 1 6	3 1 6
buckets of of water	7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
refresh my memory	6 2 4	6 6 6
it was amazing to me	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
it it it faced with uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
and they	6 3	6 6
i have to check t news every everyday everyday	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 4
and uh there were two other couples with us	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 4 6 6
ive ive never thought about um	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
probably should	6 6	6 6
sometimes the more you get the more you want too	6 2 4 3 6 2 4 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i guess a few years after id id started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 3 4 6
i think that has been a major change and also the fact that um there are so much- many more women in the work force nowadays	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
i have have either	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6

that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
he he going to be working for chevron in houston	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2	3 1 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
all of her animals that she ever had were adopted	7 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
it really does	3 6 6	3 6 6
do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
in texas im im serious if it gets cold and it looks like it it going to rain	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
but it it still nice	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i usually do	3 6 6	3 6 6
keep badgering you about it	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
well not really	6 6 6	6 6 6
well australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the united states	6 3 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney	6 7 5 3 2 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well youre youre probably luckier than	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
ironic way a lot of good came from the vietnam war toward	2 4 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
i see some of the problems the kids have when they do do have a real good family structure	3 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
last night on the news i heard they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you	2 4 6 2 4 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4

i wo wo turn any of the buttons down	3 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and the prosecutors do a lousy job	6 2 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
own cars and trucks with air conditioning	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
in fact uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
i would think that it would be their obligation to report that	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
that that considered world music because it it not particularly using	3 1 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
do you	6 3	6 6
it it almost like uh	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
just because it usually	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
from california seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and	2 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
that would be prettier	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 4
uh environmental concerns	2 4 4	6 6 6
and so that was	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
and now theyre theyre wanting to go back to the	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
with two little kids i can understand that	6 7 5 5 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6
but as far as putting that into work	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
um they had to impose a curfew	6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
there there some real weird people that he seems to come up with	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
my husband and i went	3 1 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the army	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4
and she sends her taxes	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
i want to write this down because	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 4
anyways the deterrent	6 7 5	6 6 6
well im im too tired	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
and i	6 3	6 6
asked to wait before starting to work	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6
i think that were were too easy	3 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
if you are looking at like	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back	6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
that that about all	3 1 6 7	3 1 6 6
he loved it	3 6 3	6 6 6
and then also to videotape videotape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
well the one that we had just did did want any part of that	6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
i ca ca believe that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and i do do know where i even put that laughter-paper	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh oh	6 6	6 6
uh having the car checked out	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
she always had uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that supposed to cut down on it	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3
united states	2 4	6 6
and theyre theyre still let out on the street after one or two years	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
and then theyve theyve been sentenced to death	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
pretty much a lot of people would know about it	6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6
and and then	6 6 6	6 6 6
just because it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and and your occupation is	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 6
and my husband went out of town	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
than there were	7 6 7	6 6 6
ah the budget problems up here are	6 7 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
obviously go out and do it again i mean youve youve got to do something	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 3 1 6 6 2 4

well were were to the age now	6 3 1 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
finding excuses	6 3	6 6
and whether- whether or not you agree with that law	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
like you have a little bit of	6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6

both the people and the incidences- incidences	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 4 6 2 4 4
to go see	6 6 6	6 6 6
and that that the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party	6 3 1 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 7 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4

security aspect for long term employment uh	7 5 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 4 4 4 4 4

and youre youre going to run	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean there there plenty of things to talk about there	6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
which i had never thought about before	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4

how- how important it is to	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4

i think i checked that as a question id id be willing to discuss laughter-too	3 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 2 4 4

the situation that that developed with the	2 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
basically three different areas	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6

these are children that are born with low deficit attention deficit	3 6 2 3 2 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
but i may be working like a fescue in because of	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
but i used to i used to live in india	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
unfortunately the way the	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh the city	2 3 1	6 6 6
i mean there was was any electricity on the camp site	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and i forgot about the one in the chamber	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
thatd thatd sure seems like a long way	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know something	6 6 3	6 6 6
it it kind of like learning a language you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
then maybe my privacy has has been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
there there	6 6	6 1
in fact weve weve got far too many	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
it it in dublin texas	3 1 6 3 2	3 1 2 4 4
im im going to protect my family you know	2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they have a death penalty	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
uh done a done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4
i was military at the time	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
he looks like rick moranis	3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
just fabulous with her	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
just recently this uh black man	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
so is mine	6 6 3	6 6 6
and inside this lunch box he he got	6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6
well you live almost in oklahoma	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 2 4
they ca ca afford not to	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
have you had	6 3 6	6 6 6
get myself to	6 3 6	6 6 6
doing sentencing without the jury	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
so they just felt absolutely awful	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
they would understand probably by the time they were in high school	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
what was	6 6	6 6
easy to take care of	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
now i have got her in a montessori school	6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and that that where we stopped	6 3 1 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 2 4
so uh	6 6	6 6
just about on death death door	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
what what is your suggestions	6 7 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh	6 2 4 6 7 5 3 1 1 1 1 1 6 6	6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
the last thing ive ive done	7 5 5 3 1 7	6 6 6 3 1 6
i do do know what advice id id give them	3 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
in the long term that women are going to be	6 7 5 5 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
they look down on them	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
but i mean if you ca ca do it with men on base there there something definitely wrong um	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 2 6 6 3 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 4 4 4
there there quite a bit of crime	6 6 7 5 5 2 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 4
those those people trying to help the kids	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but onto the thing um	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 2 4 4
now when i graduated high school	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6
to what they see at home	6 3 1 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
oh there there been a lot	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6
but then you have you have the same abuse of power	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
so im im sure that happened to me too	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands	6 6 3 6 6 3 2 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
it ended up better	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and my	6 3	6 6
he said theyre theyre much	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 1 6
id id agree that	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
live a full life	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
and everything	2 3	6 6
there is a lot in the society where things have changed	6 6 7 5 2 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
you know nice	6 2 4	6 6 6
uh these children are	7 3 1 7	6 6 6 6
and there there so many different problems there	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
so she stayed with her about roughly two years	6 3 6 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
so that uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
whether theyre theyre really concerned about their rights or whether theyre theyre really concerned about something else	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
and that that it it really too bad	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
take your name and driver driver license number hunter hunting license number and all that good stuff	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
technically it it a privilege	6 3 1 2 4	6 3 1 6 6
when i feel really ambitious and then get angry ill ill start poking holes up there	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
that kind of a a group of kids	2 4 4 4 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person	7 5 3 1 1 2 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
the day after hurricane hugo had come through	7 5 2 7 5 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
because they have other things blocking where we need to do it	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
sort of crime	2 4 4	6 6 6
what what that	3 1 1	3 1 6
a pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that that really so common that it it accepted as the norm now is the open- the open office concept	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 7 5 2 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh she had puppies the same week my daughter was born	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
i would think it	3 6 6 3	3 6 6 3
uh no	6 6	6 6
i think that that important too	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
i im im im amazed because the sun is so intense	6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i was very well persuaded to walk out	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
play jazz flute or anything like that	6 2 4 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
in fact	6 6	6 6
then the actual shot does does go that far you know	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 3
i do do talk to many people in the military	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
they send their kids to school	3 6 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4
you- i guess you pay the piper	6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
oh i know something	6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6
an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles	2 4 4 4 7 5 5 2 7 2 4	6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i said well i really appreciate it	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3
um and that that a very	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
so if they started putting it in liters	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
little value just in whatever you do	2 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and then a few big stories	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
that that what god god told them to do	3 1 1 2 4 6 2 6 6	3 1 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think that sounds fascinating	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
i know i know theyre theyre working with him	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
the first thing you do is you get up and you	2 4 4 3 2 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and you have to sit at a table and just	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
not really	6 6	6 6
it was going to make such a mess	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and ive ive had a lot of problems with this one	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 1	6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6
but um because that was was really	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 1 6
expend some	6 6	6 6
you would would even have to leave it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
it it a matinee	6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6
he he a black man	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 4
it it counted cross stitch	6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
that has something about all drug dealers	3 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it just probably a good thing that the oil oil burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
soy sauce or whatever	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6
doing the exercises	2 3 1	6 6 6
it it drives just wonderfully	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
ai ai nobody going to beat us	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 3 1 6
i i mean i can relate to that because im im im im going to college right now	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
which you know	3 6 6	6 6 6
after the bloom dies they are not pretty	6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh im im a	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
excitement in it you know	7 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
when they go to other people people houses	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 4 6
that that one	3 1 6	3 1 6
takes a heck of a long time i guess to get there	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
on a on an on a	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
and the blended families	6 2 4 4	6 3 4 4
so it just turned out to be too much of a	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
and now the uh other team	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
and the aerobics is is too boring	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
and i- i said	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
you too	3 6	6 6
do do represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
in other words you know you -do -do have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
during your time there	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
highland park park thinking about going that route	2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
burgundy wine	2 4	6 6
well it was very good	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and wed wed have three and four feet of snow	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
not that id id remember that much from the fifties	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
im im surprised to hear that	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
the the state the government- the federal government	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
my mom has a uh	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
a little bit of experience with it	7 5 5 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
very much so	6 6 6	6 6 6
that- we we do do have um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
it it kind of uh	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
he was out of country one time for three months	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
then you pull the	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
when we sent back in our information we had to tell them1 how many people were going to be coming	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
well it it been nice talking with you	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6
and knock wood that uh	6 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
we live in a	2 6 6 7	6 6 6 3
it it the same way with everything in education though	6 6 2 4 4 6 3 2 3 6	3 1 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 3
now see i would have never figured that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6
the neighbor across the street	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
i think one thing i do do like about aerobics is that after im im finished it it kind of late at night	3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 4
um i mean	6 6 6	6 6 6
and im im glad to see there have have been any this year	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
i i wish it would snow a little bit more	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
is messed up	6 6 6	6 6 6
but we did okay	6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6
but when they pollute into the air	6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
baseball books	2 4	6 6
uh the uh united nations was setup in in san francisco	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i thought well how do you how do you weed those out	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
oh definitely	6 6	6 6
i said you take that skunk	3 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 4
whole thing was about the size of a	2 4 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
homeless and that type of thing	7 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
what what do you think	6 7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
it it sort of funny	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
well i mean he he doing all right probably	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
probably true	6 6	6 6
i guess you did did get your deposit back did laughter-you	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
some of these	7 2 4	6 6 6
so i try to i try to catch that	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
that yes uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
when i was seven years old	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
i was like my god	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
it is	3 6	6 6
this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had uh	3 1 1 2 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6
weve weve got two great big windows in our back bathroom	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself	7 5 5 6 2 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i finally gave it to my son	3 6 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i guess that	6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
it is	3 6	6 6
you sound so young	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
industrial engineering	3 1	6 6
you know accessibility of people to be able to break in	6 7 5 5 2 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
ranch style home	2 4 4	6 6 6
um i do do remember myself	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
that that really great	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
ive ive been ive ive been sitting here thinking	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
wow huh	6 6	6 6
you know i think that that probably true	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 3 4 6 4
that that interesting that the military saw that and did something about it	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 3 2 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6
but yeah	6 6	6 6
i always try to emphasize the	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 4
that it it heartbreaking	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
im im not going up there	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
one thing or the other	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i think they only have four boys	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6

that that a lot of repeals	3 1 7 5 2 4	3 1 3 1 2 4
and theyre theyre never going to let liquor in there	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know several times a	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i i agree	6 3 6	6 6 6
you know lots of stuff going on	6 2 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i think was two sixty	3 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6
and just started	6 6 6	6 6 6

you kind of wonder what really happened	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh how	6 6	6 6
the inner harbor and the uh the aquarium and all that are very nice	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh industries well the transportation industry for specifically- uh you know specifically	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 4
and i did this	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6

im im in garland	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
to students because theyre theyre going get	6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
so that that kind of how i judge	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
day school	2 4	6 6
be understanding that you know there are different ages	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6
and i	6 3	6 6
and i am not just talking about you know uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
and they bring their drugs home	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 2 4 6
just one bloom	6 2 4	6 6 6
and i-	6 6	6 6
i use a couple things form amway that it says	3 6 7 5 3 2 3 2 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
i think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
because1 i did did realize that um	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i do research	3 6 7	6 6 6
i mean the action is is in west virginia	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
prohibitive act	2 4	6 6
swimming weather	2 4	6 6
uh and	6 6	6 6
and uh showed me	7 5 5 3	6 6 4 6
just not feasible	6 6 6	6 6 6
would that be uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
they seem to have done a	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 3
oh well that that good too	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
and they	6 3	6 3
youth more directed towards	3 7 5 5	6 6 4 6
and this is actually a	6 3 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
you know i that	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre pretty liberal on it	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 3
see in california they	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you do do want to go do that when you do do have to	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
cat that i mentioned	3 1 1 1	6 6 6 4
so i felt real good about that	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know once	6 6 6	6 3 6
i i would think that that true	6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
have a good life uh	6 7 5 5 6	6 3 1 6 6
i do i do have to make myself go	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
uh all their kids and their grand kids and everything	7 2 4 4 7 2 4 4 7 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
that in that ultimate goal	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and i	6 6	6 6
people- people across the street have eight	6 2 4 4 4 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and so i often drop in on a break and	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
needlework using using the uh	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6
i hardly ever go see a sequel	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
and the moon roof i think is also an option	6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
i think were were	3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6
and then drain off all the grease	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well i had the carpet fixed	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
now there there a crime for you	6 6 6 2 4 6 3	3 6 6 6 4 6 6
it it not the same sort of a thing at all because that	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
and and how do you rate the uh	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i do do drive that much	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
he just	3 6	6 6
and uh so he went in	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
my wife wife about six months along	2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 4
but after you get into them1 theyre theyre really good	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
for years i did all that shopping and what	6 7 3 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it it not so scary anymore	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i think morally	3 6 6	6 6 6
you know i ive ive	6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 4
like um	6 6	6 6
this kid comes to school with his lunch box	2 4 6 6 2 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
you know out of the question	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
you know not what they used to be	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
theyve theyve been raised in a day center	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
you ever seen the the starter bread	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so theyre theyre happening during the hours theyre theyre gone from work	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i guess ive ive decorated baskets and stuff before in the past	3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
it seems to	6 6 6	6 6 6
and they go all right we got a sucker	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and little eyes and nose and mouth	7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
shrimp fettucini is real easy	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
or you get pictures like we did	6 3 6 7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i	6 3	6 6
gifted is is einstein or you know uh musical prodigies	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
i mean either way	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
to do so	6 6 6	6 6 6
we were were thinking about getting a saltwater	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then i think that that going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
or something like that	2 3 2 3	6 6 6 6
some military hardware	7 5 5	6 6 6
your friend friend not going to have a chance	3 1 1 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4
so it it hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
you know maybe	6 6 6	3 6 6
i had my tubes tied	3 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 6
or doing your banking	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
other than that it it pretty pretty lax	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6
and then i you know i did that for six years	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and some of those people	6 7 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
i happen to read- just read something the other day	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
i would say it it probably midsized for the area	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4
uh you can go in a bank and just hand them the visa card and say i want a cash advance	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i saw that movie too	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
personal life when they vote	2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and and i do do know if it it uh the	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
it it just	2 4 6	3 1 6
somebody having a need for a math or science teacher	3 2 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with	3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
and then she got sick on me again	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
to you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
converted it to metric just about as easy	6 2 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i think that you you make of that what you wish	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
but i always	6 3 6	6 6 6
that was even before american motors	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4
it it up to fifty	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6
well i originally come from a state that has uh	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
it it just some ungodly number just to support the military machine	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
that that probably the worst	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
laughter-you laughter-know	6 6	6 6
no way	6 6	6 6
and it was definitely voluntary too	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6
oh i know-	6 3 6	6 6 6
i want to have a relationship with her	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 6
and then i	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that part of it	3 1 2 4 3	3 1 6 6 6
so i tend to look for uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
when i came down	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
but i would would wanna wanna go teach high school or junior high	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
what i did when i was doing that was mostly	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
the other team got the ball	2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
for someone to be set up	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
simply because uh uh weve weve weve weve	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
well it it been nice talking to you	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
be able to avoid paying sales tax	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
thatd thatd be culturally laughter-shocking	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and uh that was that was horrible	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i do do know about your part of the country	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
have have a disadvantage that we do do understand	6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
being put in this closet	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
like a um	2 4 4	6 6 6
the price of freedom i guess is a little	7 5 5 5 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4
you know that really do do have anything to do with how well they do the job	6 2 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that that	3 1	3 1
what is that thing i saw	7 6 2 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6
i ca ca think of the guy guy name	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax	7 2 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 4 4 4 4 4
i mean i do think i could handle prison	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh the first time that i saw his schoolwork	6 7 5 5 5 3 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i hate it for her	3 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 2 4
you know like a highlands or something like this	6 6 6 2 4 7 3 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but theyre theyre still laughter-bars	6 3 1 6 2	6 3 1 6 6
because1 i did some teaching part-time	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to	2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
my brother uh brother used to work for wal-mart	2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know i	6 6 6	6 6 3
in our case we	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
and i could could tell you who pitched	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
that uh	6 6	6 6
made him do that since it was so close together	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but um	6 6	6 6
it it hard to say	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i would personally be the last resort	3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that	3 1	3 1
cars as much as possible in terms of	2 6 6 6 6 6 7 2	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 4
but i think	6 6 6	6 3 6
and then at night theyre theyre bussed out to the occupied territories	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
we were taught metric system in school	3 6 6 2 4 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i i think theyre theyre they have theyre theyre working on uh something in austin now	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 2 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
harder to not serve on juries actually	6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i really do do see why	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
well i think	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that that that what id id always heard	6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
because that that all you hear about is	6 3 1 7 3 7 5 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
and yet	6 6	6 6
and i really do do agree with that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6
and and im im sure theyre theyre colored by what ive ive edited	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6
that that a concern of mine	3 1 7 5 2 4	3 1 2 4 6 4
third of december	7 2 4	6 6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
with our jobs mainly hitting downtown dallas we could could go too much further	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
customs and all those kinds of things	7 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and and like minute	7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6
and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
elephant foot soup you know	7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and it it uh	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
the guy that that doing most of my my car now um goes to my church	3 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
that you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
there should be	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know youre	6 6 6	6 6 6
class in a public um	2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 6
and you know the whole electronic classroom idea	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
and you can get them really cheap	6 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
but just because of a job opportunity	6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you want to start	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
committing murders	2 4	6 6
you know your boss does does come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
so i adopted the uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
instead of learning	6 6 6	6 6 6
weve weve swung the pendulum both ways	3 1 6 7 5 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 6
she she old enough to	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
you got it	3 6 6	6 6 6
that you know	3 6 6	6 6 6
it it just whenever were were	6 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
there were the sixty thousand dollar question shows in the fifties	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4
he was gaining weight again was just	3 6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh uh a jewelry company	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
i ive ive been camping a couple times	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
like i said my sister sister still in it	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 3
but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 3
and um my daughter you know since since she she little has been playing with them	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
and one of the fish was missing	6 7 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it was so funny to see	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and what what so funny they took the car they i knew they were gonna gonna pull it from town north because that that where the white one was	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 1 6 4
well uh say embezzlement	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
and and a big percentage of that was expended as well	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
any pacifitsspecifics	2 4	6 6
well i think that	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
if id id have been asleep for five years and read it in a book id say no no no that did did could could have happened that way	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
compile more statistics	6 2 4	6 6 6
common sense things	2 4 4	6 6 6
recycling center	2 4	6 6
i would agree with you there	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and i think that that that that going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4
i had a very easy time	3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 4 4
quite a	7 5	6 3
if you have to you can get mean with them	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and that that where a lot of aggravation comes i think is	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
that that interesting	3 1 6	3 1 6
out that liters	6 6 2	6 6 6
that this woman	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh hum	6 6	6 6
there there six flags right by the stadium	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
in this general area there is uh	6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
pretty good size problem with	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 6
i mean im im just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
that that funny	3 1 6	3 1 6
it was like they were trying	3 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 2 4
i oh	6 6	6 6
i they did did they did not	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
and it about	6 3 6	6 6 6
but it it it is very nice	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
as soon as you drive up it it got like a circular type drive	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
if it it a limited edition usually	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 4 6 6
a house full of snow	2 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 4
it was really um it was	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean not just because i would would feel safe	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
do you know anything about that new stadium	6 3 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
not being able to put it off for fifteen years	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
a a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
but it it not quite the same thing	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
you have quite the problem	3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4
it it it it really strange	6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6
and i think why do they make us take this stuff	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
well i think the	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 4
but he does	6 3 6	6 6 6
and he was	6 2 6	6 6 6
and they make uh oh about a foot high plant	6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
we were laughing i mean	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i guess i can relate to that because i have two kids that are opposites like that	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
um what um what type roses	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 3 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and um it had been recommended by some friends of ours	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4
like you take asian countries or um the eastern countries	6 3 6 2 4 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
ive ive got uh an eighty	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
is they	6 3	6 6
was cnn cnn cnn	6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6
and i ive ive seen it in other states too	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know in the in the	6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 1 6
no more for me	7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6
because there are some cases when you just do do know	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6
what are your favorite shows	7 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
put things in them1 even	6 2 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
a team that has reasonable talent	2 4 3 2 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4
they had any special law for the horses in central park	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
to me it it humid here	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
either by the hand of your	6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6
when she was born	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
uh guilt	7 5	6 6
well i mean i i guess	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 4 6 6 6
i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies but	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6	3 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
it it got matthew broderick in it and um	3 1 6 2 4 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
who was the quarterback	7 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
hal bought me uh uh small uh well uh uh	7 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
oh youre youre kidding	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
well listen	6 6	6 6
because everything	6 3	6 6
well did you watch the program the other night on um	6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 6
i do do have any now	3 6 6 6 7 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
it has a french name	3 6 7 5 5	3 6 2 6 6
i do do think i would	3 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
other than a	6 6 6	6 6 3
know hardly anything	6 3 1	6 6 6
and if theyre theyre able-bodied people	6 6 3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
and so i uh	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and were were just	6 7 5 6	6 3 1 6
they were not the ones that had laughter-cut that off that it was the national you know	3 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 2 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6
of drugs	6 2	6 6
you got to take some time laughter-off	3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it like	6 6 6	3 1 6
weve weve gone out to um	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
and i believe that strongly	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 4 4
you ca ca operate in a vacuum	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and uh having thought about that for a while	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and teach them1 to farm and teach them1	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh i know	6 3 6	6 6 6
in comparing	6 6	6 6
that that the way it is	3 1 2 4 3 2	3 1 6 6 6 4
just news	2 4	6 6
if you- if you read the book it it uh even better	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
so no one else would have known	6 3 1 2 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
i mean because1 he he always	6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 3 1 6
taking steps	6 2	6 6
well the thing about that is though it it got a	6 2 4 4 3 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
so they do do have that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
the rate- the crime rate really is not very high at the moment	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
that that not really good	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
the question was about uh	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and now that was in fifty	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4
and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex laughter-and laughter-everything laughter-here laughter-and laughter-take them to some other country that had different moral laughter-values	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
during that conflict also	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
well there there also the issue of uh	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
construction corps that went out and did things	7 5 3 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and not through any fault of the effort of the school system	6 6 6 7 5 2 7 5 2 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
who they gonna gonna go to	7 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
come to my menagerie	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
my daughter my daughter lives down in rowlett	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
the guy i was talking to never goes	7 5 3 7 5 5 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
that that okay	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know which really was was our fault	6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you were were home	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
there there a lot of that going on in dallas too	6 6 7 5 2 3 2 4 4 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
people taking oil out of their cars	2 6 7 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and do do they go into other countries and stuff	6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and you expect them to do their job	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
it was in jfk jfk jfk stadium it	6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6	3 6 3 3 6 6 6 6
so i felt more comfortable at that place	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
rip up rip out all the rest of these laughter-junipers or anything that requires uh more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 4 4
i had been through saint joe	3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
what do you call those things	7 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
uh i think it was seventeen years	6 3 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
i appreciate talking with you	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
here you to the logistics of the thing again you know	6 3 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3
we used to go fishing in lake texoma	7 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
but i think that	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i think you can tolerate a lot of problems	3 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well what do you think is uh the pollutants the main pollutants in the air	6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 4 6 2 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
like any other teacher would in	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
with sixty minutes	6 3 1	6 6 6
or i i teach training classes	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre really good cars	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
well why stop at children	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
then we got a a bill saying you know	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i think	3 6	6 6
sell products abroad as much as we bring in	6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
uh i work at ti ti	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
uh say at ti ti	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6
uh things like	7 2 4	6 6 6
and if you test positive	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 4 4 4
and you know that that	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6
but after i looked at this place and i took randi with me uh	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
in fact i think it sort of raises	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and i felt felt	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole	7 5 2 3 1 2 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 4
all right nice talking with you	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
sure it is	6 6 6	6 6 6
first grade	7 5	6 6
the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so	2 4 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
fruit trees	2 4	6 6
and it was sunny and forty	6 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6
i do it all	3 6 3 7	6 3 6 6
because when you when	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
the society of women	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6
that we could see in the next few years	3 1 2 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4
we had saw some termites	2 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6
im im not	3 1 6	3 1 6
how about ghost	6 6 2	6 6 6
but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
but you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh the the other side of that might be if if	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
where you start getting into mils and that sort of thing	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
and he he all the characteristics- all the characteristics	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
undo this	6 3	6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
there must be some truth to the matter see	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6	6 6 3 4 4 6 2 4 4
oh what do they call those the uh	7 3 7 3 7 3 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
and i felt like when they were young that was the time	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
um i think three bins for glass white	7 3 7 2 4 4 7 2	6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4
because1 i like chicago	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
and i think i think that that ridiculous-	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6
some of them have been going on for for tens of years if- if i understand it right in places like the sudan and	7 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i do do	3 6 6	3 6 6
do do you like to cook	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6
arrogant about it all	6 6 3 7	6 6 6 6
and two birds-	6 6 6	6 6 6
i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
you know someone said to me once well imagine	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
oh oh yes	6 6 6	6 6 6
blonde haired heavyset alien	7 5 5 5	6 6 4 6

usually are your drop outs	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
i know weve weve got a good connection	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
and that was their main main money making you know deal for the city	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6

they kept boring that block out to where	2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
uh i personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools to children from the little ones on up	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5 6 7 5 6 7 5 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
i wanted to get one right on the water	3 6 6 6 7 2 4 3 1	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
hell we did did even you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i really-	3 6	6 6
drug testing program	2 4 4	6 6 6
you know were were all honest and everything like that	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
so not	6 6	6 6
i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs	3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 4
and none of them even smoke	6 7 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know i just recently moved to massachusetts	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
uh mine are both out of school	6 2 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
but i only have half time salary	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
nfl nfl nfl draft	3 1 1 1	3 6 6 6
but they	6 3	6 6
now come laughter-on let let be realistic	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
could be a good idea to	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
if i get one i think i will probably you know get something	6 3 6 7 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
youd more harmed or something	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that wonderful	3 1 6	3 1 6
and i you know i did did	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6
that uh	7 5	6 6
thank you	6 3	6 6
i mean you hear-	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
so then it becomes	6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4
they they last for just a couple of weeks	2 3 2 4 4 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and as we can see	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
he still charges you that hundred dollars	3 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
this one was only forty	2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
because1 i finished one	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
oh i guess the first thing has been the right- for the right for women to vote	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 7 5	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
kind of dress the way you feel that day	6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
you know you	6 6 6	6 6 6
mine are are really that bad	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
the changes that women have had in the last generation- well you know not even the last generation the last	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
from the laughter-dog	2 3 1	6 6 6
they essentially	6 6	6 6
in other words	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it the image that the woman has and uh	3 1 7 5 3 2 4 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6
generation or so i guess i anticipate	2 4 4 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 2 4 2 4
bye-bye bye-bye	6 6	3 1
well it was was a lay over	6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and they	6 3	6 6
i think that uh i personally like hockey better because it has contact	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
in the in the	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
there would be real possible for uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6
well you know you you can do that	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 4
you should should have left it there	3 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
twenty and thirty it it pretty warm	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
uh uh	3 1	3 1
and uh	6 6	6 6
for that	7 3	6 6
why they did did go	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i think that they will be more in the work place because	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
so few and far between	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
and and we have these wonderful people who are	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
maybe i should volunteer	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 4
what kind of birds you have	7 5 2 4 3 6	3 6 2 4 6 4
i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
and uh they usually get you know they they make things very	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 4 4
and then he ended up being accused of it	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
back east from	2 4 4	6 6 6
uh i-	6 6	6 6
and i have had just excellent luck	6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it will just take that longer to grow back	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh i do do i do do know because the cats pretty much um	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
but people who bring kids	6 2 3 2 4	6 6 6 4 4
being from california and wanting to hear like	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6
and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um	6 2 4 4 3 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
it it	3 1	3 1
a situation where theyre theyre gonna gonna be guilty of of a crime	7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
maybe that that contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
so ive ive	6 3 1	6 6 6
i i	6 6	6 6
so that is something you might keep your eyes open for	6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6
the toyota that i have	2 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 2 4
because1 i get so angry about what goes on	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
okay now youre youre not going to get to vote	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 6
i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 4 4 4
up to six fifty	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence	6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i know	3 6	6 6
and then like with the stuff of that massacre in killeen texas not too long ago	6 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 3 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
they could help the country in other ways	3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
vast majority of the people at	7 5 2 7 5 2	6 6 6 2 4 3
discount program	7 5	6 6
that extremely enjoyable	3 2 4	6 6 6
and i believe that that just now	6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
going it it going to go to the highest bidder	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
i think they ought to do that with toy guns	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i guess	6 3 6	6 6 6
you bet	6 6	6 6
it has to be one common	6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 2 4 4
it it gotten so big that they had it at the church	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
seat where the smoke would blow away from them	2 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
oh i- i definitely agree with you laughter-there because i had uh uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
it really does	3 6 6	3 6 6
invading my privacy	6 3 1	6 6 6
i do do enjoy it at all	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
when you learn one from the other	6 3 6 2 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i ca ca imagine how i stayed home	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6
not all that common	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it makes it very difficult	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
but there	6 6	6 6
i think it it kind of absurd you know the fact that	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
a little thing sticking out	2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
that would-	2 4	6 6
but it it you know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
let let let let answer the second half of the question	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i ca ca remember the name of the	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6
and that was a lot of fun	6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
well when they went to the	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh how about	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it all new wiring up in	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
are up to the limit	2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
go to a lesser engineering school	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6
that that good	3 1 6	3 1 6
take the kids away from the parents	6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4
maybe that that it	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
you know it does does bother them1 to walk little bit farther put their	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i believe in discipline	3 6 6 7	3 6 6 6
that keep me from	3 2 3 2	6 6 6 6
and theyre theyre	6 6 6	6 6 6
he fixes it	3 6 3	6 6 6
of uh	2 4	6 6
let let have it put them all	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
i enjoy having a nice looking yard	3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
but it it still it it almost like a job	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
the robberies	2 4	6 6
i mean as far as selecting	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4
it it complex question when you start thinking about it is is laughter-it	3 1 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 1 6
probably average	6 6	6 6
burning out of control in	7 5 5 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
for instance	6 6	6 6
to accept women equally	6 6 2 6	6 6 4 6
and their little boy is like five you know	6 2 4 4 6 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
that well it can be	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
lot came with the house and and the lower the price	2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
hey you might as well forget it you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
you just uh we just say say good-bye	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
well now see that that a good question	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
oh itll itll get better next week you know	6 2 4 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
she she cleaning house	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
and it was a live rat	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
i i still ca ca figure out how it broke	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4
uh well now i i think he carpools	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
kind of like you would an american express card and and pay it off every month	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
if someone is is as much as a government person theyre theyre less corrupt and theyre theyre more likely to be good	2 3 2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
just uh one of the major- major	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
or do you go out an buy a a kit	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
ive ive never paid any attention to voting	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
concerned about	6 6	6 6
theyve theyve taken-	3 1 6	3 1 6
i mean i wonder	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
well i do do know how it is up there	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it catching on throughout the country	3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
you know do something different and change some connectors	6 6 6 3 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff	3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
but yet that can be carried to an extreme too	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about1 as big as this house is	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
it it good to see the bills doing so well now	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
than for me because oh gosh they	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
attached it to their letter	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
devil- devil devil advocate possibly	6 7 5 5 6	6 3 1 6 6
this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman	7 5 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
necessarily true	6 6	6 6
that that uh a one ton van	3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
plan my clothes a week in advance	6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the evidence is that	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 3
i think the topic was crime in the city	3 6 2 4 6 3 1 2 4	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 4
new orleans the same story	3 1 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
i mean we uh	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 3
and we had one guy that could could run	6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i mean there there got to be a different way	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
my neighbor or a friend of mine when i lived in louisiana her	6 6 6 7 5 2 3 2 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
and im im not sure that that our role	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
which would i think at that time would have included west virginia and	3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
i was limited	6 6 6	6 6 6
i guess weve weve talked probably long enough	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
im im not im im a pretty bad cook	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i ca ca	3 6 6	6 6 6
that that why i was really	3 1 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
it it very easy	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
um i started at the beginning of this year	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
friends at work	2 4 4	6 6 6
it it far beyond me	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
what what it called when you do flour	7 5 6 6 6 3 6 2	3 1 2 4 6 6 2 4
oh that would be good	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and they brought it down to the shelters	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
and you never know that though sometimes when youre youre going in do you	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 3 3 1 6 6 6 6
i do do like those styles	3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6
i was walking	3 6 6	6 6 6
he was going to focus on it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know	2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
and uh	6 6	6 6
but then there are all these	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and and uh and and	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 4 4
im im	3 1	3 1
or the whole drug testing thing	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
pre group of people could	3 1 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 4
there was no	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that it	3 1 6	3 1 6
hed hed saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird and a bird cage	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 3 4 6
used um	6 6	6 6
the people there went on	7 5 5 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
so uh ive ive read a lot of information	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
um there there	6 6 6	6 6 6
this tiles tiles come loose off the wall	7 5 5 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4

station because i just	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
and what color	6 7 5	6 6 6
and then i got into the bargello	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
so you	6 6	6 3
well that that why there there you know people dealing it because there there money in it you know	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
up to your shoulder in in thistles	6 6 2 4 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
but uh being one of these late in life mothers ive ive listened to everybody else else you know complaints as to what- what what the matter with either their kids or the school system	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 6 6 3 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
but um	6 6	6 6
i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4

and some kids need to be spanked at laughter-home	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6

it it seem to be kind of	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
it it kind of like-	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
that that great as a kid though is is it i mean	3 1 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 3
people that have killed police officers	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4

the people who are over them or something	2 4 3 2 4 3 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i guess ive ive just about run out of	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
the one about the old people	2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4

turnips i mean not turnips carrots	2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4

he laughter-could laughter-he laughter-could laughter-of laughter-hit laughter-something laughter-else	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but i- i do do really usually consider that an option	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4
he does	3 6	6 6
it was really terrible	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
the power plays that	7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6
those are are pleasant	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
what i would like to see happen	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
or does it stay in the bad neighborhood	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
and most of the engine parts seem to be sae sae sae	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 4 4
laughter-well i	6 6	6 6

i mean	6 6	6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
i guess i dont-	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 3
you you get this this whole kind of gestalt this whole package of	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
it it still in existence	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
we had one in virginia that was sentenced to death	3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
and they were very happy with the system	6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know trying to do some uh trying to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
real close	6 6	6 6
well how are the cardinals	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6

of groups heading for mexico	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
and this snake honestly would be	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and there is a few factories	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i	6 6 6 6 6 7 6 3 1	6 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 6
you know from	6 6 6	6 6 6
ooh neat	6 6	6 6
no kidding	6 6	6 6
at the home	6 2 4	6 6 6
but in essence you probably would have worked out fine	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4
oh i know	6 3 6	6 6 6
a exotic pet shop out in california	2 4 4 4 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4

have a real strong opinion	6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6
uh that that neat	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i was going to say do you have daughters	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4

you know	6 6	6 6
i am less than a mile from the baltimore line	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
getting to that age i guess	6 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
you become attached to it	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings	2 7 2 7 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
and i am the director of music in a church	6 3 6 7 5 5 2 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
my background is probably what	2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
but the minute the sun went down that that when it it seems	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 3 3 1 6
and other teachers find the same things for this child	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i ca ca remember the size of the engine	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but you cut you know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh have set up for those who genuinely have a problem	2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
then when you hear the cover it it like you know god	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 4
but that one of my solutions	3 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
so who is your favorite football team	6 7 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4

we bought it sort of	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and ive ive	6 3 1	6 6 6
you know drugs- drugs and everything else	6 6 6 7 2 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
do they not ever i mean i do do know that much do they not ever burn trash or	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6

and that what their hired for and then uh	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
and the mitsubishi three thousand gt gt is the same	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
two thousand out of eleven thousand that that about a little over twenty per cent	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
sixteen or seventeen years of	7 5 5 5 5	6 3 4 6 6

nuke the lawn laughter-with chemicals	7 2 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 4

it it it it too bad	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6
but uh i guess	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i bet	3 6	6 6
also indirectly by that indirect involvement	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
a a freddy kruger type huh	6 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 4 6 6
modern- sort of modern looking restaurants will	2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 6
i i think	6 3 6	6 6 6
and etcetera etcetera	6 6 6	6 6 6
i mean they	6 6 6	6 6 6
and it it a brick house with uh some wood	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 1 6 6 4 4 4
two cats	2 4	6 6
well hoses were	6 7 6	6 6 6
is that	6 6	6 6
she had a daughter	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6

and um you know it- it it still it it just surrounding the city	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and they are	6 3 6	6 6 6
kind of	6 6	6 3
and they they are in effect killing people	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
belts and things	2 4 4	6 6 6
it it a little twenty	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4
i bet	3 6	6 6
if you get convicted of uh	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
he did did you know	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6

the uh	6 6	6 6
i think i have a	3 6 3 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
i think uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and if you if youre youre uh	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 6
there are a lot of	6 6 7 5 2	6 3 6 6 6
and i do do know you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 3
it did did blow up or anything	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
well good	6 6	6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
type program that it it it would catch a lot of things	2 4 3 6 6 3 2 4 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
there are so many people with with their petty axes to grind	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
uh so	6 6	6 6
and the uh	7 5 5	6 6 6
sometimes it it the same people that have been	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 6 4 6 6 6
laughter-oh laughter-yeah	6 6	6 6
they came from all over	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
have you made a lot of calls	6 3 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 2 4
and it it they have a really nice facility at the ti ti	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 4
i think they the drug culture definitely has uh	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
it it a big change	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 6 1 6
it it not as much fun	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
so i do do i do do know if youre youre familiar with him or not	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
presently practiced	2 4	6 6
that they quite literally	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
there there a lot of parking garages there because	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
the little um	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that kind of like	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
that was the first place i ever saw it	3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by uh	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6
we do do really have a problem with that um	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
um i know that there are young people	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
she used to dress him out of neiman marcus	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
that that so stupid that you all have two teams	3 1 6 6 6 3 7 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
that just turned ten years old	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
i i loved	6 3 6	6 6 6
theyve theyve got to have a cause	3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and we did did really know that much about each other other projects for two years	6 2 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 1 2 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
have a good evening	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
well do you do any recycling	6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6
that you know they kind of have an attitude that-	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6
in terms of cost and and- and size and so forth it uh	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 6	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
oh wow	6 6	6 6
um up north like you said	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
that that all you can do	3 1 7 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
let me think who	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
uh without any specific recommendation for uh	6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6
he enjoys	3 6	6 6
just to think about doing it	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 3
meanwhile there were twenty hundred people on death row	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
it is kind of expensive	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
is that the one where uh the guy gets captured by that woman	6 3 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
it it not quite as nice for a little bit less	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 4
also like the unanimous decision because	6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
i have three	3 6 7	3 6 6
theyre theyre going to go somewhere pretty shortly	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4
i do do know personally you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
huh huh	6 6	3 1
you know	6 6	6 6
i do do think	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
and if you commit this crime	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4
i mean the fence is right there	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 6 6 4 6
youre youre put on a program	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
of anyone that that anyone had ever known	7 3 7 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
im im more accustomed to	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
im im not for war	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
you know i do a lot of business here	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 6
and it it shorting out here and there	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
we i	6 6	6 3
and i signed up again	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well the good stuff	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
well uh i guess that that about it	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us	3 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
not much	7 5	6 6
and and	6 3	6 6
all right because we had because we have some we have some old	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
work on that you know	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and and that- that that what frustrates me more than anything	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4
there there there there only one pop machine	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6
seems to be the hot one of of today	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
i was gonna gonna	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and also i think	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and now she she stuck with it	6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i guess that could happen	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
so youve youve received a lot of uh flack	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
the people who um have serious problems i mean	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3
you know	6 6	6 6
im im glad youre youre	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
or maybe the evidence was as sensational as the media presented it	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6
at the time	6 2 4	6 3 6
but it just it was a tremendous amount of cooking	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
you mean the diesel availability	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
that that true too	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
uh i do do have boys	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6
there there are a couple of states that can	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
theyre theyre already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth	3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
to uh to public uh tv tv	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
but i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
so stuff like that is starting to come along where it it really getting fun you know	6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
the last time i took it into a repair shop	2 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
but you sit there in a crowd	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know i saw that	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 2 4 6
but it	6 3	6 6
and i mean i was out of school	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6
i do do i do do know why it would be you know um	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
that that good	3 1 6	3 1 6
well i twirled you know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and they had like just sewed it back together	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
you guys only get a penny a can	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4
sometimes i think we have that right now with laughter-congress	6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that about it	2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6
and you are thinking to yourself um	6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but if you can find a centrally located place	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
when he was much younger um	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6
thank you	6 3	6 6
some sort of public service	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
people have little cubicles	2 6 7 5	6 6 6 4
and killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
well what is it	6 7 6 3	6 6 6 6
the the purpose of getting people in jail so that you know the the	6 7 5 5 5 2 7 2 7 5 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
ive ive got another line calling	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
some of the stations i guess carried it for twenty hours	7 2 4 4 3 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
and can handle a two seater for now	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and now they were were check	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
you have a southern accent	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
oh you must live in this laughter-area	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
when you get into the appeals	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
a car that that new but it it been uh a demonstrator model	2 4 3 1 2 4 3 1 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know i do do know if im im going to go	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
their they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4
migrant hispanic farm workers	2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6
and it it just my thirteen year old and myself	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 2 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
because it it a it it a really old bush	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 4 4
where if theyd theyd if theyd theyd had a class or something or just a short	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 2 4
and they are	6 3 6	6 6 6
indeed i found myself restricting my viewing	6 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 2 4 4 4 4 4
well that	6 3	6 6
and someone else is telling me okay	6 3 2 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
that sounds great	6 6 6	6 6 6
well it sounds like we agree anyway	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
of course it did did turn out that way	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
you need to pay attention to cats and everything	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6
all over the place	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i was look under the hood of that the other day	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know those kinds of things	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
but i have ive ive seen quite a few movies	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and there was uh state park	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4
and im im sure most young men and women would	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i guess so	3 6 6	6 6 6
and a lot of people revolted against that	6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3
you know	6 6	6 6
and to think weve weve weve weve neglected the value of voting	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4
there there no doubt about that	6 6 7 5 5 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
i just	3 6	6 6
you know wed wed just have crawfish and beer or something	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
well when you buy like um canned drinks and stuff like that	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6
you know i think i did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
takes him two minutes	6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6
theyve theyve been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 2 4
you some money	3 2 4	6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
i did not work	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but we had	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb	2 4 4 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know nice floor mats and everything in there	6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
seven or eight hours a day	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
but the	6 2	6 6
which was	3 6	6 6
by the time i get home from work	6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you might be right about that	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4
and i guess weve weve talked long enough	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6
and i just lucked out and walked into this one	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
then they usually get run up pretty laughter-good	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
and then all these	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6
uh right	6 6	6 6
because clothes are some- are really expensive	6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh lobbying	7 5 5	6 6 6
but it was leaking just pouring water	6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
the last one i saw was dances of the with the wolves of wolves	2 4 4 3 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
doing something for the community when im im doing that	6 3 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
to stop the impulse buyer from um buying it quickly and and um maybe putting a week week waiting period or something on it	6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 3
actually paddled up	6 6 6	6 6 6
with that	6 6	6 6
it it uh	3 1 6	3 1 6
if policy is established	6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6
and and put some sensational thing before the public as mike dukakis learned in the last campaign	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 3 6 4 4
uh but i keep coming back to that one	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i must admit that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
looking after the environment sort of thing	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6
uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable	6 6 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
see uh my husband has a thing	6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters	7 3 1 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
only problem is trash	3 1 6 7	6 6 6 6
i said a couple of kids	3 6 3 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know which end though	3 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
to ask you to do anything	2 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 4
and so if ive ive been watching the french news	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6
and uh they were doing a presentation	6 6 2 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 2 4
that that pretty good	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
well like um	6 6 6	6 6 6

the oldest ones	2 4 4	6 6 6
hear about	6 6	6 6

uh they can declare anything they want	6 3 6 6 3 1 2	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i thought okay	3 6 6	6 6 6

it it it it horrible	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6
women are are	3 6 6	6 6 6
and the dirt and grit and	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4

but it it that it it the textured wall	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
just about nineteen dollars worth of	6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6

you know	6 6	6 6
i ca ca envision spending that much money	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
then i do do have any reason to gripe	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it what now	3 1 7 6	3 1 6 6
and im im not	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
as far as any maintenance on my car that i shy away from	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 4
you really you you do do know what it it gonna gonna	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 1 6 6
and clients because1 um im im in im im in public relations in school	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 4
what- do-	6 6	6 3
they tried to	3 6 6	6 6 3
and my cousin lives in paris	6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh sure	6 6	6 6
well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty	6 7 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
the puppy jumped in the	3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
five dollars	7 5	6 6
unless you just get down to the parent level	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
he was a good construction uh you know instructor- instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
dying out is is it	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
with flying colors	6 6 6	6 6 6
and that that happened to me	6 3 1 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
im im convinced that the small	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
they can be in any setting	2 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
too much cooking	6 6 6	6 6 6
i envy her	3 6 3	6 6 3
so much effort put into preventing	2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 2 4 6
like people getting machine from a from an automated teller	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
or id id hold the cigarette under the table	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4
dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4
that are nationwide	3 2 4	6 3 6
bases are pretty safe because1 they check your id id on your way in	2 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
and theyre theyre not regulated enough	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i guess i mean	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it it nice to find there there another reasonable person in laughter-garland	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4
i know	3 6	6 6
i- i can probably go on	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 4 6
well that that true	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
so foley	6 6	6 6
around i guess	2 3 6	6 6 6
well they may cost a little more	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i realize that that i mean	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
tell a person what uh news their a	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4 6 4 4 6
it seems like it it more the upper-class people	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
that that im im im im	6 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
bought it for	2 4 4	6 6 6
do you know what my concern is	6 3 6 3 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
up in uh	2 4 4	6 6 6
old days where you know	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and the woman stayed home and took care of them	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
um well ive ive been to	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
we i do do think we	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
i did something a little bit different this year that i have have done before	3 6 3 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6
through argument	7 5	6 6
we did did even know where the mason dixon line was	2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
uh criticize the methods used and and analyze it figure out what worked and what did did work	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know im im thinking about what	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and ive ive always bought them new	6 3 1 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
with uh hair sprays or those those-	6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 6
i mean it it was probably- probably was	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot	7 5 5 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and fill pot holes and you know and	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
see somebody from california	6 3 2 4	6 6 6 4
make it so	6 6 6	6 6 6
the last	6 6	6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
and you did did have all the other junk around it	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3
and the first kind of	6 6 6 6 6	6 2 4 4 6
i do do think they can they can	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre pretty reasonable	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4
uh brought up for jury duty	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
execute anymore	6 6	6 6
you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work	6 7 5 5 2 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
what i look like what i live like	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you find almost like there there no lot line at all	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
about individuals or families	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4
that that good good news- good deal	3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
so uh they got along great	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
you know uh is able to carry a gun	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so id id	6 3 1	6 6 6
so she said whew it it for you	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6
and nobody ever showed us or anything	6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
worldwide support for for what was happening	7 5 5 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
im im trying to remember	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
he he learning the hard way	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
so theyre theyre professionals	6 3 1 7	6 3 1 6
even- even some money	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i had a dump truck come and dump it	3 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
but i feel like maybe the american people and	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
well have a good day	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6
he could he could not only um uh shoot himself	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
so uh	6 6	6 6
uh using drugs	6 6 2	6 6 6
it it it really obvious	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
are really pretty slim right now	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
the power makes it run	2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
well theyre theyre burning that diesel fuel is what it is	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that how i feel	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 4
compared to	6 6	6 6
we have have um	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
just use that as additional	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
the other	6 6	6 6
a kid in	2 4 6	3 6 6
i was working at the dallas site	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh that that that that fairly high	7 5 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
im im going to have to leave those details like what would you do about	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 3 2 3 2 4	3 1 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
it it almost like being selected for jury duty	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
there there such a	6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6
oh are you	6 6 3	6 6 3
and i think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
but uh i have have seen one yet either	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
to work as a teacher	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
from the significance of the death penalty	6 7 5 2 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 3 4 6
it was uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
but it surrounds a man-made reservoir	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
that that no secret	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
juries had any say on recommending sentencing	2 6 7 5 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
that that right um	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
oh no	6 6	6 6
that that great you know	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i did	3 6	6 6
but i do lots of outdoor sports and things	6 3 6 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and i have two children laughter-also	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
and so we said fine	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and you sometimes	6 3 6	6 6 6
the computer would fit our needs	3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
did did you use it	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
dinky do crappy	2 4 4	6 6 6
um im im not sure right in front of the fan-	2 3 1 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
to alcohol	6 7	6 6
lately i guess um uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
and theyre theyre like theyre theyre afraid that you know within a certain amount of years	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4
oh we do do uh we put too much uh responsibility on the teachers for things that are really not education	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 1 6 2 3 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
but i find attitudes are	6 3 6 2 6	6 6 6 4 6
companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home	7 6 6 6 7 2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
but um	6 6	6 6
and youre youre talking about	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
it it really scary	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
um ive ive been out of texas about ten years	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
at times there there a lot of it	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 3 1 2 6 6 6
after it it been raining for a few months	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
the various students	2 4 4	3 6 6
instead of twelve	7 5 5	6 6 6
but i do do think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
but they have the money to be able to do it	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so do you all do you have kids	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
the blow ceiling	2 4 4	6 6 6
things they could go into agricultural and	2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4
and he just has himself and his brother and his parents	6 3 6 6 3 7 2 4 7 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
uh just uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
i think so	3 6 6	3 6 6
masses you know	7 6 6	6 6 6
i know that they trained you in the language	3 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
are happening socially in the world around them and in in to- because of their	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over	6 6 6 3 6 7 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them1 was better- trying to teach them was better than have them1 taken out	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
about projects	2 4	6 6
i guess get a real laughter-job	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
three or four times	3 1 1 1	6 3 1 6
and i believe also in shooting of uh rape i mean	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4
how about how about the reverse of that	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
the way to stop that kind of behavior	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but she had she had left- called and left a message on our recorder	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
you know i- i wonder	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
to not necessarily a uniform but saying that theyve theyve got to wear	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
if they go to bandingbanning	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
i do do really like to put a lot chemicals on it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
could could mean life	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
and the young people are overly impressed	6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
interestingly some of the information ive ive been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh	6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i do do know how i feel about that	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
even uh even in the worst crime areas in burlington	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
what was this project	7 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
but she she she she usually pretty good	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
see that that how	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean i	6 6 6	6 6 3
i just do do know how much theyll theyll	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
what they did was	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
were were looking at that now	7 5 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
ive ive heard of it	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
well im im a im im a practicing vegetarian	6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6
you know and	6 6 6	3 6 6
and then the bins are collected	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
but it turns out my mom said that	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
i think i think that that that true	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i ca ca	3 6 6	6 6 6
there really is is much to say after	6 6 6 6 7 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
of the high roofs	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 4
you know because they figure well you know sure i- i get	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and i started doing that at work	6 3 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
there there certain areas where uh the crime is focused	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4
detroit worked awfully hard on on stopping car manufacturing in this country	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
it just	6 6	6 6
unless the legislature will do something	6 2 4 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4
i suppose any items that you have	3 6 7 5 3 1 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know everybody would be just be scared to death	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i would not i mean	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you hear that	3 6 3	6 6 6
and one of the things that that in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to	6 7 2 4 4 3 1 2 3 1 1 1 2 4 7 5 5 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
we got to do this	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6
but it definitely would give	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
if you make it where it it not something	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6
it it like a family thing	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 6
kids did did fit in right then	2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
he picks up a stick and goes bang	3 6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
this is just something on the side	3 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
im im a big baseball fan too	3 1 2 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 4 4 4
shell them1 or at least	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4
and that that maybe what you were talking about	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh you know than even- having a unanimous decision	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
but that was in a more of a	6 3 6 6 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so he had to kind of get used to laughter-us laughter-when laughter-we first	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 4
i mean when they see each other you know they just love each other to death-	6 6 6 2 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it such a big area	3 1 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 4 6
murder this year	2 4 4	6 6 6
got married	6 6	6 6
uh in my children children case it was	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
you better believe it	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 3
i do do think it was an all california baseball	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well when uh we lived in san antonio	6 6 6 7 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but they do do	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and some of them were disastrous	6 7 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
yeah it just seemed a little	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4
um yeah	6 6	6 6
the kinds of things we do so we make them1 better	2 4 4 4 3 2 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
that that uh	6 6 6	3 1 6
well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 2	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6
the rangers have a have a pitching problem	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it	6 3	6 6
well even the you know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
rather than sitting there	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
the huntley brinkley report was quite excellent	2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i guess i- i draw a laughter-hard laughter-line	3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
a ridiculous of money to get	7 5 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
id id id id rather have baltimore with the home town atmosphere	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
look at your pattern	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
now i signed up for a different one now that that only two nights a week because i am getting kind of	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3
you know	6 6	6 6
he you know the more complex your structure	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4
it seems to have worked uh	3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 6
oh you can	6 3 6	6 6 6
she gave it laughter-to laughter-me	3 6 3 6 3	6 6 2 4 4
no uh	6 6	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i knew it was there	3 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
uh per capita	7 5 6	6 6 6
or an occupation that the results are not as tangible	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i i i feel that uh	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
about three years old	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
my dog last german shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too	3 1 1 1 1 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 3 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and boy it is really nice	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
that that what i one thing i like about ti ti is that they are are overly strict about what you wear	3 1 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4

they just molest-	3 6 6	6 6 6
nobody has nobody has a non	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
that that exactly it	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
it was a poignant humor	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
and i was the subordinate	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
so it it getting close	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
the drug tests assure theyre theyre accurate	2 4 4 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
you have to sign a	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
well the last two i saw him in one of those back to the future part three deals and that was crummy also	6 2 4 4 3 2 3 2 7 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
i admire someone that can do that you know	3 6 3 1 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
the company doing drugs	3 1 2 4	6 6 4 6
i know down here the school are	3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and the sacrifice is is that great	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
well that that something	6 3 1 1	6 3 1 6
and maybe- maybe let them have some mock	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and my husband is the kind of guy he he	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6
i hope it it recording	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
the uh	6 6	6 6
because some of the teachers i know wear	6 7 2 4 4 3 2 6	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6
well um how long do you cook the meatballs	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
but theyre theyre suppose to work really well	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
on the one hand theyre theyre not he he not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
so she took the cat to the vet	6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and so idiots as we were	6 6 7 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know and i do do think any politician politician gonna gonna do that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6
that would have been stupid	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
well that that great	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
my husband and i	2 4 7 3	3 6 6 6
i ca ca remember what it it called	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
the lexus uh really	3 1 6 6	6 6 4 6
they say the roots have developed	3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
listen to it all the time	6 6 3 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 4
so they gave them to us	6 3 6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6 2 4
i do not know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh sure	6 6	6 6

and that that that what theyre theyre called to do	6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i think that would be real interesting for people to do	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6
he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
that that a lot	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
i mean a lot of yard around your house now in denton	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 1 1 1	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 2 4 6 2 4
i talked to one in california	3 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 4
there is is a section in plano you can really move to without getting caught	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
you asked me that i would would have been able to tell you	3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
on the days they do trash or something like that	2 4 4 3 6 2 4 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i personally would not want to laughter-go	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and they	6 3	6 6
because1 i know him	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
you know with a with as	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
my fiance is selling	3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4
it seems like there there no room in jails to put them1 in jail	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but it i think it varies	6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
i did did notice it	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
but it it just you know leak leak leak everywhere	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year	7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 7 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
a professional mother a person	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
and it it a picture	6 3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
so we took two kids with us	6 3 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and they wo wo	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and okay this this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
hi dana	6 3	6 6
how is texas about keeping your children out of public schools	6 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1	6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
so i thought that was interesting	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
as far as im im concerned	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 1 6
id id i bet	6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6
trying to	6 6	6 6
and theyre theyre basically almost all three two	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i mean they just find your name	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 2 4 4 6 6
get real confusing	6 6 6	6 6 6
a guy who was there as a uh foot soldier	7 5 3 1 1 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
there there plenty	6 6 7	3 1 6
i forget what that that called with	3 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i do do think it it as bad as la la either	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
changing them out you can keep a car for a long time	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
things like i had the flu last week	2 4 3 2 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4
it it a long process	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 4
theyre theyre all three two	3 1 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 4
the work force with the the salaries that	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it eighty	3 1 2	3 1 6
and um	6 6	6 6
it it not not a real functional situation anyway	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
oh goodness	6 6	6 6
single parent families than there are	2 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
i started reading and got about sixty pages into it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
well i had	6 3 6	6 6 6
in the bible it says uh	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6
uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes	2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4
and do it you know	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
a solid family life that they need to have	7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
it was just terrible	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
once theyre theyre past esol esol esol esol they get out	6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 3 3 6 6 6 6 6
i think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3
um sometimes it would be um	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
i do do think there there so much of a problem there	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
well the	6 6	6 6
if you look real hard	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that really great	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
much knowledge	2 4	6 6
and i wear anything from jeans when im im feeling really casual	6 3 6 3 6 2 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 3 3 1 6 6 4
i would expect people	3 6 6 2	3 6 6 6
and it is a bulb	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone	7 5 2 7 3 7 5 3 7 5 2 4 4 7 5 2 3 1 2 7 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
more of a problem	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4
or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you can get a head start on it	3 6 6 7 5 5 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3
that that great	3 1 6	3 1 6
and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6
if if it it not then i wo wo	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
they destroyed it	6 6 3	6 6 3
the ones i knew you know always chose the red cross because they did did do anything	2 4 3 2 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
that- i mean you know that that the way i felt about it	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
it is	3 6	6 6
i like classical music	3 6 2 4	6 6 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
because it it	6 3 1	6 6 6
it is actually prohibited	3 6 6 6	6 6 4 4
ever since that time i just do do watch	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
some knowledge in the subject	7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
i got a degree from twu twu twu	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6
and it seems to me right now that there there not	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6
oh possibly four	6 6 2	6 6 6
they just made them1 look fancy	3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and it it a commitment	6 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
well you see i think that that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 4
and i just	6 3 6	6 6 6
i agree	3 6	6 6
and and they are doing that in a number of schools	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
well yeah	6 6	6 6
i just went and bought a honda	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it	2 6 6 6 3 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
weve weve had a garden gosh for years and years and years of some size you know	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 2 4 6 4 4 6 6
that that interesting	3 1 6	3 1 6

i sort of weird for me to have had one too	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
if someone is from a foreign country	7 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4

i think that that an ideal situation	3 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 4
and that that enough for us	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
he thought that was great	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and so they told me about this project	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i i think youre youre right	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
not give anybody a chance to beat them1	6 6 3 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6

weve weve got	6 6 6	3 1 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
well that that before my time actually	6 3 1 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
it was	3 6	6 6
oh jeez	6 6	6 6
and they uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i want to tell you something	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
where are you	6 6 3	6 6 6
actually it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
we uh	3 6	6 6

well my mother was on the school board	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i- i think this is a little	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
it does	3 6	6 6
uh dodge	2 4	6 6
where they put centers and	6 3 6 2 7	6 6 6 6 6
phenomenal amount of	2 4 4	6 6 6
i had a uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i had to work twelve hours that day	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 4 4 4
that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
there there was the whole thing was put together	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that must have been hard on him because he he just a person	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
that makes such a difference	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
live in	2 4	6 6
but that that uh theyre- theyre theyre so close	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
they have that down there that	3 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
but the taxes alone there lake greenbelt	6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 3 4 4 4 6 4
we we planted like twice as much this year because	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i mean i did did work	6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6
because1 if she fell in then id id of been	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
every everybody makes the obligatory trip to stonehenge	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and the whole	6 7 5	6 6 6
and i could could find a nursery that had any of them left	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 3 2 3 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
we camp year round	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
who who been to trial and has been in and out of jail you know basically a a three time loser for the twelfth time	3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
and went up there one day	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3
up on	6 6	6 6
they that had	6 6 6	6 6 6
and then i made	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it it you know	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
left the team you know	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and it sounds sort of funny	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
then the second month they	6 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6
he does have some real	3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6
that was very good	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
it it a two story	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
so that was a really high high status position	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
especially compared with uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean it it sad	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6
you know weve weve got	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
acquired this animal	6 3 1	6 6 6
uh um	6 6	6 6
ive ive never	3 1 6	3 1 6
ive ive heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that	3 1 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 2 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
a built in	2 4 4	6 6 6
and you know now were were	6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6
no real question about that	2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 4 6
probably about four days ago	2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 4 6
and theyre theyre cheap	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
it is	3 6	6 6
i guess so	3 6 6	6 6 6
but theyre theyre not condemning you	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
high-level reports	2 4	6 6
something with these kids	3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
i do do do it anymore because1 it it just too fattening	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
people just really just	2 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
but it it it it got people singing	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i uh	3 6	6 6
uh falsely accused	2 4 4	6 6 6
do a stint	6 7 5	6 6 6
so you do do have much choice there	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4
i agree	3 6	6 6
but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
but ive ive heard about him	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
but i guess overall because i guess im im not associated with what	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6 6
that that that that	6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6
and we struck an agreement with the people theyd change	6 3 6 7 5 6 2 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
or much more than they already are	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the	6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3
so i would would have to worry about which car was gonna gonna run	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
in europe they seem to have mentality	6 2 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and then the girls	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
it had detached it had a drive- detached garage	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and it just	6 3 6	6 6 6
leave the details up to somebody else huh	6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
because uh theyre theyre the ones thatll thatll probably have to uh	6 6 3 1 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
but they um	6 6 6	6 6 6
um originally i had planned	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
was reasonably unknown	6 6 6	6 6 6
anyway we	6 3	6 6
so it it just a different world	6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i i must admit that the production costs of	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
that is happened	3 6 6	6 6 6
it it just one big pr pr campaign that	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i know amway	3 6 2	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
mothers to be home with their kids	2 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
and every year they get thrown out	6 2 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 4 6
that uh	7 5	6 6
she likes the chicken and fish	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4
because1 there there	6 6 6	6 6 6
something like that	3 2 3	6 6 6
you laughter-know when their parents come	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
and then theyre theyre going back to korea and japan and hong kong	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
that is a pretty big change	3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
ill ill watch them1	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
a few years ago	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
you know the revenue stream went to another state	6 6 7 5 5 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know theyre theyre supposed to be regulated because we have a	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
i saw one i thought was crummy	3 6 7 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i think there there been	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 1 6
i think so	3 6 6	3 6 6
small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6
the computer was supposed to have two	3 1 6 6 6 6 7	3 6 6 6 2 4 4
it is	3 6	3 6
oh boy	6 6	6 6
it depends on the location	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
you know it it it a i think it it a mistake to move large agencies like that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 2 4 4 4 6 6
and done with it	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
theyve theyve been living there for about three months now	3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well that makes sense	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
six thousand	2 4	6 6
all the recycling stuff	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
am scared of laughter-capital laughter-punishment i guess	6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
well when we came back from the outer banks we came up due norfork and	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 4 4
because youve youve got such a mixed bag there	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
and theyve theyve belonged there forever	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
and it works great	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
and she was set free too just in two examples in texas recently	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
it it not like a normal urinalysis	3 1 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
uh i guess ive ive had to return something	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
that that enough to make anybody paranoid	3 1 2 4 4 3 2	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
that that	6 6	3 1
i ca ca think of any examples	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that was still when things were	3 6 6 6 2 6	6 3 6 2 4 6
the only opposition to it really was that it was you know	7 5 5 5 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
you know youre youre nearly a hundred percent	6 2 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and drunk driving is a good one	6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
it it religion couched as politics	3 1 7 5 5 2	3 1 6 6 6 4
uh how do you feel about it	6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 3
and then they they also do testing there	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6

the first direction that i can see	2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well that that that that neat	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric	6 7 2 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
a lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located	7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
um yeah	6 6	6 6
we we could could survive in a system- in a	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3
and uh	6 6	6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
really there could be um	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
instead of	6 6	6 6
and i keep telling my husband that	6 3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
a little surprised they did did get a change of venue on that one	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 3
do they teach them1 in school right now where she she at about drugs	6 3 6 3 6 2 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4

you bet	3 6	6 6
and they had to kick	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something	2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
it really is	3 6 6	6 6 6
i think somehow you have to separate the revenues	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4
a friend	7 5	6 6
that i do do have any first hand experiences about	3 1 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4 4
but we just you know we walk into the video store	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
the latest movie ive ive seen that i thought was fantastic was dances with wolves	2 4 4 3 1 2 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
there there just no deterrent	6 6 3 1 1	3 1 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and uh it it it it all on	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
every time i get taken to an auto repair place you know every time i go i get taken	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 3 2 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
well i wo wo say they did did try it	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
and when youre youre ready to get another car just pay cash for it	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 6 3	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
it it not recyclable	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
so i really have just a thirteen year old at home	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
and he just could not eat it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh no	6 6	6 6
oh baths	6 7	6 6
in a while get around to it	6 7 5 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
well when i was in england years ago and i went to to like shakespeare shakespeare and you know stratford-on-avon and all that	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 7 6 7 2 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
get my degree in the in the field that i was in	6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
but i guess because theyre theyre highway miles	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
that that very true	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
administrative association	7 5	6 6
uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 2 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6 6
and stuff	2 4	6 6
is it	6 6	6 6
they set back drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 7 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 7 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
been able to get some good players and come around	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
eight times as many	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
in a lab- as a lab technician	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 1 6
average guys ca ca really go out in the in the garage and	7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
that that that that got to be the most common thing that people	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
hebert laws a flute player he he a jazz flute player	3 1 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 4 6 6
it it very prevalent	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
that that one thing they do do do is is drug testing while youre youre on the job	3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 2 4
they underestimate how much	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
the men have to be convinced of that	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i was really happy that i was able to do that	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand	3 6 7 2 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
do you know	6 3 6	6 6 6
they uh	3 6	6 6
when i was single we used to always cook around the house	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
they do do want you on the jury	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
so um	6 6	6 6
they said it was really riveting	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
it just	6 6	6 6
uh i ca ca understand why anyone would abandon this dog though	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6
so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and there there that sense of i have now opened my door	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
my um	6 6	6 6
you call	3 6	6 6
uh yes	6 6	6 6
one year i did did put anything on	2 4 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
if i ever get the hankering to see something ive ive got	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 3 1 6
our organization is doing something else tomorrow- on monday	2 4 6 6 3 2 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
like attack one of the planes because they were protesting uh	6 6 7 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
it just dries up shrivels up and dies	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
as each employee comes in	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 4 4 6
i mean not because of the vote- i mean im im not thinking of moving there because of the voting	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
uh there there so much- there there so much of a return from prison- to prison	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
i do do see any problem with with	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
and space is is not your own space	2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
pardon me	6 3	6 6
coke machine up there	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 3
uh necked	2 4	6 6
and let	6 6	6 6
camping in the rough	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
is is that nice	6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6
that that of course that is certainly true	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
im im actually in a mall calling	3 1 6 6 7 5 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
we just have to	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it gave folks some	3 6 2 7	6 6 6 6
we sell the paper back to	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 6
that uh	2 4	6 6
do you ever keep any of your stuff	6 3 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know used to drop mice in it	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever	7 5 5 5 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
a death uh or uh	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
on a lot of issues are more liberal than republicans	6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
i find i read very little	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
one of the greatest and massive things in in the world	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
plowed through the whole	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
as far as the you know the deficit that that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4
so she she tired when she comes home in the afternoon	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
i really liked it	3 6 6 3	3 6 6 3
but kentucky we use to have severe i mean just real cold cold winters	6 6 7 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going to sign him	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 6
it it like	6 6 6	3 1 6
outside of um	6 6 6	6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
he may be retired	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
starts with the one person that	6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 2 4 4 6
well i know i spent hours in the gym	6 3 6 3 6 7 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and she found out after that	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 4 4 4
we have such an affluent -society society that i wonder if if we	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6
and sometimes those twelve people could care less	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh no	6 6	6 6
but he says there there plenty of room up there for a room	6 3 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 6
that that really cute	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
two weeks ago	7 5 6	6 6 6
where you where you live	2 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
and i	6 3	6 6
it it that high	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
so it it the government that that mandating it to a certain extent	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
i know	6 6	6 6
there there mosquitoes	6 6 2	3 1 6
which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit	3 7 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
and the first thing the the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in	6 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
probably more widely abused	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i think that it it it one thing	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i- i was	6 3 6	6 6 6
and it broke like in the middle of nowhere	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
banking and	7 2	6 6
i do do know how old you are	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
they just kill you	3 6 6 3	3 6 6 3
the things that work in psychology other the years that theyve theyve proven to work	7 5 3 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 1 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6
well that that the way to do it	6 3 1 7 5 5 5 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and those are fun	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4
you you have to support the people that are there	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4
and she stayed home and raised her kids	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
went to new orleans for four days and came back late last night	6 6 2 4 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that some of them1 are known	6 7 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh in most states as long as you are are	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6
now i do not want to sound like an old fart	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i do do know which ones	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i can see it being done	3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
then he	6 3	6 6
get accomplished you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and he he motivated because	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
well i just finished just i just finished one last night	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that was part of that trilogy that uh	3 6 2 4 7 5 3 7	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
that would be certainly be a deterrent	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
and they overflow into the	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
right well	6 6	6 6
that it would just have to be a hobby	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well i did did know that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
languages that do do have anything written yet	2 3 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it uh something were were really irritated about around here or some people are really irritated about	6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
im im sure he is	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
i mean i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
im im not as interested- you know	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
one time i -remember	7 5 3 7	6 6 6 6
well like there there two sides to it i guess	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
because if if i	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3
in the long term effects of the of the war	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and so she she going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 3
i know of	3 6 6	6 6 6
or seventy	2 4	6 6
you know groups	6 7 5	6 6 6
theyre theyre probably still in deliberations on it	2 4 6 6 6 7 5 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
so you do do have anything right now	6 2 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6
this is kind of an unusual use for	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6
oh space gee that was the one i was trying to wade through was space	6 2 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 4
it it like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while youre youre gone	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 3 2 4 7 2 4 4 4 3 1 2	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
and theyre theyre saying how there there going to be a lot more parking for the stadium	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
a lot of people have the opinion that	7 5 2 4 6 2 4 4	3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
good grief these are well fed cows	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well that was my experience	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
and many times ive ive seen on trials they have on tv tv	6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
and theyve theyve gone to charleston a couple of times and had a real good time	6 2 4 6 6 3 7 5 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
well actually i do do think theyre theyre out of line	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
um who has nothing to hide	2 3 2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
being mister cowboy	6 3 1	6 6 6
that that always a good question	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
theyve theyve theyve theyve relinquished their parenting	6 6 3 1 6 2 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 4
nobody can have this many relatives	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
i i see that as being a a a change um	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
there there you know ti ti is here oscar mayer	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and lawn additives and that type of thing	2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and i was having to walk along the highway	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
youre youre a sophomore	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
at at the end	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
so what what the prevailing	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
im im going to quit as soon as school	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you have have got enough nerve to say	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
strong feelings about changes to be made in the uh jury system do you	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6
to even have the kids uh	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and i think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4
in order to circumvent the law though	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 2 4 2 4 6
were were gonna gonna	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
theyre theyre in	3 1 6	3 1 6
last spring	2 4	6 6
and someone someone got to do it and be able to do it right	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
and there there a notion that somehow	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 4
so ill ill try that	6 3 1 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i did did do it	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
well they pushing the death penalty	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6
that that something that demands my time	3 1 1 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 4
i mean she actually asks to go out	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
when i was teaching school i saw many so many kids that were at loose ends	6 3 6 6 2 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
so i was really familiar with a lot	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
i did did realize a cow one cow produces that much manure	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
oh now come on	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i thought gosh id id probably have nightmares for the next six months	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
and it it time to go	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
it it beautiful	2 4 6	3 1 6
it it great	3 1 6	3 1 6
so that would kind of give you	6 2 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
and i think the pirates will go	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
dismissal or treatment or whatever	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
he finished everything except the chimney	6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 4
however i think the area that i live in it it not	6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
let let see	6 6 6	3 1 6
it it great while theyre theyre really little	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6
and she she the kind that goes for convenience over anything else	6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
do you like to bake at all	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
it it just kind of convenient	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4
new york city for example	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but you see president bush is telling them rebel you know	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
gave us this car	6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6
say okay youre youre convicted	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
well they might tell you it it random	6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
one my daughter went home to visit my mom for a while	7 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
she she had it for i guess three years now	3 1 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
how- how do you view this whole subject	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but say	6 6	6 6
that that that that on our list of things to see	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 4 3 1 6 6
but he was uninsured	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre very bold it seems	2 4 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
the truth	7 5	6 6
like the customer customer always right	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
i think that they thought that there was a lot of	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 6
evidently got old uh	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
we give everybody pretty much the benefit of the doubt	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
so i guess the worst problem i ever had with	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6
and virginia and	2 3 2	6 6 6
well weve weve got in texas we have a female governor	6 6 6 6 6 2 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
a person should go to the school that school all four years	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
oh no-	6 6	6 6
so i can get my hands dirty	6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 2 4 4
do you	6 3	6 6
one of those	6 6 6	6 6 6
magically shot into the present time	7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean you know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i have the papers and everything	3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i enjoyed speaking with you	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
i married into a military family	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
were were going to get off	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
they maybe they need to uh help promote that more	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 4 4 4 4 4 6
i- i think some of these people that they claim as middle eastern experts do do do do have a clue sometimes	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 3 1 2 4 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 3 1 6 2 4 4
to hell with it	6 7 6 3	3 6 6 3
it seems like we are doing it here forever	6 6 6 2 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
when i was in college i i enjoyed teaching	6 3 6 6 2 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
but when we did have it uh we that that what we usually watched	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 2 4 4
i- i do do consider mexican people	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to frederick that as it does to go to the to ballpark in memorial- in uh baltimore	6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
a uh major undertaking i guess uh	7 5 5 5 3 6 6	6 2 4 4 6 4 4
and yourself-	6 3	6 6
we found something interesting at crest oldsmobile cadillac up there on central expressway	3 6 3 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
of uh	6 6	6 6
you know that that going to be the safest place to be	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
and let let face it	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
that uh	6 6	6 6
of a contest	7 5 5	6 6 6
and there has to be some sort of punishment	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane	6 7 5 5 2 4 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
im im a kind of uh	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
have have been up there	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4
a pontiac uh believe six thousand	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
there there anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 2 3 6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
that true true	6 6 6	6 6 6
at this point we only have one board	6 2 4 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they make it as easy as they possibly can for you	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6
uh that	6 3	6 6
are you guys golfers	6 3 1 2	6 3 6 6
it should begin and	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
bad to test just everyone-	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4 6
with more brick when there were other homes that did did have any	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
and then tonight this woman called	6 6 3 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
it it called dublin	3 1 6 7	3 1 6 6
i mean i just go ahead and take it to the	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
you know she worked too	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and that was the thing i could could figure out because he would go	6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
because once it went to the the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
going to	6 6	6 6
really about anything that that going on	6 6 3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
now that that that that just unbelievable to me	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus	6 2 4 3 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
um a lot of the the things that are going on in today today society	7 5 5 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 4 4
communications that	7 6	6 6
it seems anymore uh a movie can not be considered good unless there there just some	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 4
you know had had been tested	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
a lot of times i eat	7 5 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean i might not have that much	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
so you really not making a sizeable profit	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
think we can handle that	6 2 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
but that that not by my choice	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and he said mom you need to read it after i get finished	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
that seems like youve youve thought this through quite a bit before	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and uh keep uh the patriots in the new england areararea anyways	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh but now that that just what they said	6 6 6 3 1 1 1 2 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
i think that that more realistic than going making them1 go in the peace corps	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
so maybe that that part of the reason it it not so bad down here	6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
along that same line	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
i watched last weekend	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
all with all the perks that weve weve given them	6 6 7 5 5 3 1 1 7 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
and they lasted from you know about	6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
they they do do they ca ca fetch you know	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6
am i actually	6 3 6	6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
tornado type	2 4	6 6
uh the defense with bruce smith- bruce smith there at linebacker there	6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
and everything everything nice and clean	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and so im im still	6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6
i hate to go into a	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
just because you know a subject matter does does mean you can teach it	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6
we used to have a honda accord	2 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh i just ca ca do those and the lizards and the	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 7 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
got a mix	6 2 4	6 6 6
it does does really gain anything	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4
uh for instance uh well you know i am just not taken as seriously you know at professions	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 2 4
thirty cents a liter	3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6
and uh	7 5	6 6
i was a married person	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
the uh lady	7 5 5	6 6 6
and in nineteen fifty	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
i have never been able to make it through any of michener michener work	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i- i know here in dallas that theyve theyve just instituted in the last couple of years a um a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
i think he he sick	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
by richard fugate	7 2 4	6 6 6
and you know itd itd blow it up north	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
and it did this	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
i was just wondering were you in sac by any chance	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
i think im im fed up with trite	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
he had already carried a ladder outside	3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
uh uh uh uh uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
just a little	6 7 5	6 6 6
you know that you have a lot more	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
is about the same as mine	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
it it true	3 1 6	3 1 6
i id id heard something stranger	6 3 1 6 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6
um well uh partly due to ownership	6 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and new york	7 2 4	6 6 6
but on the other hand	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
in fact i think there there two of them1	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
make enough noise but	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller	2 4 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
so i do do see	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
uh car repair place also	2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4
again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice	6 6 3 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
it was done for me after a while	3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and they should study it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
they yeah they they did they stuck right to their goals	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i had a	3 6 2	3 6 6
and then uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
a lot of the	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6
well when i was you know when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3
and and some kid goes out and gets the kid	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
but down	6 6	6 6
i mean i ca ca be real you know i can not tell you why i feel this way	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
but if do do work with them as a parent	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
aware of what all	6 6 3 7	6 6 6 6
i think a lot of things are not made as well	3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
um wrongly	6 6	6 6
because1 he was in it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
you know upset at court	6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 4
you know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
especially what youre youre out on the highway	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
that it would be	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well that that pretty scary	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i i think of the peace corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when	6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 7 2 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 3 1 1	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
maybe it was during the interview	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
met my husband	6 3 1	6 6 6
oh they must they must have changed then because it used well	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 2 4 6
police patrols trying to	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6
i did cut down a lot	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors	6 3 6 7 5 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
i i i i tend to read like only out of a couple	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
im im sorry the commonwealth of pennsylvania	3 1 6 7 5 2 3	3 1 6 2 4 6 4
right now in verbalizing	6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4
but the changing is taking	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
i i listened	6 3 6	6 6 6
the older side you know i- i- i just feel like uh when i start talking about benefits i talk about	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 4
oh my word	6 6 6	6 6 6
like itd itd be a good movie- movie	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
we do discuss a great deal the miniskirt miniskirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
well as a substitute teacher for a year i	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and get more money to these people that desperately need it	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
just kind of mulch it	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 6
uh always	6 6	6 6
there there uh no question	6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6
our judicial system is in such	2 4 4 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 4
how would you go about changing it	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
go ahead	6 6	6 6
i mean you know what it it like here	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
within our family we have said	6 2 4 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
uh most of it is from the radio uh and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon	6 2 4 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 2 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 2 4
and theyre theyre writing the whole time	6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and had just left her few minutes in the front yard	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
i felt like with visa and mastercard and american express you did did need another one	3 6 6 6 3 7 2 7 2 4 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
and he looked at	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
it would make me sick	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
for like three months	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
did you smoke when you when you were pregnant	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
some reason during the night	2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
they know who you are	3 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6
oh i just saw one on the video	6 3 6 6 7 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that that you would know more about it	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 6
but i know there are some fields where it it really not necessary	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
i wonder sometimes	3 6 6	6 6 6
so that that what they need	6 3 1 1 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
it it one story	6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6
you know that that a matter of concern to me too	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 4
i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
it it called the missionary training center in utah	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
are having a big effect on the social changes	6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
my employer does not do that um	2 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
what was one of the latest ones that youve youve seen actually	7 6 7 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
you know in the past	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
well did did kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
uh in our economy or in our system	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
theyre theyre social services	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
excuse me i see it being done	6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 4
time immemorial	7 5	6 6
i think that that a lot more realistic	3 6 3 1 7 5 6 6	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
a hundred and fifty	2 4 4 4	3 6 6 4
ive ive heard it it wonderful too	3 1 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6
well put it back	2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6
they have a real big thing here	3 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre up in the top	3 1 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6
do you have	6 3 6	6 6 6
and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time	6 3 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 3 6 1 6
it it pretty typical	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
they went to interview them1	3 6 6 6 2	3 6 2 4 6
oh exactly	6 6	6 6
we had the cat first	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
a guilty verdict if the facts warrant	2 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
one year public service for everybody	7 5 5 5 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 6
you know full cash price	6 2 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4
and i think theyre theyre working on building a jogging track and some other things	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
but i heard it one time	6 3 6 2 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
turning around just now you know trying to be rectified	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
so that that kind of	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i was walking	3 6 6	6 6 6
for example was the guy provoked	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
the mormon church	2 4 4	3 6 6
it seem like it be just the opposite when you get	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6
roughly right	6 6	6 6
simple as that	6 6 3	6 6 6
but i think that might be a violation of someone someone rights	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4
i mean they have have the all they have are mesquite- uh mesquite	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 3 2 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
or sports illustrated	2 4 4	6 6 6
and there there this montessori school that that nearby	6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
like in yours it it pretty	6 6 2 3 1 6	6 3 6 3 1 6
and shed shed just lay there on that step and just you know cool off	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
mainly mine and my husband-	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
the ability to ask that	3 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6
is it up to the	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
that that	6 6	3 1
can you go into	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
a positive indication of drugs but there there not really there were were really any there	7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i think it it an excuse to do nothing	3 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 3	3 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 4
i do too	3 6 6	6 6 3
i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
well right now theyve theyve got a	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote	7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
you know house trained and everything	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4
and perhaps the reason that good came out of the mid east war is because we had the experience of vietnam	6 6 7 5 5 2 7 5 5 3 1 1 1 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh disciplining a child	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and and i notice the the a terming	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know get a replacement part	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
the death penalty	2 4 4	6 6 6
some of the young men and women	7 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well it will make it will make them taste better im im sure	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
i was hoping iran was going to take	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive got the every day ive ive got to uh read to kindergartners	6 6 6 6 7 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4
well it it an italian um	6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
and of course im im a baby of the old school	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
do they do it with newspapers newspapers as well	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
anything can be obtained from anybody anybody	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
it it may be tough	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and they have twelve children	6 2 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4
he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together	3 6 2 4 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
want to dress too tacky because youre youre going to be in the same room with laughter-them	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
so i said well it just crossed in the mail	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
you double your crime	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
in her generation	2 4 4	6 6 6
and you just have to keep buying them	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
what what that	7 5 3	3 1 6
and i maybe watched it for a week	6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
but on the east side of the house it runs fine	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4
these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
well die or whatever	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i was	6 3 6	6 6 6
it it it amazing	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i agree	3 6	6 6
and this guy is indicted on three of them	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
and so i she does does remember anything	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and there is just a	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
and the mavericks are too-	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and i probably got more nasty than i should have	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
they over tax	6 3 2	6 6 6
youll youll walk in the door	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3
it it it it still a	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
or uh	6 6	6 6
air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the n-th degree	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
course i- i like classical music	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
put up our first electric fan	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4
and it it not for me to say that theyre theyre not	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 3 1 6
i read somewhere	3 6 6	6 6 6
absolutely right	6 6	6 6
and i think it they uh	6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
they do do care about anybody	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
uh do you live in a home	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
kind of had different different ideas from what probably the majority of people have	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 2 4 6
they have	3 6	6 6
i i tried to have um	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and i thought well that that okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 3 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
boy i have to hunt them down	6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
either parent	2 4	6 6
then they sent their little	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
there there there	6 6 6	3 1 6
we put- put it on the car	3 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and he he not ready to retire-	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
take away your right to vote	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
so youre youre just as likely to	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6
so i started questioning	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
for what what cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
but the way our system our court system works	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
an emotional victim	2 4 4	3 6 6
and parrots	2 4	6 6
and then a big windstorm it would pick you up	6 6 7 5 5 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
but i i really much much like the hometown area	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
i think they have a bond with the the kurds	3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 1	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
and and some people we think of blessings as	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
because i	6 3	6 6
occasionally you know she has to	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and uh here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 2 4 4 4
what would you have who who who would determine what these people do	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 3 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 6 6 4 4
into some sort of a	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
as bad-	6 6	6 6
and programs to	6 2 4	6 6 6
a family called all day family	7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
because1 you know got get	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
that that	3 1	3 1
uh foreign cultures or even accepting them	6 7 5 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
and so i have a little more	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i remember the company my dad worked for	3 6 7 5 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
i- i especially agree that if it it an area where they could	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
parents around here just let their kids run everywhere	2 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
the little niceties like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that	7 5 5 5 5 2 7 5 2 4 7 2 7 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
you gonna gonna say you do do wanna wanna sell me this product then that that fine	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6
what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
it would run into a lot of money	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4
i am looking at it right now	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i	6 6	6 6
well i kind of think that that true too i guess because it it so under staffed you know	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
there there no doubt about the fact that when i	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
that if you take someone else else life then you automatically are giving up	6 6 3 6 3 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
we did that too	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and they have the iowa oaks	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4
and it it it sits right at the limit	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
cubes water	2 4	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
we had visited relatives in virginia not too long ago	2 6 6 7 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
but the other side of it to me	6 7 5 5 2 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
banning them1	6 2	6 6
i i just finally ended up going to see it uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean ive ive seen and ive ive had friends that have uh like uh eighty	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 7 3 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
so we	6 3	6 6
it it	6 6	6 6
i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy	3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 4
i mean if your	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
i do do think so	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and theyre theyre all fools	6 2 4 6 7	6 3 1 6 6
yeah- everybody does right	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
they learn	3 6	6 6
he wants to do we had brought his friend along was play in the tent	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
it it real pretty	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
really do do know how to live very well	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
it had people	3 6 2	6 6 6
uh you know denial of insurance for someone um	2 6 2 7 5 5 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because	3 1 2 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
for for kidney transplant	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6

how they fund whatever	7 3 7 2	6 6 6 4
i think he ought to laughter-stay laughter-indiana laughter-jones	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
constitute uh dismissal or	6 6 2 7	6 6 4 6
and uh they have a policy for uh	6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
uh we would want to invest in in private schools as theyre theyre growing- growing up because1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 6
did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children children hospital where i was volunteering	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 4 6 2 4 4 4
vehicles or whatever if they had like a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed	2 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 3 6 2 4
my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car	2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
uh an international city	6 2 4 4	6 6 4 6
the money out of it	2 4 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
and everything you worked so hard for all your life	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
she um	6 6	6 6
and she she got four kids	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
it depends on who youre youre working for and where at	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
aluminum cans	2 4	6 6
and they	6 3	6 6
i mean i do	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it it a nightmare	6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6
handicapped societies type of	7 5 5 2	6 6 4 6
a baltimore fan right an oriole fan	2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
but i also love sports	6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 4
they do	3 6	6 6
it also depends on who who cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 4
last- two years ago when all that was going on in in uh beijing	6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and ive ive got laughter-some	6 3 1 6 7	6 3 1 6 6
but why not hit the points the kid kid really interested in	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 4 6 4 6
it was it was not a bad movie	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
there was in the middle of the back of it	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6
you know how theyll theyll put the little message down at the bottom	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4
uh uh a poodle	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean there there a competition all the time	6 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4
if i if i elicit good behavior im im out in maybe five or ten	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4
but then if it turns out to generate	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
galen just does does go there three mornings a week	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
yeah social changes is that	6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and stuff like that	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
if woman woman role like we said if women women roles change drastically men men roles will too	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 4 4 3 4 6 6 4
and we did	6 3 6	6 6 6
wow that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
so let let give money to aids	6 6 6 6 2 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
this is just a	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
you know we do do listen to the radio at work at all	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4
a lot of those places are	7 5 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
we got a couple more minutes then i guess	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
i mean that that the that that the whole problem with it	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
when he was in it gun club when they done that	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
do you own a gun	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
it it it it hard	6 6 3 1 7	3 1 3 1 6
and left me with with the brand new puppy	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4
you know just like software is only given out to customers	6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
because it seems that there	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well a lot of people theyll theyll vote the way their family votes you know	6 7 5 2 4 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 6	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
it could really wind up	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
do you	6 3	6 6
there there a lot of them1 um	6 6 7 5 2 4 6	3 1 2 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
as soon as your your a graduate student they get your name	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
they i do do think theyve theyve seen a really high	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
came in and said okay	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
well it was nice talking with you	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
but theyre theyre doing a lot of research here	6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do think this place is a very good place for him	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6
so television is my main news source	6 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i am married to a wonderful man	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
rats are not my favorite animals in the world	2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i would would want to go by myself	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and of course the	6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6
if the racial make up of the group was	7 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 7	6 3 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh it it just	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
i never really	3 6 6	6 6 6
and so uh overbuilding is it- has been a real problem there	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them1 in their cages	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
i mean people do	6 6 2 6	6 3 6 4
i think it it	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
covered the subject	6 2 4	6 6 6
one likes chicken nuggets	2 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i thought he looked real good with a beard too	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
they just do do care any more	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
so i had to get it towed and then fixed	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
and you never know who is watching either	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
i i im im really im im really concerned about you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
but there are times when a child needs to be spanked	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
doling it out that way	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
upbeat school areas	7 5 5	6 6 6
you know not a	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
if it	6 3	6 6
i have	3 6	6 6
about eighteen months	2 4 4	6 6 6
of course not	6 6 6	6 6 6
i listening to a radio talk show today at lunch time uh rush limbaugh	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
can see more and more families going to it	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
but i thought okay im im going to keep an open mind here	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i did did i mean	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
when you give these people	6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 2 4
uh i live on the outskirts of baltimore	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
it just never started smelling	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
so registrations are perhaps a a problem also	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
and she she also	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
more say	7 5	6 6
if it was	6 3 6	6 6 6
i have a son and a daughter	3 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 4 6 6 4
she came up negative	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
there there about six or eight guys that we used to go out for these games	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and then you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh laws are probably stringent enough	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
um no	6 6	6 6
there there there there always music books to buy	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
but i think	6 3 6	6 6 6
he he like sixteen months old	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
actually it	6 6	6 6
such a deal	2 4 4	6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
all of those things	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
and theyre theyre no get away from me	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know you know	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i guess that would be good	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say	2 4 6 2 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
it does	3 6	6 6
but like i said	6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
that that what i do	3 1 1 1 6	3 1 6 6 6
and he says oh come on up mom	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
well not back and forth	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but you know i have have really heard much about that recently	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 6	6 6 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
did you hear about that killeen massacre or whatever	6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
canning of the pop and the beer as as well	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6
now i saw warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a	6 3 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
of uh	6 6	6 6
i think they	3 6 3	6 6 6
there there a lot of drugs	6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6
you would know the whole world would know what you were facing	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 7 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and we	6 3	6 6
i did did even know the person person name that had gavengiven me the hard time or anything	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
and they look at you crazy	6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4
that that about it	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
so ive ive been pretty lucky there	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
the uh disabled person	2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6
programs that involve the government	2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
here it it your turn you know	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and theyre theyre theyre theyre nothing but really servants for them	6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 7 2 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
because1 i do do know of any other countries that are doing this	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
i wonder where he gets it	3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
they must uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
we stayed till about one thirty	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
innocent and then theyd theyd want to be on that jury	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
but texas is	6 2 4	6 6 6
and if you try to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
you do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
during lunch hour that are shorter	2 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
two hour drive from here	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
there is not much incentive for	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4
even the generation before me	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but uh in terms of	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6
you know for a lawyer as a paralegal	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i enjoyed it	3 6 3	6 6 6
i guess i can wait another month	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 2 4 6 6
and um actually ive ive tried that with a few companies lately	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i i use	6 3 6	6 6 6
how do you know it it done fairly	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i mean um they can deal with that scale	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
it it gotten way beyond teaching	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
well youre youre talking to someone from california where it it often swimming weather	6 3 1 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 6 2 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 4 4 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh that people go into to to support drug habit	2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and in the master bedroom	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
we seem to be degenerating here	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
very much so	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh are you really	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
were were expecting our first baby almost any day	3 1 6 2 4 4 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
so what ended up happening was was a was a shift	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
we explained what we needed	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 4
would that we could	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4
i mean that that all there is to it	6 6 3 1 7 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i was a photographer before	3 6 2 4 6	3 6 2 4 4
back in the depression the ccc ccc ccc the	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6
my belief all my life i guess has been that	2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6
that that great	3 1 6	3 1 6
and and that again is a is a sort of media perception	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
i i imagine his his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
but it it merely an economic now	6 3 1 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
uh i live down in the south western part of blacksburg	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
pulled down and started over again	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
that that just our business	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
many people from uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
i did	3 6	6 6
it uh	6 6	6 6
not enough to go in to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean it it great to be well rounded and have be exposed to all this stuff	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
so my brother brother wife and	6 3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
we just	3 6	6 6
i ca ca think of the i ca ca think of his name now	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh ive ive found that you know there there an extraordinary amount of waste	3 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 4
coaching problem	2 4	6 6
think you know for a stephen	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4
good idea	7 5	6 6
write letters to the parole board and you know lawyers	6 7 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
do you have a lot of property	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and it it got	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
because if i put a lot one of the laughter-cats would had laughter-been	6 6 3 6 2 4 7 2 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
putting them in	6 3 6	6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
where we can get world news	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
does does take care of things	6 6 6 2 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 4
for which she says celsius	2 3 1 2 7	6 6 6 6 4
hip on it too i guess	6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean if i get to the library	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but i very rarely do things	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 4 6 6 4
i know	3 6	6 3
it comes a bit from the angle that the uh	3 6 7 5 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6
every once in a while	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4
because that was one thing i always fought against	6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i think-	3 6	6 6
and if it it possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
so you have a few more years	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 4
i mean so teachers- the school system system asked to do so much	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
a mock one	2 4 4	6 6 6
you have to have money for and	3 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4 6
is that how they do it at ti ti maybe	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
things that invade	2 3 2	6 6 6
what was the last one	7 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6
would would you want to see them killed	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6	3 1 2 6 6 6 4 4
they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 7 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
must have here	7 5 5	6 6 6
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
uh you-	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
and all of a sudden this bird and i have become	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
you know	6 2	6 6
that that uh one of the things i wonder about	3 1 6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
and then this other one one only a tenth of that	6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 2 3	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
he he still alive and kicking	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
toy guns look real	2 4 6 6	6 6 4 6
at a rate greater than one a day	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
they said the apparently the crime	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
that i really think	3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6
i do do you feel theyre theyre swayed more toward-	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
so youre youre	6 6 6	6 6 6
and keep-	6 6	6 6
it sure was	3 6 6	6 6 6
so there was no repercussion at all	6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 4
and my son will be	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
then it it not the time to have	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
well it-	6 6	6 6
he should have let bush should have let him finish his job	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
he he	6 6	3 1
i always balanced in the in the situation	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4
it really feels similar to this during the summer	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there there not even a person there	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 7 5 2 4 7	6 6 3 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6
and then you got married	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but um and eventually that that going to show up anyway	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i did i did did give them away	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
oh that that good	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
last couple of years ive ive done it myself	7 5 2 4 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
im just real surprised that israel stayed out of it	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6
testing they say runs	2 3 7 5	6 6 4 4
a concern of mine	7 5 2 3	3 6 6 6
because of therere so many cars	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
people you know in the work force as well	2 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
definitely a problem	6 2 4	6 6 6
well uh the roles have definitely changed	6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4
i think	6 6	6 3
just stay in your truck	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
one day my husband had the kids	7 5 2 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
he he just a civilian	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 4
i think just uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
um ive ive you know ive ive	6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 1
and not doing anything with them	6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
but i just think of her you know	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3
they feel like you know that that really all	2 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6
well it it interesting anymore	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
he uh he had a beagle that he loved	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
i mean it he goes to a a mother mother day out program now once a week	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
well actually ive ive found out that im im not going to go back to being an engineer	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and they have all these teams from	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
but they were were supposed to process it until they delivered it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6
that was it probably	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i am in i am in washington d c	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4
and she	6 6	6 6
and i thought that you know that that pretty significantly- a pretty significantly small number	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
that would be neat	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
and uh certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
along those lines as compared to what i have seen	6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
white just all different colors	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
little kids can just you know maul all over her	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
and she finally learned that you just can not do this	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the body was in good condition	2 4 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 4 4
um-hum um-hum	6 6	3 1
have your normal	6 2 4	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
urine and and or some you know	7 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
is not inclined to lose big money	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
it it	3 1	3 1
i- i guess	6 3 6	6 6 6
i mean louisiana- louisiana for a small state was- it was amazing	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 4
that that where i was	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 4
trying to get stuff ready for the table	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
like for instance say um	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
point things	7 5	6 6
because sometimes the reviews you just ca ca go by	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i guess it it fear	3 6 3 1 7	6 6 3 1 6
im im trying to think	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
working right out of their home	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
but i had to beg off from the duty	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
he broke his leg and	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
well i have five	6 3 6 2	3 6 6 6
you know special corps of	6 7 2 4 4	6 3 4 4 6
well not really	6 6 6	6 6 6
seated at table with uh non smokers i would	6 6 2 6 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
the question was um	2 4 6 6	6 6 4 6
the judicial system is aimed at the citizens	3 1 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
you say	6 6	6 6
uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
so it it self defense- you know self-defense on that point	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
and i am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 7 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
would be putting us in another vietnam situation	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
the area area dominantly three bedroom two bath	2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they do do have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
walt disney disney kind of	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
where uh	7 5	6 6
well i had a weird	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i believe	3 6	6 6
so it it not as big a deal	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
my house is gray	3 1 6 2	6 6 6 6
and maybe dancing school for a while or	6 6 2 4 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but like you say you	6 6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
im im not really sure	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and the snow all over the place	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
no doubt	6 6	6 6
it was really rough	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i just i did did think it was that expensive because1 my son was in probably a week and a half period	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
we even	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i feel	6 6	6 6
it it like white glue	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
i mean it had-	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
well and the	6 6 6	6 6 6
i guess	6 6	6 6
updated information	2 4	6 6
but theyre theyre just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it it not you know a problem	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
just uh	6 6	6 6
that that good	3 1 6	3 1 6
really count if youre youre not part of the program	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
the whole	2 4	6 6
i just think it	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
but oh	6 6	6 6
not get told for months	6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 4
how humiliating for a man to do that any man	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 4 4 4
now those are nice	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6

and parents frequently resent when you ask them	6 2 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
but i guess a lot of	6 3 6 7 5 2	6 3 6 6 6 6

my perception of the budget you know	2 4 4 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
i mean you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 4
that was good	3 6 6	6 6 6
ive ive found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call	3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
uh the roof	6 3 1	6 6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
so i then read	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i mean i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
and what it is is the pollution	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
the type of card that we need to put in it in it	2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but um we	6 6 6	6 6 6
and it still did did work	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6
on the street make any money off of it per se you know	6 7 5 6 2 4 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
they essentially	3 6	6 6
airy feeling which i liked it real well	2 4 3 1 2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
sometimes they do that	6 2 6 3	6 3 6 6
parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
it was okay	3 6 6	6 6 6
felonies on your record	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
that that usually how it it uh	3 1 6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6
and i was wondering if you	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
and i and i i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh that that true	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
splitting classes	2 4	6 6
and it it like you know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
but they were plagued they were plagued with them	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
teach them these basic skills	6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
it was overdeveloped then	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
particularly football	6 2	6 6
he will not smoke in a comfortable position you know	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
uh guns around the place	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
and and and	6 6 6	6 6 6
because our high school	6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6
they treat them and	3 2 3 7	6 6 6 6
i i was called once	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it it	3 1	3 1
that we should know	3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6
you know that is just personal feeling	6 6 3 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
well it depends on where youre youre from in texas	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
let let say another audience let let say a north american	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a a lot	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority	6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i have a hunch- i have a hunch that you know the other prisoners are are going to be too happy with him anyway	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 6 7 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 7	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
with plea bargaining	6 7 5	6 6 6
it it really is	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6

but theyre theyre not going to grab you steal your-	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
what what the big deal	7 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 4
each individual child-	2 4 4	6 6 6

laughter-which i would pick if i had a choice for laughter-myself	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i hope	3 6	6 6
oh twelve times of the year	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
it it interesting because there are real- real regional differences	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4

well as long as you accept that it is a random	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
the only reason our car industry has has gone down the tubes is because1 the japanese	7 5 5 3 1 1 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4

uh it it not president president any more	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6

are the two top ones that we have	6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and then in the spring	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
you simply have to take	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i- it seems in my experience	6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 4
we have um in california	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4
club do you	2 6 3	6 6 6
it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
do do they do do people go for a walk on the beach at night	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 6 2	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6
i like it though	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
but i mean it	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
see all the crime and all the hurt	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4

my wife used to work for frito lay	2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 6 4 6
or some things are	6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6

genius is one percent inspiration and ninety percent perspiration	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
and i think that their uh mentality as far as the way	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh it it	6 6 6	6 6 6

i do too	3 6 6	6 3 6
well make it uh make- not necessarily difficult	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and she just liked having kids	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
and so it it just really really well regulated	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4
so you can figure out what youre youre actually paying for it	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3
such a nice guy	2 4 4 4	6 3 4 4

that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum	2 7 5 2 7 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
and put it on the back and drove away with it	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 3
they just had this jewelry account	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
because of the of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in	7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
but that was great	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6

you probably wondered huh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
it just depended on what type it was i guess	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
what are you telling that student	3 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 2 4 6 4

it kill it	3 6 3	6 6 6
and that that you know that that the way they wanted to do it	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
but it was a very difficult time	6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
that that that what i think about it	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6

you know	6 6	6 6
was it	6 3	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that good i guess	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 4
like say	6 6	6 6
but but my concern is uh	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
id id id id like to go camping cross	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
it it high too	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
with the fact of even being a teacher	2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4
businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax	2 6 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
and and and uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
but it seems like	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well that that that that that that the impression i get yeah	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 3 7 6	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 2 4 4
i mean they obviously-	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
things like that	2 4 4	6 6 6
and that that probably going to increase	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
wycliffe bible translators is right here in	3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it does does seem like people are really	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know with-	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh a unanimous verdict is is required	6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 3 4 6
snow peas are up	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
she she even got she she got one dog now and the two cats	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 1	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it was just you know it was	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
ill i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later	6 3 6 3 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
so we really do do know whether there there enough fossil fuel left or there is is	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6
that that interesting	3 1 6	3 1 6
oh oh i see	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
or it wo wo make any difference if if i do do vote	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 4 6
believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
because you know you think of the original it like	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
you would have expected them to be the last ones to	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
ex-husband ex-husband	2 4	3 1

and i have two kids	6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6
we need the one extra room	3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 4 6
so that was really worth it painting his own house	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i i i mixed it	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i do do know how old you are	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 3 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and that engine i understand	6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 4
freedom from uh search and seizure	2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and she was sitting in school on a carpet	6 3 6 6 6 7 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
theyre theyre going to help you	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4 6
and the uh	2 4 4	6 6 6
there there no	6 6 6	3 1 6
some type of college uh	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4
and then they get to spend these like money	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
my dad retired from the federal	2 4 6 6 7 5	6 6 4 6 2 4
but a lot of kids	6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
i had a similar thing that ive ive	3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 4 6 3 6 1
you know men can do housework just as easily as women	6 6 2 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
women women novels set in the civil war john jakes one	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
no texas rangers	2 4 4	6 6 6
we can find out what really happened	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 4 4
well he really saved in that way	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
very true	6 6	6 6
polls now where theyve theyve excused him because there was a a definite necessity to balance the budget	2 4 4 7 5 2 3 2 6 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney	7 5 3 2 4 4 7 3 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but i think when the time comes i- i hope to have the time to really	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
mosquitoes at nighttime	7 6 2	6 6 6
weve weve weve weve got maybe- maybe	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 4
uh there there one science fiction writer named uh allen dean foster	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and back back in those days they also used to give you	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
i will bet you those are dutch iris	3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4
i mean i can understand that actually	6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and california seems to be	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
the the the that the value is in doing it well	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4
but just a little a touch of it just to say yes i am a laughter-woman	6 3 1 1 7 5 2 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
and yes	6 6	6 6
it is	3 6	6 6
i do do have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4
maybe- maybe you know maybe a little bit higher than that now	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 4
when theyre theyre young	6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6
murdered her	6 3	6 6
and uh what-	6 6 6	6 6 6
all right	6 6	6 6
well good for him	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
uh with the handicapped group will also accept those	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4
i think by putting term limitations on you could	3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
i just could- would would want to do that	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
what would be the first thing youd youd cut	7 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
it really makes you wonder what other lists youre youre on that have been made	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 4 6 6 4 6 4
i was in toledo last summer	3 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
and and	6 6	6 6
i just do do know if you know i was eighteen or whatever id id want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
there there a little sensing device	6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 4
like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4 3 1 6 6
and it seems even though you know that they got	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6
that type not much home break-ins break-ins	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
you know we	6 6 3	6 6 6
well lawyers help create that	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6
think about the field theyre theyre going to going into	6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
i do do know if youve youve heard neurotic collection	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 4
a lot of news things	7 5 2 4 4	3 6 2 6 4
well their job is to be reelected by in large	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
that that not too bad	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
in the uh	6 7 5	6 6 6
it it kind of hard to	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 6
i lived in the suburbs of saint louis	3 6 6 7 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6
at the library or someplace this past	6 7 5 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 4
and once youve youve reached the	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
and i was the one that did the least poorly	6 3 6 2 4 3 2 7 5 2	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
and then they	6 6 3	6 6 6
of something that i do do see	6 3 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6

that are not so affluent	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
like um	6 6	6 6
uh so youve youve to look- youve youve got to look elsewhere	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and then	6 6	6 6
it said the creeks will foam	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
of a lot of people from all over the country	7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i had bought these uh colossians	3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4
and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
that that good as a	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
it just depends on how well you can hide it	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
do you	6 3	6 6
but uh it it well worth it	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well uh i i do do do it as much as i should	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
hers was the first one i got	2 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
is it just that	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
uh apparently uh there there they have have uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
but i never i never heard results or anything like that	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 2 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
other than the work place where women still are being uh	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
were were in sherman	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
i think florida still uses electric chair	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
since we moved-	6 3 6	6 6 6
houston is not at all	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
and we went and took the two dogs up	6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
he had an affair	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
i mean it looks i guess kind of like uh the chevy aerostar or arrow	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the cosby show kisha knight pullman was starting a	7 5 5 3 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
and i have seen it	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
because they do do have any education	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
theyre theyre not looking for someone whose whose going to be the most reasoned	2 4 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh boy you do have a strange wiring problem there	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and it was coming out of the lights fixtures	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
you you have to work on	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
you youre youre kind of limited in what you can do there	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know theyre theyre suppose	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
that that a good way to do it	3 1 7 5 5 2 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
twelve miles or so from the	7 5 5 5 6 2	6 6 2 4 4 4
the- the new age music like with um	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i know like in my wife wife case they made her feel like the criminal	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
because it would eliminate the uh the violence	2 3 2 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
ive ive never done potato	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6
make sure it it a lot safer because1 a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
they do do uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
unless we unless the banks or	6 6 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 2 4 4
and that is it	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
susan susan you know they had you know meatless meals you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 3
adopt the metric system	6 2 4 4	6 3 4 4
it was toilets	6 6 7	6 6 6
oh you are	6 3 6	6 6 6
talking to the people again about	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
ive ive seen that in the dealership	3 1 6 3 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
little bit more than i want	2 4 4 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
or whether this is a warning signal	6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
things are getting rough out there	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 6 6
some sort of	2 4 7	6 6 6
i mean that-	6 6 6	6 6 3
but there there a lot more guys that do that one	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
we have	6 6	6 6
the whole time	7 5 5	3 6 6
they do do need to be masters of it	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 3
so we really do do have	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
sprinkler systems or anything uh start to get real expensive because there there an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock	7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
i did did even tell the apartment managers about it	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
i have have	3 6 6	3 6 6
they they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and we and we had we had almost id id say about	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 3 1 6 6
centers and things	2 4 4	6 6 6
well it it nice talking to you	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
they had it	3 6 3	6 6 6
for east texas or something	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
there are small colleges that im im sure are struggling	6 6 7 5 3 1 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
uh out	2 4	6 6
there there no love for the broncos	6 6 7 5 5 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
to see that theyre theyre not being	2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and she has	6 6 6	6 6 6
but i think	6 3 6	6 6 6
they were some groups	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
and charge me twice as much	6 6 3 6 6 7	6 6 4 6 6 4
through the system-	6 6 6	6 6 3
but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know	6 7 5 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
and i do the recycling for that	6 3 6 3 1 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
for that	6 3	6 6
and she stays in the house all day while i go to work	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 3 1 2 4
and not that much comes back to you	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
they they try new things you know	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i work at honeywell	3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
network of	7 2	6 6
so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box	6 3 6 2 4 4 7 2 7 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
because there there just impossible- impossible to keep up on everything else	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh boy	6 6	6 6
and i have to agree with that	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
because1 that all wears off	6 3 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
because that that what our society becomes	6 3 1 1 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
are you uh involved-	6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6
typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and	2 4 3 2 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
do you have a garden	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
but i	6 6	6 6
i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that	3 6 6 6 6 7 2 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 4
a big attitude problem in that store	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know the thing is that this happens	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
stores where you can buy natural products or uh	2 4 3 2 4 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
it it it it not going a	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 3
like you know around christmas or whatever	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
they did a lot of play work and stuff	3 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
the higher offices in the in the land	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
well i guess we should stop now	6 3 6 2 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6
and then	6 6	6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in mesquite who was out in six months	2 4 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 7 5 2 3 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know uh victor kiam owned the uh the patriots	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4
well here in saskatoon um	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
that that uh uh a really nice area bethesda area	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
here that i think probably need help and	2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks	2 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
but he is found guilty of the	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think that that a good idea	3 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
probably probably thing that bothers me	3 1 1 1 1 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
as if the dogs were were enough	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 3 1 6
you know whether uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
and he he he got three kids	6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
reliability of automobiles at least us us automobiles was pretty dismal	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 1
organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and	7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6
because they	6 3	6 6
i live just outside of baltimore	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4
and you know go like	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
and it	6 6	6 6
oh that that not bad	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
theyll theyll just come jump on your lap and want to be have their bellies rubbed and	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
that got pretty	3 6 6	6 6 6
you can just spot them1 because the ceiling- the roof is so high much higher	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
but i really do enjoy-	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who	3 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
his argument is that uh the ownership	3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
a unanimous	2 4	6 6
if they were were fit for the job they were hired for they did did just can them1	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 3 6 4 6 4 6
quite a few years back	2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6
what what what what really happening here	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6
they have	3 6	6 6
so youre youre youre youre kind of thinking	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
once once i was declared an alternate and i was dismissed we met with the judge	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
you look at another kind of society like the japanese	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
well i- i went to dallas um	6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
program to get them off of drugs	7 5 5 3 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well listen	6 6	6 6
if you were short on time	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 4
want to interfere with whatever theyre theyre trying to record	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
is she	6 3	6 6
what- what- that gonna gonna be like	7 5 3 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6
and now she ran for mayor	6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
that might be it	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
is the no smoking rules on airplanes and in restaurants	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
i think though	3 6 6	6 6 6
why i im im im im a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
the name the the	6 6 6 2	6 6 4 6
and i	6 3	6 6
that could be nice	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
this was in conjunction with a guy that was put in the gas chamber	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know or on probation or you know	6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6
almost knocked me down	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and then somebody said	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it snowed a little bit um	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
about half a liter	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
if i had	6 3 6	6 6 6
howd howd how did they	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i should-	6 6	6 6
you know from everything that you read and you see on television now	6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
it just was not enough to it	6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 2 6 6 6
under early bail you know	6 2 4 6 7	6 6 6 6 4
um everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
and that that it	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
sports car	2 4	6 6
i think you know if you were introduced	3 2 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and it it like	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
you know obviously	6 6 6	6 6 6
and they really treat them1 like second class citizens	6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i was in the band	3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
in fact i do do run	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
you know for the things he he done	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
and then i guess youve youve been through a couple of	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
that that probably the best thing	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
usually you use those like for frying	6 3 6 2 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
it was it was talk nice talking to you too	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
little jam box kind of thing	7 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
i would find	3 2 4	6 6 6
see were were from houston	6 3 1 6 2	6 3 6 6 6
that that it	3 1 1	3 1 6
well there there a four year colleges	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
well i feel like too on the job when you know there there men around and some of the managers are men you just	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
and you and you	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
the businesses	2 4	6 6
something something happens	6 3 6	6 6 6
the z	2 4	6 6
you laughter-know	6 6	6 6
well you have to i- you know you have to give bush a lot of credit for	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 5 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than youre youre going to make at the job	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
i like just looking at the	3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh you mean the special interest groups	6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
the thing that im im doing is taking school pictures	2 4 3 1 1 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
well sometimes you do do have any other alternative	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4
surprisingly no	6 6	6 6
i do do recall you know wanting anything in particular	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
where i went to take them1	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
and now theyve theyve located another one or	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4

does california have a	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
but i mean i think that is a	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 3
there as long as you do what i say	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
i agree	3 6	6 6
oh gee	6 6	6 6
what we learned	3 1 6	6 6 6
it it next to free because they- they pay so much of it	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 3	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
but they showed these	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
or down here in dennison	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4
and it it not	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6

i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well how do you feel about trial by jury	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
something dollars	2 4	6 6
right now anywhere between	6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4

uh not at all	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i have a	3 6 6	6 6 3
i you know go to cleveland to see them play the	3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 6 2	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
i suspect theyre theyre fairly simple because the one lady ive ive seen	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
well do do most of them1 does does just about everything now have	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4
i named her rosebud	3 6 3 7	6 6 6 4
and i think now that the weather weather getting nicer were were going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
it it like	6 6 6	3 1 6

many of those things um if theyre theyre not able to	7 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 6 3 3 1 6 6 6
put them in salad	6 3 6 2	6 6 2 4
okay then this percentage of the voters i mean the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i play softball	3 6 2	3 6 6

dislike uh	2 4	6 6
and and they all lost their jobs	6 6 3 7 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4

and date rape	6 7 5	6 6 6
poor kid was in school all day	3 1 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
anywhere is on drugs or not	7 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6

exercising for exercising exercising sake	3 7 3 1 1	6 6 6 4 6
i do do remember that feeling	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
i mean the money that theyve theyve made from the recycling program	6 6 2 4 3 1 1 2 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
im im not sure but what some of the insurance claims are are due to	3 1 6 6 6 6 7 2 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
do you smoke	6 3 6	6 3 6

but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the guys	6 6	6 6

i mean you know it it it it anyone can get out of jury just about	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	3 6 6 3 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
for local news i think we do real well where	6 2 4 3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
i think that is an excellent program	3 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
um i can definitely uh see on down the road you know when we do have kids and are getting to that age that that gonna gonna be a definite concern	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 3 1 3 1 6 2 4 4
the area i live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned	7 5 3 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
put the safety on the gun	6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
they goofed up bad on my first- on my very first bill	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
and if he did did like what you did he killed you	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
latent heat is high	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
and that was um	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
east near the eastern shore	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
im im not im im not opposed to any testing	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and the only uh	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
because1 i like to	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh i- i- i typically am not a cat person	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
and you know laughter-and it	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
but theyll theyll let you look down the hall	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and and the question is how do you forecast that	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6
he said youre youre going to get a car that that got flood damage or hail damage	2 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4
i think we are progressing	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
that that interesting- interesting concept	3 1 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6
we- that we are now doing fifty percent	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
it it like giving yourself a transfusion-	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
oh great	6 6	6 6
the school season season over	2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
the people uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and- and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 2 4
so for me it it actually a pretty good topic	6 6 3 1 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
well most	6 6	6 6
junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick	7 5 3 7 3 7 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 2 4 4
just sure as anything the japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
might say	2 4	6 6
i do do laughter-understand laughter-this you know	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i learned to shoot when i was real little	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do think well well ever get to that	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
it it not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose	3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 3 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
and that i think is even	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4
and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
because of that smoke fumes	6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
because i was an only child too	6 3 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh heels	2 4 4	6 6 6
although most of them1 are ordered them with it	6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
mechanical engineer with t i	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
well see they have that um what is it a vet test or something like that they call it	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 6 3 7 5 5 5 3 2 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 3
open minded as well as innovative in dealing with	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6
theyve theyve had uniforms for years	3 1 6 2 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6
i did did see it	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
it was real easy to to go to town for three day three day weekend or whatever	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
but that to me was pollution	6 3 6 3 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6
you do	3 6	6 3
um trying to get- uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it it like when he was saying uh which one was recyclable which was reusable	6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
for instance	6 6	6 6
it it an eighty	3 1 1 1	3 1 6 6
command post	2 4	6 6
i do too uh because laughter-it does does make any difference uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing	7 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 6
most of them1 just want to go play	7 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that	3 1	3 1
i yeah	6 6	6 6
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
well i enjoy- i enjoy fiddling around	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
in salary	7 5	6 6
usually i am not there	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i mean it it a very very middle class neighborhood	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and some	6 7	6 6
if if you if you compare to go to a	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
uh i	6 6	6 6
once they	6 6	6 6
and uh we talked our wives into going with us one time	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
i got	3 6	6 6
i do do usually use the colors they tell me to	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 3 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then	6 6 6 6 3 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4

as they killed in washington dc dc	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 4
that they have all these after school activities for kids	7 2 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
then the system just keeps on	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 4 4
so i think a tuesday thursday might be a little bit better	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
texas i saw on tv tv the other night is the has had forty	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6

where a woman thinks that a way you know just like	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
um they they are monitored by the uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
i think that	3 6 6	6 6 6
he would wear it if he had to for his job and all	3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
that that a smart idea	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 6
greatest fad	2 4	6 6
a guinea pig	3 1 1	6 6 6
so i pack- i pack around a lot of them	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4
i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard	6 6 3 6 3 1 1 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 2 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
i do do really bother with the washington	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and theyve theyve most of them have been pretty good	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
we do do want you to go through the work and then find out that	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6
what would you do	7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
what do you call a uh	7 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6
they question my authority more	3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 4
any of the plants over on this uh	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
im im interested- are you a ti ti employee	6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
it it just it it an automatic high for her	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 6 3	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
what part of town	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
we they recycle	6 3 6	6 6 6
they supplied some uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
im im looking for another cat for them	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 3
and no lead gas was came to the pumps	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
it will give you	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
um usually theyre theyre theyre theyre bussed in to the	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
to like what you were saying that they in boston	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
not not a good quality	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 4
i just laugh	3 6 6	6 6 6
to be caught up during the day	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i i think as long as people have a choice theyre theyre going to stick with the american way	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 7 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
and now there there so many other things	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
most of the time	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3
well gorbachev gorbachev	6 3 1	6 6 6
i did did know that	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
we have	3 6	6 6
and they they passed	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and i just saw atomic bomb-	6 3 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 4 4 6
my question i guess are they really your peers	2 4 3 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
ive ive heard uh	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 2 4
but i used to work for a power company	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
so they could put this sign out front that said you know	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 6
i- ive ive ive ive got a little kitten uh that that still uh	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 4
he was the accountant	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
lab fees	2 4	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
presumed innocent	6 6	6 6
it is so cute	3 6 6 6	6 3 4 4
but it seems to me like the last	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
plug it in	6 3 6	6 6 6
were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6
with the military	2 4 4	6 6 6
is wary	6 6	6 6
and are they tested random	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
and there were chunks of carpet	6 6 6 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
i think it it	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it it it before	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
what is true and what is false	3 7 5 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
depending on the kind of drug he might be on	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre theyve theyve theyre theyre died down i am sorry they are dead now	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6
uh you know that that that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
when youre youre saying as far as the appeal	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
well you know the way the economy economy going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible	6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5 2 6 2 6 2 4 6 2 4 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but the question of	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
i do do think hed hed swum before	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
civil liberties uh stuff	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4
then we come	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh legalize drugs	2 4 4	6 6 6
so i thought man i do do know if i trust this or not	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
but uh i- i uh	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 6
we were laughter-gone	3 6 6	6 3 6
is he gonna gonna be impartial	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
i think we have a lousy school system	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but youre youre going to have to do what that person says	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i im im just now	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i think that that	6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6
thinking about buying next	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i think that that why you know children really need to	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
a company and learn from down on the bottom	7 5 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
he see he does this for a living	6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
is when i pay for something with a credit card	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
i know	6 6	6 6
how you can uh prevent that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
youre youre kidding	3 1 6	3 1 6
and what we used to do was just put	6 3 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
with a big stick	6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6
we ca ca get paid for laughter-it	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i just was not ready for kids	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4
i ive ive ive ive always heard these things	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
we did it as a family	3 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
so i said hey it it worth it	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
after i got my	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
it was called uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you just do do	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
now if i wanted to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
we got the thing down here called a shopper	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the house was gonna gonna cost less to build	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4
that that	3 1	3 1
that the	2 6	6 6
what they do uh to uh	3 1 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 4 4 4
they do do allow you to sell it do do allow them to sell it there	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
and has some people that have have have really breakthrough years	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
he he	3 1	3 1
it would definitely be gun control	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know when you get there	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
if they go to	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
that it has some influence on it	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 3
criminal record or things of this nature that	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
from being uh dumped on by uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
they used to be good	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
and do they have the death penalty there	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
also that that that that new is the uh	2 4 4 3 1 2 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
how long were we supposed-	6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6
which is a very common name	3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4
you know karen i wonder if we are recording	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
which it does look nicer	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
but i probably talked to seven or eight people	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
i mean you think about it	6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6
so i think that	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
in society at large	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
that that	3 1	3 1
virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are	3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 2 4 7 3 2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i was uh watching tv tv yesterday	3 6 6 6 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 1 6
for as long as possible	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
from what ive ive seen on the news there there a a	6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 4
i- i agree with it	6 3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3
well i went out there this spring	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper	6 7 5 5 5 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you do do	6 6 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
i could could put in enough	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
is a very significant factor	6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
i know	6 6	3 6
it it burned so completely	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i do do feel like that that as big a problem	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
but i think it it like about sixty dollars	6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 4 4 4
that that for sure	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
it it not	3 1 6	3 1 6
other kids are going to	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and usually they are	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it really does you know	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
that that forty years ago that it was already a problem	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and they pick that up on monday	6 3 6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
i think that should be left up to people who have	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
it it just to get uh motivated- motivated again	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they do do have any	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 2 6 3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6
have for anything other than your house and your children and	2 7 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
it it a difficult process you know to get rid of a a bad mayor	6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
approximately a thousand dollars	7 5 5 5	6 3 4 4
and i think that involves	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6
but in in pittsburgh	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
you can always tell whenever theyre theyre cooked if theyve theyve been dead for a long time because1 their tail straightens out	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6
as these material things	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
uh the vicksburg	2 4 4	6 6 6
you ca ca take them for a walk	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre so lazy	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and weve weve already started about you know	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
if it were were for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
and it was so pretty	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
and then	6 6	6 6
probably not not as bad as detroit	6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
before anything changes anywhere else	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 4 4 4
pushing the scales too far either direction	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
yeah there only about five or six options	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
all the other areas	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
you you said you seen no way out	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4
it it not very convenient to do	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
theyre theyre allowed to collect	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
those are	3 6	6 3
oh i did did see that one	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
when you go in there	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
children is probably the ideal to me	2 6 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
particularly what kind of music do you like	6 7 5 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
and i kept getting rid of them1	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and so it was was so bad	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 3 6 6 6 6
these things take awhile like to move up	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
but you again you need that one on one	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but i ca ca imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
uh to convict somebody	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
do they axe you for treason	6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 2 4
and they started sending those things to me again	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
took it upon itself to find a position for these people	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 3 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4
like working in hospitals	2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6
over the years	6 2 4	6 6 6
if they really wanted to vote republican they could go in the primary and say they were voting democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the republican could beat	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
but you know they had to be held accountable too	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
theyre theyre not lonely	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
we sold a refrigerator through it	3 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
i i we- we bought the movie	6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and wants to get a four eighty	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and that that true	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and financial aid	6 2 4	6 6 6
and i- i really think that were were	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
my friend	2 4	6 6

and the only thing i would consider doing a professional maybe doing that	6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 2 4 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
and they they put their shorts on there	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 4
i guess i guess im im a fan of democracy	6 6 3 6 3 1 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
it was one thing	6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6
i probably wo wo finish it until the end of the year	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
i mean theyre- theyre theyre throwing more money at it now than ever before	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
not much else we do laughter-for vacation really	6 7 2 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
dust collectors	2 4	6 6
so car	6 6	6 6

beautiful sweater- uh	2 4 4	6 6 6
i bet you do	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6

a blood test	2 4 4	6 6 6
my mother uh was	3 1 6 6	6 6 4 6
that uh	3 6	6 6
you know by by self-proclamation	6 6 6 6 7	3 6 6 6 4
on what	6 7	6 6
but the four year old now i have i have had her since i went back to work or before i went back to work really in a home day care situation	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
for something that that limited edition	6 3 1 1 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
a lot of seafood before we moved down here	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
and i have peace of mind where he is	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
we just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
theyre theyre building it up bigger	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
and then it takes three weeks and all	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3
you know being a non	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6
well actually you have to give put them1 in there unsmashed	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
that that way out of my reach	3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
youd youd open the hood	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
that that	3 1	3 1
uh and can	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know the the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else	6 6 6 2 4 3 2 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
about baseball	2 4	6 6
i i um clean houses part-time	6 3 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
there there no way that could work	6 6 7 5 3 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
oh laughter-really	6 6	6 6
so we decided well well try in a couple of years	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4
fade into a solid purple	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
most of the body parts seem to be metric	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
is this man really guilty	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
uh and not wait until theyre theyre in high school	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
the whole thing just stinks	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
so i went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
and a lot of parents have places to go and	6 7 5 2 4 6 2 6 6 2	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
tries before i found somebody	7 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and there are parts of town here where	6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
i just feel like	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but it it bothers me from the fifties on	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
where is he from in france	6 6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4
and and sometimes you get the long term stuff	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know you ca ca get a golden retriever near water without it	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 4 4 6
and uh and	6 6 6	6 6 6
and you know as a teacher you you try to make	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4
they would have collapsed	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
i think that really helped	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
because you can do that you know	6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3
support but not completely alienate all the southern	7 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
a a variety	6 2 4	6 6 6
they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it	3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
so see i	6 6 6	6 6 6
bang-up job	7 5	6 6
all those european countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that	2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4
there were situations that um	6 6 7 3 7	6 6 6 4 4
i do do feel like i	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
the mitsubishi is real nice looking too	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
i get in my paperwork	3 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 2 4
that thing grew to be seven and a half feet	3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
oh i saw that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
that that all right with me because i do do want to stay home	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 1 6
you know screw off all the time	6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know im im isolating myself here for no reason at the moment	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
but it does mean that you	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4
i am single and female	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
this is an interesting topic	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
happier life for themselves	2 4 6 3	6 6 6 4
did did pay them	6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6
it it just a lot of fun	6 6 6 7 5 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
because1 there was	6 6 6	6 6 6
because1 they a lot of times they dial sequentially	6 6 7 5 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and the city workers uh	6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 4 6
but im im sorry i got it	6 3 1 6 3 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 4 6
very true	6 6	6 6
juror system- in a trial system without a jury	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
need to teach them1 good values	6 6 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
um to also look at the hose	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
off work with her for	6 2 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
he makes eighty thousand dollars a year	3 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that one difference	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
my husband is really good	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
who do do have children	3 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6
few are	7 6	6 6
my favorite is	2 4 6	6 6 6
that protect	3 7	6 6
i would probably get like a shotgun	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh it sure is	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well they	6 3	6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
oh i do do know cia cia cia conspiracy theories or whatever would have	7 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could	6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
and uh he	6 6 6	6 6 6
was traditionally known as russia	2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4
you know to uh achieve something	6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 4 4
well you know it- it- it it real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is i guess	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
i do	3 6	6 6
my fiance	2 4	6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh she was uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
so im im a very very light smoker	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
were were it it too small around here	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 6
and they used up two thousand of them in in the war	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4
we uh	6 6	6 6
people are just	2 6 6	6 6 6
if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6
i just think our system is overworked	3 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 6 4
you know too involved with that	6 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
plus that that such a that that not a true	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
there there this invisible barrier around me which people will will respect	6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 2 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and um but there is funding that comes	6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i think that that what it is	3 6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that was done emotionally on so many of the people	3 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well dallas uh	6 3 6	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
the simpsons	2 4	6 6
near madison um	2 4 6	6 6 6
as houston say or atlanta	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
v eight like the	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3
i mean i ca ca believe they have warnings here	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
lots of young	7 5 5	6 6 6
point blank in the face	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
and a week later we went back and picked up the computer	6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4
i have one	3 6 7	6 6 6
that that one of things one of the things i ask about	3 1 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
oh have a ball with them	6 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 6
is science fiction	6 2 4	6 6 6
and it	6 6	6 6
seems like the whole group of city employees that that raising a stink over it	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 1 2 7 5 2 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 6
the opportunity for- to forget	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
and i was so happy there	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
well i need to go ahead and and wrap it up	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
pay for	2 4	6 6
so what what the solution to that	6 7 5 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 2 6 6 4
and so it it really difficult for them to treat women as equals	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
i was was sure	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
well when uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
but to me	6 6 3	6 6 6
i guess bean bean one of bean bean big competitors is lands lands end out in uh i guess it it wisconsin somewhere	3 6 6 6 7 2 3 1 2 4 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 2 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
that that that the kind of people	6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
during the evening	6 2 4	6 3 6
i would be too	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
youre youre thirty laughter-days late	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and you by that day	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
i mean golly-	6 6 6	3 6 6
you leave a message	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
that that a hard one because1 we did that	3 1 7 5 5 6 3 6 3	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 6 4
because if you stop and think	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
i was	3 6	6 6
how about some of the	6 6 7 2 4	3 6 6 6 6
and youve youve got to pay a lot you know	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh the idea of preserving privacy for the individual	2 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
just the smell is so bad	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6
uh of	2 4	6 6
would not be uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
often times	6 6	6 6
and there is a real dichotomy in terms of	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
sort of what drove me to denton	6 6 3 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
is is	6 6	6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
and we both had to go through drug trestingtesting at the same time	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
and it was just gosh	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
like they have	6 3 6	6 6 6
i have have talked to a whole lot of black people on it	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6
and there are miniskirts miniskirts	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6
i get confused between all the which is the soviet provinces versus what are the the russian provinces versus what are	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4 4 6 7 6 6 2 4 4 6 7 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
draw my own opinions	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
you know what day	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
were were in our thirties	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 4
in the past weve weve had birds too	6 2 4 3 1 6 2 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too	6 3 6 7 5 2 3 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 2 4 2 4 4 6
that those are my words	2 3 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
have not been world powers	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4
so it it a	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and we mean it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 3
you know im im im im familiar with	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
you got service merchandise	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
surprised because1 we were talking about them the other day even before	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 3 1 6
you probably do a lot of that with	3 6 6 7 5 2 3 6	3 6 6 3 6 3 1 6
but you know it it like somebody said okay as of	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know i mean give me a break	6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6
and at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
slight you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
one one of the biggest things now is like	6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
that ca ca be good for los angeles either	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
presentable but very comfortable	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and and and i do do have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 3	6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
she can be there	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it was made to placate	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
i guess	6 6	6 6
it it a good town to just walk in	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i can watch washington news	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6

and or maybe theyre theyre unemployed	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 3 1 6
if theyd theyd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh impact machines or whatever you you can do that	2 4 4 7 3 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
i mean that that true of the presidency too	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
i almost forgot my age	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
more people think there is like	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
all the	7 5	6 6
took off toward you know just some pretty hard by the socialism	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 2 4
i do do know what you want to call them	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
im im sorry	3 1 6	3 1 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
combine that into one	6 3 6 7	6 6 6 6
well what do you think about it	6 7 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
so do you have a big family	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i think taxes are high	3 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh i do- i just do do seem to have time to sit down and read the paper either	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3
and i was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 7 5 5 5 2 6 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
uh to take to go swimming	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
like if youre youre on a prescription drug of some kind	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
in fact	6 6	6 6
theyre theyre total brick	2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6
and he he concerned about it but	6 3 1 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
how and then	6 6 6	6 6 6
and theyre theyre going to shoot through five wall and hit someone you know	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 6
and then every time you wanted to go eat	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
i have two sons	3 6 7 5	3 6 6 6
but of course they still have no concept of	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
well there there there there another point to that too	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
you know when one of them breaks it it not the outside one	6 6 6 7 2 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
um audiology	6 2	6 6
after- after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the navy she stopped doing it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
how is	3 6	6 6
were were you guys supposed to get a stadium downtown dallas	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you get a wide variety of background so that	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
in the	6 2	6 6
it is	6 6	6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
and it it it it a pretty nice setup	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
but i just really think that the difficulties	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think so too	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
it it nice at night	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6
like in the european countries where they have higher turnouts	6 6 3 1 1 2 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and so i decided well that that it	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
like i say it it just	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
nineteen something fifty	2 4 4	6 6 6
more of the issue versus	7 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 4 4
some people hour and a half a day or anything	2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
could think of right now why we should should have it such as	7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
so um	6 6	6 6
because1 i i need to have it	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but it it the industrial pollution i should imagine	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
except that knowing them they would probably do something	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
so it makes it easier for me	6 3 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know what the answer is	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
starts hitting closer to home	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
just so complex that there there a very large- you know there there is a learning curve	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
quite a bit on sundays	6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 4
they could could	3 6 6	6 6 6
oh i do do get into them that much	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so i made him a deal	6 3 6 3 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 4
so it it getting people clean out their closets and such	6 3 1 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and was the response reasonable given the provocation	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
i mean it it incredible	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
seeing what	6 3	6 6
which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van	3 2 3 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
i never understood this then	3 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6
and not waste so many years to do it	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
it- it is yeah is is it something	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and some of them do do	6 7 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
his home mortgage	2 4 4	6 6 6
they wanted to start like a club	3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
be wary	6 6	6 6
i had gone over to texins	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 2 4
theyre theyre going to do what they want to do	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
she has to stay that much longer	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 4
uh let let see	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh and you know it did did work	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and uh i think things are changing	6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i think they put off so much	3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
well i do do know if they have higher turnouts	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
those are a thousand bucks	2 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
or who you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
an increased amount of of surrogacy	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4
we caught the individuals got caught	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4
the bureaucracy in running it	7 5 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3
where all you guys go	6 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 6
totally different and unheard of	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
it it it it religious based	6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6
they do do laughter-deserve to be let loose	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
i saw a statistic just a few days ago	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
and um well i work all week	6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know they theyd theyd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
well i guess that that fluorocarbons- the fluorocarbons	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
executed anybody since nineteen sixty	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
that that amazing	3 1 6	3 1 6
i do do have that i do do have that	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
lighter sentences	2 4	6 6
change then	6 6	6 6
on a half acre or so of land	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i saw how life was when she stayed home	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
anywhere from six in the morning	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and i- i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
of uh	2 4	6 6
and the skunk would be sitting at her feet	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
one of the	7 5 5	6 6 6
cut us off right there the last few seconds	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and that im im sure that would make a big difference too	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
used to	6 6	6 6
been out of school that long	6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i guess just like other companies other friends ive ive been hearing about that have been moving around	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
uh where they do have a lot more gun control like england and places like that	7 5 3 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
and if- if if you manage to get it out	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous	7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
theyve theyve got an olympic pool and and basketball courts and sand volleyball	3 1 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4

because1 i just watch them over and over again	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4

but i have a problem	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
and theyre theyre still beating on them1	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
all righty	6 6	6 6
oh it it like twenty fifty square feet	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
i- i	6 3	6 6
they would would take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera	3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
i mean here you have the right to vote	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 4
what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
they ask you a few questions	3 6 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
like our miniature schnauzer she she just	6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6
i do do know what our next trip will be	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and then she makes noodles with uh	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
in five years were were supposed to be at max	6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
it is	3 6	3 6
then theyre theyre going to take some other right	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
we certainly get enough coverage	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
for a while	6 2 4	6 6 6
oh that that who the guy is	6 3 1 1 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 2 4
it it	6 6	3 1
that we would	6 3 6	6 6 6
and uh i do do know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 1 6
drug testing procedures would have to be refined	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
um had an impact on the society around here	6 6 7 5 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and we only have one child	6 3 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 4
and theyve theyve quoted statistics that i just about my throat just about fell into my toes	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 4
rebellion and things because of that and the things like the	7 5 5 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
that that when it really gets bad	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 4
he he coming up will you help me with my homework	3 1 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
um to you know fix up your own cars and	2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
might not go if it was voluntary	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
well you can always get up and leave that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
that that the that that the whole point	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6
once i found out that that that really	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
for that	6 3	6 6
if you take your tv tv in a lot of these tv tv repair places will say well ill ill repair your tv tv for a hundred dollars	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
and then you could go on you know to do what else you wanted to do	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
so i do do like to go	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
and i can see what i please	6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
pretty much though	6 6 6	6 6 6
to go back to work	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
i like the older stuff too	3 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 2 4 6 6
um we lived in minneapolis	6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6
sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far	6 3 6 3 6 3 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i know	3 6	6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
weve weve been wanting to	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
trees are supposed to you know purify	2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
that that my understanding of the way um the way it works	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
most expensive	2 4	6 6
the literature they give with you says yeah we do this	7 5 3 7 5 3 6 6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
which mean- would mean	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it was was too much of a job really	3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6
the golden retriever are good dogs too	2 4 4 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i think it was easier when they all had each other and could	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i- i do not much care for them	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
since the united states	6 3 1 1	6 3 1 6
more and more of that	2 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 2 4
there have been teams that have just	6 6 6 2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
i think they definitely have more problems	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 4
and i changed my mind	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
or someone	7 3	6 6
and i	6 3	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
because like at her school	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
i mean yeah	6 6 6	3 6 6
i expected more i think	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4
how that that going to affect	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 2 4
um what do you think	6 7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4

the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
we have the insurance premiums	3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 4 4
at least in the boston paper there were three things that that come to note	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 7	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
what color are they	2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6

but uh they have sort of like uh things that you can- youre youre not	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 3 1 6
we did did really watch it too much yesterday	2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
i do do keep up on it	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 3
the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is	7 5 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
uh the door door open	6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6
local local papers will	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
of course i do do know all that about	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and all these people are registered with their association	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
do my oil changes	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
uh utd utd utd	6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6
so it i mean it	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
oh i i definitely-	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
you know into more violent crimes	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
i im im going to go fishing today	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
or i have a headache	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
it it gonna gonna be quite a while before we can uh	3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6	3 1 3 1 2 6 2 4 4 6 6 3
well i think the biggest thing were were going to see coming up in the next	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
but you know now for instance there are there is the organization women	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
is to protect those who actually did did the crimes	6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 4
it it really pretty here	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
that uh comes	3 7 5	6 6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
and she just	6 3 6	6 6 6
the last time i watched was back in college	2 4 4 3 2 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 2 4 6 4 2 4
and then i was not chosen	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 2 3	6 6 3 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 4 6
and i do do have a problem at all with employers	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic	3 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
and um	6 6	6 6
i went to college and then started working and then	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
uh it has around thirty hundred square feet	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 4
that does does	3 6 6	6 6 6
well you know i think i read about that too	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think all mine have been east coast people so far	3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
even robert redford	6 2 4	6 6 6
and one of the gates has a padlock on it	6 7 2 3 1 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6
if you if they make you an offer then theyll theyll test you	6 6 6 3 6 3 7 5 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 4
well wonder if that	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and you get to meet different people and	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
and that that one reason i have so many because i really	6 3 1 7 5 3 7 2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
you have to laughter-wonder laughter-you laughter-know	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
all their tests	2 4 4	6 6 6
and gosh what what going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
crime and punishment	2 4 4	6 6 6
and theyre theyre in the same classrooms	6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 4
oh that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
what would it take	7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
out here i remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6
and he had he had the bill-	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that exactly how it is you know	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
uh parish or however	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and to come up with something a little better than what weve weve got	6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 1 6
i think uh the judges	3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
just very very athletic	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and you ca ca really clean them	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you ca ca	3 6 6	6 6 6
what do you think about it	7 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 4 6
weve weve got all the different lake editions around the house	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4
the rain forest and all	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
say about the same distance for all of yall yall to come	6 2 4 4 4 4 7 2 3 1 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
or your pocket all the time	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
i took my kids out and taught them how to shoot a gun	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but im im glad it it not too totally cheap because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of going more probably	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
for robbery	6 2	6 6
detroit or whoever it is	2 4 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6
not worried about them running all the neighborhood	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
they come and empty your trash	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
um complimentary to you	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6
woman woman job or a man man job but	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
and then at that point theyll theyll	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6
heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney	2 4 4 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like october	2 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
and so i was thinking gee	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
weve weve all got to do it right now	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
id id like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines	3 1 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
so i was stranded out on the highway	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
of course now fifty percent divorces in the united states	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 4 4
but weve weve had her now for about three years	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
that that for sure	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
they they used to be	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and uh he	6 6 3	6 6 6
but i do do	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
uh this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
this is a little bigger than a teacup	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i i heard something on the news the other night	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh you know just	2 6 2 7	6 6 6 6
if if	6 6	6 6
they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where theyre theyre raised	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
you know because1 to me	6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
from her front yard	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i do do think um	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
appeal process	2 4	6 6
but there again i i do do know if the	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
but i do do think you would uh	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i- i think that that you know i do do have any problem at all with	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6
but they got so much bad publicity too	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
get done with them	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3
and she um	6 6 6	6 6 6
we have- are on pier and beam	3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
of society and that that the school can only do so much on it	2 3 7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 2 4 7 2	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
one of them is a lot bigger than the other one	7 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but i mean what- what what what what happened here is is is	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
they do do they do do even start growing until may	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
you know um they live back in	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
so since the house did burn theyre theyre theyre theyre going	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
and im im not sure what it is	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
interesting thing you want to do	2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
changing people people expectations	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
which is made by toyota	3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4
i mean it took such courage you laughter-would laughter-would believe to go vote the first time because i was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because	6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 4
people outside the air force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do	2 4 3 1 1 2 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
because as far as housework goes	6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
well you can look in the uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and you can play catch across the back yard	6 3 6 6 7 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
and then oh there there we have these we have people wandering around to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
youre youre going to commerce	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4
would be a definite deterrent	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
i mean we educate them	6 6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
i mean theyre theyre not the- the typical country where theyre theyre just you know	3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4
uh what- i mean a babysitter more more or less	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
and it would put a you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 2	6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
that- that-	6 6	6 6
it was like the best of the walt disney ones	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
field of dreams	6 3 6	6 6 6
climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
oh is she still there	6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 4
because1 i want them to come back up next year	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
face the consequences then uh	6 7 5 6 6	6 3 4 4 6
matter of fact ive ive heard that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
and- then it does does matter where you put it and where you hide it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
when theyre theyre ten they have to live in it	6 3 1 7 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you known i	6 6 3	6 6 6

and she moves it around laughter-every laughter-other laughter-day	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 4 6 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you you get used to their style and you really enjoy it	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6

but im im not real sure that we promised them anything	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but in urban california it it just	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6

both yeah both females theyre theyre both spayed	6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
well theyre theyre dangerous	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
or whatever institutions raise the money and uh	6 7 5 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 4 6 2 4 6 3
there is a lot of crime down there	6 6 7 5 2 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6
not six feet	6 2 4	6 6 6
and it it really sad	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
you know because he was	3 2 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6
boris yeltsin the guy that that running the uh or evidently was elected president of the soviet	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 3 1 6
theyll theyll regroup out in the mountains	3 1 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
because1 they did did understand anything else	6 3 6 6 6 3 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
and you know we do check with other teachers	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
we did did put it over because1 we put composition roof on	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i mean they you know	6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i was never one to believe everything my kids said you laughter-know laughter-about something	3 6 6 3 2 4 3 1 1 2 6 2 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
there there hope	6 6 7	3 1 6
and there-	6 6	6 6
i mean they do things that they need that	6 6 3 6 2 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and besides i can be doing other things and still listening to the news	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 2 4
and i really have had a lot of problems with it	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6
then i do do argue with it	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
in in my car	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
actually to tell you the truth i think uh jury selection is a uh prime	6 6 6 3 7 5 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
and theyre theyre going to have to work it out to working part time	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
nothing laughter-basically	3 6	6 6
really severe storms that occasionally come through	2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
what year i mean how old are they	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
or you	6 6	6 6
went through the whole family and stuff	6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
with uh the machinery	6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4
his son son in high school	3 1 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
the either	2 4	6 6
how young can they start t	6 6 6 2 6 7	6 6 6 2 4 6
spending time	6 2	6 6
theyre theyre theyre theyre terrified of them1	6 6 2 4 6 6 3	3 1 3 1 6 6 3
i watch cheers sometimes	3 6 2 6	3 6 6 6
i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 4
and that that a big mistake because1 they do do	6 3 1 7 5 5 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
i mean thered thered be loopholes just like there is in anything laughter-else	6 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 2 3 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know alcohol drug	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
for smashed cans	6 2 4	6 6 6
it it very authentic	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
the atmosphere of being there you know	2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6
at that time anyway	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
now everything else like the trash- um	6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
they ca ca imagine for anything else	6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
permit from the police station in your local area to do that	2 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
fairly laughter-regularly thinking that you know he he he not sure if he he going try to commit suicide or not	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
on a on the side of a hill	2 4 4 3 1 1 1 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
iowa and nebraska	2 4 4	6 6 6
it it almost like they do do want the paper	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i think they deliberately sometimes	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
i just would would want to own one	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
im im used to uh walking out the back yard	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
well is is it funny how baseball baseball getting less than like football players would	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 6
i mean the kurds have tried it before	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
uh and- and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impugned	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
it sounds funny though does does it	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
sometimes i think about	3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
uh sitting in the barber shop	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6
taking care of the home	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
all right	6 6	6 6
and all the girls were all dressed up and	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6
since it it a one story	6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
convicted for	2 4	6 6
likely to do it as if uh if you get something back for it	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
oh is that right	6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6
they make all these people out to be oh	3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i did did know what would have been wrong with	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they they do copy versions they do cover versions of	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 3
the orange crest on top	2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
and so we were going down the highway you know	6 6 2 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 3
and he just	6 3 6	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
basically what it does	6 3 1 6	6 6 2 4
that kind of	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that	3 1	3 1
that new stadium stadium going to be real nice	3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
there was a girl	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4
we went to this dinner party the other night that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
in fact that was advertised not too long ago	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
well the the thing with bush	6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 6
i can see that would be uh	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and everything	2 6	6 6
that uh	6 6	6 6
and one of his fish jumped out of the	6 7 2 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
testing that individual you know on the spot	2 4 4 6 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
it it a lot more fun when youre youre not	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
you know	6 6	6 6
it it just	6 6 6	3 1 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
but the rest of it we just buy things like	6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and that that enough	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
naturally with both	7 5 2	6 6 6
to just you know sit out back	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
and id id pay it	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves	7 5 5 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
wife bless her heart got rid of it	2 6 2 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
had a a good program	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
which means that if you have a good year winning one run- one run games	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
and that they have to do something	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive never heard of it before	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
it sure does	3 6 6	6 6 6
but boy the period of time was fascinating	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4
i wish they would	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
one of the greatest coaches of all time	7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
so so did everybody send in their information	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
that was a while ago	3 6 7 5 6	6 6 3 6 6
the only disadvantage is that they do do pick it up at the curb	7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
but we we should have gotten made sure we got everything	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
so they have big variety	6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
saw parts of those	6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6
im im	6 6	6 1
and you know there there a million dollars you can have	2 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 4 6 6 2 4
you know if someone is	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and it it obvious you know the results of sex are quite laughter-obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
somebody once said	3 6 6	6 6 6
you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
to their own liking and for their own comfort	6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the first year we were living there we had to replace the roof	7 5 5 3 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i have a subaru	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
i guess the guy that that on	3 6 2 4 3 1 2	3 6 6 6 3 1 6
and my child is going to	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh this one guy decided to play uh	6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6
well jeans are are exactly professional	6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
a couple of miles of the highway	7 5 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 3 6 6 2 4
and the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
i am a disgruntled- i am i am just a disgruntled person all around	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4
and that that terrible to look at it that way	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but i was out of the country at the time	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
but the thing that makes me mad is uh	6 2 4 3 2 3 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
ive ive had my car stolen	3 1 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 2 4 4
this is the way i feel about this	3 6 2 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6
i guess it it about	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 6
were were about to hit it here a few minutes	2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
and finally you know who knows	6 6 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
in raleigh	6 3	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 3
we can get news you know	3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i understand that the jails are full of people you know	3 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6
it is it is really outrageous	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
there are some	6 6 2	6 6 6
rather than to have one person be responsible	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i know we had a problem down here with uh oil	3 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
in fact it really was to begin with	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
do do buy them1 that way	6 6 6 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
hey were were paying basketball people	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
and all the other animals	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
that was fun	3 6 6	6 6 6
and he he out of our hair	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
is enough	6 6	6 6
and then on the other side when i when i uh i loaned- loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to a	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
clean up and that sort of thing	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
they they dress	6 3 6	6 6 6
um it it actually it actually funny that um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
because you ca ca enjoy anything any more	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that what i want to do	3 1 1 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at clark	6 3 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
they certainly	3 6	6 6
im im im im probably a little too over laughter-protective	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
serious crimes	2 4	6 6
well we have dogs that are pretty	6 6 6 7 3 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 4
you know	6 2	6 6
some other crimes that i think uh you know	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
they bring their their johns home	3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
all the different stuff like that you know	3 1 1 1 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i thought that was the neatest thing	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i think	6 6	6 6
to see how that that	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
because that that the nuts and bolts of the law and that that what i like	6 3 1 7 5 5 5 2 3 1 6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 2 4
nothing will occur i guess without a crisis	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and we had like	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
well you do do just get ready	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and uh the band i play in uh i	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6
and kind of passed it off so i did did know who had it	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh ive ive always lived down here in the south	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
because um	6 6	6 6
and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
you know officially they do do do they do do have any operations within the united states other than administrative	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 1 7 5 2	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
uh ca ca get as comfortable to sit down	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6
if it is so much anymore	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
and you have to decide that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 4
and i i read a lot for school	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well new cars are are cheap anyway	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
having you know some	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
they have them1 right at the campsites	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4
but it it a drier	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 4
i think it was battle cry of freedom	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i work full time	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
at any point to do you know some	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
sometimes when you lose someone that you	6 6 3 6 3 1 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
that that good	3 1 6	3 1 6
and uh circuit city came along	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
but i do do	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
well kind of have a problem with that	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
on the stop sign	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
and it- it-	6 3 1	6 6 6
and you can go out outside in the daytime all right	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
um so im im kind of glad they have a longer class on tuesday thursday now that i can just kill two nights and	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6
i just turned around and looked at my brief at my briefcase my uh bookcase up here	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 6
i usually try to stay out of kitchen	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
he was was in the book	3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
there there a	6 6 6	3 1 6
but we did uh like two heavy coats over it	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
a little aggravating	6 6 6	6 6 6
but it it it may be the	6 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh quite a bit more taxes	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
one works for the state department	7 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
he went to the gas chamber	3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 2 4 6
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
so do you think	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
did you ever get any information on it like	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
but somewhere in	6 6 6	6 6 6
something that something that ive ive just had a	6 6 3 1 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
tried to memorize	6 6 6	6 6 6
he was a	3 6 7	6 6 3
and so	6 6	6 6
where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
i i do not know how that that	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they just they just announced that did did they	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
it it not a big deal for them to go	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i have have heard of it	3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
i do do	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it ti ti calling	6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 1 6
we just do	3 6 6	6 6 6
they had so much fun	2 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
so it it easy for you to go	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
well you do not have to tend to laughter-him	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
i do do remember	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i i was amazed too	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i think that that one of the things too	3 6 3 1 7 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
youve youve found something else	3 1 6 3 2	3 1 6 6 6
i really can	3 6 6	6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
no communication whatsoever	7 5 5	6 6 6
it it just as	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
that would that would be much	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
how far out from the city i mean do you	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
he he on am am	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
that was was too too bad	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and so	6 6	6 6
i- i think to be	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i did did do it myself	3 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
i see	3 6	6 6
and we are there by going to remove them from society	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it just the system has just	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
are pretty tense	6 6 6	6 6 6
what im im seeing now uh	3 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
they just came down and	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
they even call the newspapers here even call people who already laughter-subscribe	6 6 6 3 1 2 6 6 2 3 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 4
now we talked our	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 3
and just kind of brings that support up in the small-	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6
pretty left wing democrat- democrat	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
but i did did realize that	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
uh and so it it it it required	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
wonder what happened	6 3 6	6 6 6
so we had some interference	6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4
any hope of a job until well unless	7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
a dog you can stop barking you laughter-know laughter-or laughter-whatever	2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
it it is always incredible to me the number of times	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
they do do do that here	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
but they have lot of times theyll theyll have like uh	6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
someone else you know	3 2 6 6	6 6 6 6
i sort of	3 6 6	6 6 6
but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk	6 6 2 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
laughter-you laughter-know	6 6	6 6
to me it	6 3 1	6 6 6
charleston is a really nice place to visit	2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
that that a beautiful state	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 6
is that uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know i i definitely had to disagree with that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4
and you know this this was her father uh you know that that got killed you know just cold-blooded murder him and three other people	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
i got to do more	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4
well weve weve got at least two windows on every wall in the house	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 2 4
in in length	7 5 2	6 6 6
you have to make sure you do do throw away any	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and and what were we trying to do	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
so i mean that that the way we will be going	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6 6 4
i most of my friends have three or four kids	6 7 3 1 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
they they refused to take you off of the list	6 2 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
we live out in the country	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
and he said	6 3 6	6 6 6
so she does does run loose	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
and any kind of long term financial planning or	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
where are you	6 6 3	6 6 6
who who to put the limit on it	7 5 6 6 2 4 6 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
uh my wife and i have a dog that soon be eight years old	6 2 4 3 1 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
that does does do a lot for them1	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
but they theyre theyre already uh have strikes- three strikes against them when theyre theyre out there	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 3 1 6 6
uh an action that youre youre bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury	7 2 4 3 1 1 2 4 3 2 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4
it it been interesting	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
if you park in the lot across the street from the stadium it it four bucks	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 4
now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 6
my home is	3 1 6	6 6 6
i i just think it makes honest people more honest	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
was uh waiting to talk to you that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
to their environment	6 2 4	6 6 6
good luck	7 5	6 6
what would you do to improve it	7 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
or laughter-you can die	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
i was thinking about it just now that- i realized that that actually something that that culturally relative	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 4
was on the jury	6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
i think it is	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre about the smartest tree around	3 1 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 4
i had one call from- actually from charlotte north carolina	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
if youve youve got a charge off on your credit	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
and basically it was a uh repayment for	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
short tiles	2 4	6 6
well it it the whole	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
you know um	6 6 6	6 6 6
our town did did pass the school	3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
to get an even keel on that	6 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 2 4 4 6 6
that that that that been interesting though the kids that	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3	3 1 6 1 6 6 4 6 6 6
scale of one to ten	2 4 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6
exactly what i did	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
that that hard to say	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i do do blame you there	3 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you laughter-usually eat	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
was brought on	6 6 6	6 6 6
and uh so i think were were probably going to see more of that	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and then then they	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
we it it a house we bought uh about	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
i- i guess you work for ti ti	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 4
then it got	6 3 6	6 6 6
were were going to just were were	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
was about ten years	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
but they were better behaved when they were	6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6
and they run for two months at a time	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and i have a niece and nephew	6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 3 6 6 4
oh no	6 6	6 6
my sister	2 4	6 6
collar bone and couple of other things im im sure	2 4 4 7 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
hopefully theyll theyll promote good schools	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
but i doubt that that would come about-	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh put up signs	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
we have to take um	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
to if you if you go on the attack	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but i do do have to worry about you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and i think there are some	6 3 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6
well my wife wife from galveston	6 2 4 4 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it it a	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6
there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 3 7 3	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
extra boards	2 4	6 6
so it it not really	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
so i thought well i will just get on the stick and do it	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
i mean it does does seem right that somebody that makes twenty	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
because i	6 3	6 6
and in fact uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh well good	6 6 6	6 6 6
but ive ive really liked it	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
theyve theyve had a lot of problems because theyve theyve um introduced a lot of dairies there	3 1 6 7 5 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
down the wrong path	2 7 5 5	6 3 6 6
were were qualified-	6 6 6	3 1 6
if new orleans ever gets a quarterback	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
theyve theyve got to kind of change	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
let it	6 3	6 3
i had had heard you know whether they have a new one or not	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
but what somehow or another they attract	6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and even baseball games now where the everything is settled with a fight	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 4
the right to write your	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
you know whoever was	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
well i i mean i feel that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
when i was in high school	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
it took us two or three different people to find	6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
what theyre theyre doing	3 1 1 6	6 3 1 6
so im im kind of glad theyre theyre staying there	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
are okay you know well they can free them	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
other than i guess how you know-	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 4 4 6 3
oh thatd be nice	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
to absentee vote specifically	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
kind of learning how to deal with society	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
and it was was until	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and they start asking questions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it	6 3 6 6 7 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6

that that what im im saying	3 1 1 1 1 6	3 1 6 3 6 6
when i was pregnant with my first little boy	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4
real poor	6 6	6 6
i enjoy it	3 6 3	6 6 6
and that was	6 3 6	6 6 6
were were were in pretty good	6 3 1 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6
this guy guy smart	3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6
so wed wed have to have some way to	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4
the album oriented like the	3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
well that that another problem	6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all summer	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
theyre theyre not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air	3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 1 2 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 2 4
and then the last civil war battle was fought at val verde you know	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
quick examples is the aborigines	2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
course on on stuff that i was	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well anytime that we stop and think it ca ca hurt	6 3 2 3 2 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 4 4
i i i really uh	6 6 3 6 6	6 3 4 6 6
i mean what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 4
and then i just use whatever colors i want to	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 3
uh perhaps well well finally get the	6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
they take my name	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
ive ive made a lot of bibs	3 1 6 7 5 2 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6
affect of the	7 2 4	6 6 6
theyre theyre um	3 1 6	3 1 6
but uh theyre theyre	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh give them an idea of what	6 6 3 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
if i deviate from	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
or either theyll theyll have a computer at home	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
it was not good	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
a monitoring capability	7 5 5	6 6 6
but yeah	6 6	6 6
anyway i uh	6 3 6	6 6 6
so do you	6 6 6	6 6 6
and it	6 6	6 6
but it does does stop	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
what to put on one side of the house and things like that	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
but until youve youve really seen it	6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 6 3 1 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
she was actually a very fun pet	3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
almost ca ca tell the engine is running	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4
you know what	6 6 6	6 6 6
and uh so it it it um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
exactly right	6 6	6 6
and and well i mean	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
im im sorry	3 1 6	3 1 6
but there there definitely needs to be a laughter-balance laughter-somewhere	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
jury to be very sympathetic with the victim	2 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
repairs now to start getting it fixed	2 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 4 4 4
so i- i think most of them1 are	6 6 3 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
workable means to have funds for the school	7 5 5 5 2 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
you just have to be real careful	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
the process of picking jurors is not always objective	7 5 5 5 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
but in	6 6	6 6
and im im like you know laughter-you laughter-do laughter-do laughter-know laughter-what laughter-youre laughter-youre laughter-talking laughter-about	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 3 3 1 6 6
but now we tend to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
he he not that far	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and i mean they looked like a closet to me you know with a desk in it a real small	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
i know it	3 6 3	6 6 6
you really think so	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
is it	6 3	6 6
and that that why jury selection is often very difficult	6 3 1 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
you do do get all the little	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
and committing murder because	6 6 2 6	6 6 4 4
i was going to say you did did have the typical	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and it does does deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 4
you know with	6 2 4	3 6 6
celosias or whatever	2 6 6	6 6 6
something you have have paid in sixty days or ninety days you know	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 6
well i- i feel the other thing too uh	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
they and they have had lawsuits over it	6 6 3 6 6 7 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
ive ive only had one gun	3 1 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
that you ca ca work	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
and they you know	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know the classic	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4
here in monterrey	6 6 3	6 6 6
and um they said that they- they have	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
so there really was was a problem that way	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6
well that that the	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
lower income brackets of the united states	7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 4 6
because1 there is a lot of waste there is is there	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
i was on a business trip at the time	3 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so it it the it it it it the the active- well it it actually	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6
uh some countries voting is obligatory	6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 4
within an hour	6 7 5	6 6 6
but toxic can be	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6
and then i just	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
you know they they make their mess in the cat pan which is	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 4 4
you know i had done something about	6 2 3 2 4 3 2	6 6 3 6 4 4 4
so i try to have things cooked for her	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
but i mean in	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and and i said well you know that was okay	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
um but we um we house sat for a	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh well one is already in college in new england	6 6 7 6 6 6 2 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 4
and so his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
i know their	3 6 2	6 6 6
uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
you know it ran fine	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
and uh went and visited him	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
but but im im not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
i always tried to understand things not	3 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
you know amateurs but	6 6 2 6	6 3 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
but uh the russian economy	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
so those- those are two	6 6 2 6 7	6 6 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
this was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
im im not a member of the nra nra nra although my father is	3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
but the kids in los angeles did did	6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4
and it it a fairly large one to	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6
i- i might	6 3 6	6 6 6
and maybe this is why this has died out	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
im im like you	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
or do you just not do you feel like it it not really going to make that much difference if you do do vote	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 4 6
so that kind of threw them1 off	6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that the uh defense got	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i do do like the new style like of the toyota van and the the new chevy lumina van	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep encouraging- uh you know encouraging them1 and and uh	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
in addition to what one does	2 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 4 4
progressive path	7 5	6 6
i can	3 6	6 6
it is	3 6	6 6
kind of scary you know because you think of	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
just from walking	6 6 6	6 6 6
but you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think youd youd ever know beyond a doubt	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
possibility a few years ago	7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 4
i like chuck laughter-mangione	3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6
carried out very well in my opinion	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it was just i just wish that there was something else	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i love having them1 for that	3 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
i we used to go there all the time	6 2 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and i mean your your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of atlanta	6 7 2 4 4 4 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
heave it up into the back of the van	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 7 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
i think that	3 6 6	6 6 6
well do you have a facility right at the where you work	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
went to a uh to a mud hens double header	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i measured it one time	3 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
i have a	6 6 6	6 6 6
trying to think if there are any	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
why not go to adults too	6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
paroling them without even knowing if theyre theyre you know going to be	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
but a lot women in dallas shop at foley foley	6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
and a dog be running around crazy	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
what in particular would you think that uh women still	7 5 5 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
you bet	3 6	6 6
one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effectiveness whatsoever	6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i thought i ca ca do this	3 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 6
i would say about ten or fifteen years ago	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and i do do think it was my fault because you know i had	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6
youve youve got to find an even line	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
the availability	2 4	6 6
that second type of privacy	2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4
i im im just read two books	3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
everybody does newspapers	3 6 2	6 6 6
although ive ive seen some evidence that you know the	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know they can get a real life experience	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh appeal process	7 5 5	6 6 6
uh there may be cases where	6 6 6 6 2 6	6 3 6 6 4 4
on the other hand though	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
well carol since today today subject is our homes	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
what kind of onions do you grow	3 1 2 4 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
well the- the china situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
well myrna how do you get your news news	6 7 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and i laughter-like	6 6 6	6 6 6
and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
almost every game that i watched	2 4 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
at least what i used to observe in student teaching was that	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
it seems to do a really good job	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
well that that that area over there is not as expensive as in the the immediate you know washington area	6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
except theyve theyve got a	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
there there not much between us and the north pole	6 6 6 7 6 3 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but uh still i i question the ability of some of the teachers	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
they had snacks and story time and everything	3 6 7 2 7 5 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 7 5 5 3 1 7	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
it was a freestanding freestanding machine	3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6
well itll itll be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6
getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year	6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up	3 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 3 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 4 6 2 4 6
and that maybe maybe to think twice about voting	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
that that basically what he was trying to tell us	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i guess not	3 6 6	6 6 6
and you work	6 3 6	6 6 6
and finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
uh on par with them	6 6 7 5 3	6 6 6 6 6
what have you got growing right now	7 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and he was a	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
chief of police for los angeles the guy under gates	7 2 3 7 2 4 7 5 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
if it it a perfect shot go for it	6 3 1 7 5 5 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
but um	6 6	6 6
may or april	2 7 2	6 6 6
because1 theyre theyre talking like it was an american built car	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just ca ca compare	3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
the forty	2 4	6 6
that- it it like a call in survey that says	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 3 7	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4 6 6
i can i was you know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
so you	6 3	6 6
and it seems that theyve theyve gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6
and i looked at that	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
first of all im gonna to tell you i have two little kids	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
so i think on the lines	6 3 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 3 1 6
and set that money aside	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4
they do do see it as supporting the folks the people	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 2 4
they do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
that that would be definitely something youd youd want to keep	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6
well im im im im still learning how	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i do do think i can keep my own garbage	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
everyone- everyone i talk to they say you know	6 3 1 2 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and- and- and im im not	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
it it just me and my sister	6 6 6 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
so that that right off that same kind of principle	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
is pennsylvania kind of out of line there	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
taking that away	6 2 6	6 6 6
the goods flow in and we do do sell	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6
to have	6 6	6 6
as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 2 4 4
and if he fell he was dead	6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
would think of would be tuition	2 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4
i was in high school	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4
so apparently even for the smallest crimes they give the person the	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
but you know in texas	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4
clear- or from the bottom maybe and go clear up	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
so it kind of kills the	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 4 6
like uh national public radio or	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
and so much healthier	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and were were going to brick up the garage to match the house and	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 6
ive ive never been there	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
the people that took	2 4 3 2	3 6 6 6
that that	6 6	3 1
more problem with the temperature except that you know working in engineering	2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know it it uh one of those movies that it it not a great movie	6 6 3 1 6 7 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 6 4 6 6 4 4
much in the past that	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 4
thatd thatd probably be pretty interesting	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
and for capital murder	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 4
like you say it takes a plumber	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
so you know yeah	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
but i agree with you	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 3
well maybe you need to unload it on somebody else-	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
theyre theyre not doing anything for anybody except themselves	3 1 6 6 3 6 3 2 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
on the radio station i think it it k l t y they were talking about the	6 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
now in	6 6	6 6
i do do know what the	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car	3 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4
it it just that if youre youre ever ever really want to just be scared out of your wits	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
do you work	6 3 6	6 6 6
at because nobody it seemed like liked the same thing	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
like crooked you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and then when they hear it it	6 6 6 2 6 3 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6
partying and everything else i decided uh-huh	6 6 3 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
so you know it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6
that that what i need	3 1 1 1 6	3 1 6 6 6
and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
what are they doing	7 6 3 6	6 6 6 4
i mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of california	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
the knowledge or at least the	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i i think that that a	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it	2 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
i said so laughter-do i	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3
sort of bums that they need to get their laughter-life straightened up at an early age	6 6 7 3 1 7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
i- i think there there the the there there so much criminal	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i did did care for that at all	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do think most places are like that anymore	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
were were so protected up here	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 2 4 6 6
but i think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4
uh ostracized by his family uh	6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 4 6
we could never get to go see it together because it it so long	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
i know that does it	3 7 5 5 3	3 6 6 6 6
she knows what she she doing	3 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
i agree	3 6	6 6
they think that im im you know im im on drugs	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6
without any pay	2 4 4	6 6 6
there there a	6 6 6	3 1 6
more money to these people	2 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 2 4
now if there was a sickness or something like that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 2 3	6 6 3 6 2 4 2 4 6 6
tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you laughter-know	7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
i do do you know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
decisions that i just ca ca go along with	2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
he put new wiring in	3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6
she she grown up with them and loves them to death	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
confidently and	7 5	6 6
as luck had it	6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6
maybe if you get along	6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 2 4
that that all	3 1 7	3 1 6
and i also like the fresher air up there	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
there there no way	6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6
to put it very bluntly he could fry	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
im im kind of in favor of it for certain crimes	3 1 6 6 6 7 2 3 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
so it it um it was it was a fun movie	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean i think roseanne arquett was in it too another one that if you blink youd youd miss her	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6
did yall yall do a lot of organized things like uh little league uh soccer	6 2 4 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
small the ballot is i mean if there there one thing if there there one issue	6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
your chances of getting the death penalty after crecommitting uh committing a crime	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
and she was real comfortable	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
it does does cost a lot of money but they have a kids	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 2 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
that that person rushes you	6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 4 6
i should	3 6	6 6
and she was telling me about it	6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 3
at least the young men	6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
so i i i do think that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
were were alerted	3 1 6	3 1 6
cause- i you know	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
unless you really go into a deep background	7 3 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
laughter-it laughter-just	6 6	6 6
i ca ca find one that ive ive done	3 6 6 6 7 3 1 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
all they can offer is an opinion anymore	7 3 2 4 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i saw awakening	3 6 2	3 6 6
uh unfortunately you man got a lot of the	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6
also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun	7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
and if they find who who doing that to those little girls as far as im im concerned he could	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
because theyll theyll arrest someone	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
to um make and everything	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and so uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
because i have a feeling im im never going to get it done	6 3 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 3 7	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6
well it seems to me that	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
i do a little bit where it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i got to stay home with my kids	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4

i worked at mcdonald mcdonald	3 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 4

very few uh	2 4 4	6 6 6
the way you want them to be	2 4 3 2 3 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
but a privilege	7 5 5	6 6 6
it it not	3 1 6	3 1 6
what kind of uh	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
he has nothing	3 6 3	3 6 6
ive ive got a dozen different varieties	3 1 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 6 4
we got we won a log floating ride like five straight times	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4

what does it have it has a death penalty does does it	7 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6
if we can if we can expand the men men roles at the same time like your your taking care of your child	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 2 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
he came from a poor immigrant family	3 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 2 4 4 4
of health of health care and options	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 2 4
i ive ive fully	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
it always costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it youre youre just better off buying another car	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4
presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person	6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i mean here it is	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
things like this	2 4 6	6 6 6
like the guy in california got	6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
so but before i	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
singapore is very supposed to be very safe	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
and she turned out to be wonderful	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
water pump on an oldsmobile	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
i did did know that	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
it started out life as a three bedroom house	3 6 6 7 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
absolutely absolutely	6 6	6 6
but it it	6 3 1	6 6 6
prisons all my life	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
the texas rangers they they lost i think	3 1 1 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
with a dealer	2 4 4	6 6 6
the head of uh the communist party was seen as you know untouchable	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4
any of that kind of stuff	3 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
well my home at the moment is an apartment	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
not when you figure	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
they went microns	3 6 6	3 6 6
um let let see	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
and it	6 6	6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
uh and the parents	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 4
first of all it it never turns out to be life	6 6 7 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
a preschool level then or	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that required a specialist we could find one	3 7 2 4 3 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6
oh wow	6 6	6 6
nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen	2 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 4 6 6 2 4
ive ive been terrible ever since then	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
i think that we are going to be	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i- i do do think im im getting what i should	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
well see then	6 6 6	6 6 6
use those hours to do	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed	7 5 5 5 5 3 7 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
they were	3 6	6 6
um-hum um-hum	6 6	6 6
and i guess it does does have any any automatic features to it	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3
tend to rehearse	6 6 6	6 6 6
all my kids except for one	2 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 4
and then ive ive got it so far	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
but you know that now	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
weve weve been getting those	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6
you just have to eat at home basically	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh is that right	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i mean there was all kind of	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
that that	6 6	3 1
run by females	2 4 4	6 6 6
and i believe in the	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i mean weve weve got coaches that teach	6 6 3 1 6 2 3 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
seems to be a lot of controversy about that	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6
so i do do	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
or i wish i would love to see them go with	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
i i mean im im	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 1
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh	6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 6
i started out as a physical education teacher	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i think i think that that correct	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6
you know your college note or whatever	6 7 2 4 4 7 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know	2 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 6
theyre theyre letting their farm system	3 1 6 3 1 1	3 1 6 2 4 4
was kind of like a game	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
actually i listened to	6 3 6 6	6 6 4 4
are you working right now anywhere	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
so uh we we do a let me think do we	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
when school holidays come around i used to have such a problem with that	6 7 5 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 2 4 6 4
because1 i was uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in maryland they they do have capital punishment	6 2 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i think	3 6	6 6
if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 4 4 6 4
what what that	7 5 3	3 1 6
here i look out my back yard	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
laughter-that laughter-that laughter-okay	3 1 6	3 1 6
i do do think that they could be objective in every case every time	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
he is in like the therapy type thing	3 2 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3
and that that what he	6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6
but when it comes to what kind of sentence youre youre going to lay down	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 2 4 4
and um and actually doing some research	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
basically i just	6 6 6	6 6 6
and especially i think with women increasingly working theyre theyre going to have to demand	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
me too	3 6	6 6
or i think it it a limit now	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 3 6 6 3 4 6
put in in in uh prison	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff	2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6
i think it would be a great idea	3 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
just it	6 6	6 3
there there no point in giving them any more money than we have to	6 6 7 5 5 5 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
just did a thumb print	6 6 3 1 1	6 6 2 4 4
is that true	6 3 6	6 6 6
well um most of the stuff up until now	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
some form some form of	6 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 3
so youre youre on spring break	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
trying to think what ive ive seen lately	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
and i was was ready for kids	6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
laughter-i wish i could tell you	3 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
i said i do do want it	3 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 1 6 6
i do know	3 6 6	6 6 6
and a lot of them1 go over the border especially like mercedes	6 7 5 2 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
theyre theyre delicious	2 4 6	3 1 6
little mercury tracer	2 4 4	6 6 6
we never mess with them	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it could be convoluted- convoluted in many ways where people would	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 4 6
translate the bible into languages of the world that are are yet written	7 2 4 7 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 4
i am going to bet you that	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
went in	6 6	6 6
when you have one child now	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
the effect that it it had on this young man man life is so dramatic	2 4 3 1 1 2 4 3 1 1 1 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
ive ive lost my train of thought	3 1 6 2 4 4 7	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
my wife does uh a small herb garden on the side	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4
over in ti ti mean for ti ti but over in italy	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
in each country from the us us	2 4 4 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 3 6 4
but it is a very nice nursing home	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
and you only get one of them	6 3 6 6 7 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
just came back from there	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well he did did refute it until the last two weeks of the campaign	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4
they say huh well it do do make any difference you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
and if you were trying to follow any type of uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 4
and uh the which which kind of cruel	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
it was i think it was the south east	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
what did you think of reagan as a president	7 6 3 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
and we try to	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
barry levinson did um	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
i have two plots	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
ive ive got about forty kindergartners im im going to be doing working with every day	3 1 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
actually was able to get him over that	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3
at the same time you think	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
we got free tickets because	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
up here we have uh we have quite a few	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4
but even so it i mean it it it it still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
of how they do that	2 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6
there there less of a sense of privacy	6 6 7 2 4 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4
i do do care what kind it is	3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
but give them1 life in jail	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
we do do have concrete slab underneath our house	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
and have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
and this is the way because1 i	6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
if you had to have a drug test	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 2 6 4
he can he can strike- he can swing a couple times if	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
and i guess i i guess	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
deprived could they be if they had a camcorder	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
you get tired of them1	3 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6
they do do take any stands on anything	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they ca they ca ca do anything	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
a few years ago i had an oldsmobile diesel	2 4 4 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
or you probably have something similar	6 3 6 6 3 2	6 6 6 2 4 4
uh to	6 6	6 6
we do do support them	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
i do do hear much about it down here	3 6 6 6 7 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
a preferred curriculum	2 4 4	6 6 6
automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job	2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
family units on sale	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different	3 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
acutely aware of a lot of this	6 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
so this was	6 2 6	6 6 6
it it it it trouble for me to do what i do	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
first of all theyre theyre missing	6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
she probably wo wo be able- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
gamut of	7 5	6 6
you have to save all your vacation time	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
went that way	6 2 4	6 6 6
and oh it was just disgusting	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4
he says looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
they just	3 6	6 6
i went to	3 7 5	6 6 3
i guess find a reputable service	3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6
im im interested	3 1 6	3 1 6
so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or mannish	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4
uh it it a third of an acre	6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
uh you know may execute somebody twice a year	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
uh in in many respects uh	6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
where he plays a a actor that that	6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6
and at that point you know i- i really think	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
do they have many buildings that have security there	6 3 6 2 4 3 2 7 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff	7 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 1	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
sure did	6 6	6 6
and then the titles might sound familiar	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6
not at laughter-all	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh im im pretty much for it	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted	6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
pleasant experience for them	2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6
oh you know a candidate-	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
have enough knowledge on it to even you know	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
come from um like georgia or	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
and i really had had had any any trouble with it until- until that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
i would would i would would dare have a a goldfish here because	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
i did press one	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
the the way the kids behave or	6 7 5 2 4 7 5	6 3 6 2 4 4 6
and i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put on	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 4
you know want to go learn	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
and there there nothing	6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6
we do	3 6	6 6
everybody else that ive ive talked to has been right around here	3 2 3 1 1 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
and if some of them are doing something that they should should be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands	6 6 7 2 3 6 6 3 1 1 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 7 2 3 1 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
you know i mean you hear about people getting mugged	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that that absurd	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 3 4 4
there was a little girl picked up in rowlett from uh	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
but she got over it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3
had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
and laughter-when she heard the topic she said	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
what colord colord you paint	2 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4
and i lived in uh outside of boston for five years	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
uh were were able to uh	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
uh it it a little more difficult to recognize an individual individual performance	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4
well- and and and so many of the so many of the conflicts um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
but that that particular bothers me	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 6
one period hed hed teach pe pe and the next period health and then a period of pe pe	2 4 3 1 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 4
i was drug tested	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
really invading my laughter-privacy	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
charge me to	6 3 6	6 6 6
and um there there hardly	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
and i could	6 6 6	6 6 6
in the workplace workplace	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and that that and that that great if theyre theyre convicted- if theyre theyre sentenced to death	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
you know nice nylons and	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
huh yeah	6 6	6 6
is there anybody who does does	6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6
i guess you run into the pollution factor	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 2 6 2 4 4
how can you expect to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh the action was comfortable	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i mean theyre theyre real hard to find the places that pay	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1	3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4
i think that it can be done	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
we we have deep background checks	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4
so does insurance pay for the body damage	6 6 7 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
bye bye	6 6	6 6
well i heard a a frightening thing	6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to	6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
so but gosh it it really starting to	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and my parents divorced three years ago	6 2 4 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 6 4 4
when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um chinese food	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and i would not have been	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i do know why	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
not just for dealing in drugs	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4
but i think ill ill probably just do it in a roller	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
because like we we said earlier that you know the	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
uh but there is this one campsite	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 4 4
but i would would	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
um kind of takes away	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
so it it kind of like they were	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
not in pe pe	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
are you um are you someone who works outside your home	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
obviously you do	6 3 6	6 6 3
it has nothing to do with us	3 6 3 2 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 4 6
as the	2 4	6 6
because1 when youre youre touristing you probably do do want to take the time to	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 2 4 6
for two children if im im not mistaken	2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and he he five	6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6
and they said well we just plan on	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they get really upset	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and how how tight you have the lid down on it	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
some of those countries were so safe it was unreal	2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 4
well i ive ive seen more	6 6 3 1 6 7	6 6 3 1 6 6
see i even know his name because he he on the news a lot	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
and we had a female mayor here in dallas	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
and i read in this article i could could believe it	6 3 6 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 3 6 1 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and then you know the special reports	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and group them into age	6 6 3 6 7	6 6 2 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and this guy in front of me said i ca ca believe i was summoned	6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 4
i would like to be a little more	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
theyve theyve um theyve theyve had police officers come in	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4
ive ive heard of that ive ive heard of it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
my sense of humor	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
well of course youve youve been at clark enough that you know it it always cold	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 3 1 6 6
weasonable-reasonable reasonable and proper	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
you know they were were a state	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
um but i i just do do quite	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i really like it	3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6
when i was in college	6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
johnson city	3 1	6 6
that that that true	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
it it going to take uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 6
that in the last ten years	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4
i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
and can protect against the tyranny of democracy	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
or or you know grant you with their presence you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
which brings us back to the idea you know someone someone got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in	3 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
well what the what the argument is	6 6 6 3 2 4 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 4
you have to do that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4
see i was picked for another murder trial before	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
uh you know it it not good for civil rights i guess	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
and i get paid monthly	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
uh here here what went on in asia	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but it was a drug	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
and this is something that i see	6 3 6 3 1 1 7	6 6 2 4 6 6 6
a a teaching aid	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
just uh just getting the one guy from the lab	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
so how long are we suppose to talk for	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
because1 if if theyre theyre dead for too long	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
repair work to do on them1	2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
and put up for a jury	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
getting it going	6 3 6	6 6 6
well uh	6 6	6 6
especially when when going to spend the next eighteen years in laughter-school	6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
what do you think about capital punishment	7 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and then thelma and louise	6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 4
another thing	2 4	6 6
now we had one	6 7 6 7	6 6 6 6
im im sure in dallas since youre youre	3 1 6 6 3 6 3 1	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 1
normally- and theyre theyre doing something that normally i really only invite people to	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 6
elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you wo wo even notice it though	3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
every- every once in a while i will keep in in touch with maybe like who who in the top five of hitting or	6 6 6 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
there there a conflict	6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6
plus by the time you get a babysitter and then pay to go to the movies it just	6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but it is pretty scary	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
you know the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management	6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
his last appeal was	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
oh what what that	6 7 5 3	6 3 1 6
that theyre theyre so good at it	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
well you know these	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
a lot of my friends have a taken	7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
we used to	2 6 6	6 6 6
unless youre youre sort of clearly of an	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 3
oriole game	3 1	6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
i was going on my way home from thanksgiving	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and but once i get started i ca ca put it down	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know anything about it	3 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
conviction and	2 7	6 6
exactly why	6 6	6 6
and i am just in awe to see this	6 3 6 6 6 7 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
but yes	6 6	6 6
there are lots of things that could be done in that line including things like videotaping videotaping	6 6 7 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 2 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
sometimes when your your in the suit and feel	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
that that probably true	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
that that really scary	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in front seat	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
there is such a demand here the market you know	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4
even when they was very very popular in the early sixties	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
some of it	7 2 3	6 6 6
and and most people	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
hell hell end up killing laughter-himself	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 4
uh her	6 3	3 1
i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone	3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 7 3	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
i mean it- it- it it indicative across the board that we weve weve done something wrong	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 1 6 3 7	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
had to build the one the low side up	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
uh weve weve actually had some warnings in uh raleigh	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
was it save america	7 3 7 2	6 3 6 4
what weekly um magazine do you look at	2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and they backed up into it with a truck	6 2 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
let let see	6 6 6	3 1 6
and i i was afraid that rambo was going to do the same thing that rocky was going to do you know go into fourteen hundred episodes	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
but i do do think there there any way you could go uh the peace corps could go in and rescue those people	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
what what for instance what are you	6 6 6 6 7 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and and base	6 6 6	6 6 6
but you-	6 3	6 6
according to what you you hear	6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
there there been and extraordinary amount of	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 6
and we	6 6	6 6
in california	2 4	6 6
so the backyard is just	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
it came out right around the time with sophia loren	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
then you come in the first	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4
you can	3 6	6 6
that i really liked	3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6

the credit bureau and say hey you know	3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6

at all	6 6	6 6
and people would leave me alone	6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and i know that theyve theyve there there been discussion about men also getting maternity leave	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4

his degree was in uh	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
mine do do either	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
um so	6 6	6 6

theyre theyre like you say theyre theyre not the most exciting pet	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
i think a	3 6 6	6 6 6
uh from his son son school	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
i really like doing stuff like that	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
women libber	2 4	6 6
you know there there the classic sort of to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get you know jury which	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 3 7 6 7 2 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4

under certain circumstances	6 7 5	6 6 6
uh i im im just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
were were in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that	2 4 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i i ca ca identify them laughter-either	6 3 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know aspects to it that are are really desirable	6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
that my sense is that i have	6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i just went out and got a new vcr vcr vcr yesterday	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 4 4
theyre theyre theyre theyre uh	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
and this comes from	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and you know here we are	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
you see it for uh you know a couple of hours or an hour	3 6 2 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4
i remember i saw him in a	3 6 3 6 3 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
an article in the paper just this week where i think it it uh	7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 7 3 7 6 6 7	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 6
it it already	6 6 6	3 1 6
apartment type break-ins break-ins	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
uh theyre- theyre theyre going to the big cities	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
forgot about that	6 6 3	6 6 6
well wonderful	6 6	6 6
of the employee- employee is is hurting the business	2 4 4 4 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4
done by repeat offenders	6 6 2 4	6 3 4 6
that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in texas	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
credit cards	2 4	6 6
none of the yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar	7 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
you know you you sit here	6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 3
i know	6 6	6 6
but you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in dallas last year	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
and so god just really blesses him in ways like that	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and smoke is smoking is it	6 6 6 2 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 6
i should know	3 6 6	6 6 6
i think i just heard something the other day	3 6 3 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
um but now nowadays they ca ca even	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
tax schemes um in into place in the next few years	2 4 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and it it been a real good car	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
or certain privileges	6 7 5	6 6 6
but i taught junior high	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
that that says	6 6 6	6 6 6
the uh	6 6	6 6
the benefit i guess of crime outweighs what the deterrent is	7 5 3 7 5 2 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
all right	6 6	6 6
well if i do do take it then they wo wo make me wear it	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
me too	3 6	6 6
five bedrooms	2 4	6 6
im im not sure what it is there	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
it it preceded by uh several other books by these guys	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5	3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 4
because it just was not uh something	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
now of course	6 6 6	6 3 6
or somebody that that maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership uh	6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
well at vines the coaches do do do that	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6
for only a certain amount	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
at at best	3 1 6	3 1 6
and theyre theyre synthesizing it for us	6 3 1 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and they call you up	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
and so i left the dog locked in the bedroom	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 4
heinous crimes	2 4	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
do you know	6 3 6	6 6 6
well that that fact	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
i- i sometimes think that it it almost frantic effort	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
all that	3 1	6 6
you know that that what they did	6 6 3 1 1 2 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
because you do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
and theyre theyre so much more beautiful	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
or uh when we have	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
know were were going to spend	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
actually uh that is really a sore spot with me	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
sam sam is part of wal-mart	3 1 6 2 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 4
and it stopped raining almost twenty hours ago	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
good law uh crimes murders related with uh drugs	2 4 6 2 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
it it uh it it helped us so that we have have been	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
magnified to attract people people attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that	6 6 6 3 1 2 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6
i mean it really does	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and um and theyre theyre all eight and under	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4
that is just too scary	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i have absolutely no compunction about uh	3 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
or at least speeds them1 up	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
i uh	6 6	6 6
but it it almost eight hundred kilometers you know	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
that is something that is not required	3 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
uh no	6 6	6 6
but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
my wife and i are	2 4 7 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
i just did did have time to go to the movies you know	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3
now i	6 6	6 6
and so i bought a ninety	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 4
until it it all over	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
oh here here an easy way to make some money	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh if it it a corporation that was uh you know harming- harming some individual	6 6 6 6 7 5 3 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
ive ive heard that	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i do do understand the	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i mean uh my brother works for ti ti	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
well now any uh just believe in just about any state in the union uh uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6
a pleasure meeting you	7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6
he he uh he wants to go into engineering	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
that that one of the um	3 1 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6
there was a peter frampton song	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4
i think that people are getting off too easy	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing	6 3 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
but he plays wonderfully	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
i did did know that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
that that	6 6	6 6
and now theyre theyre like	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
there was not there there not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 2 4
have a good day	6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6
now we do do have the ability to	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
and i- i do do really care what it takes to qualify whether youre youre uh an an	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 3 4 4 6 3
but ive ive kind of in ninety ive ive kind of gone down hill	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
you know to get money	6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6
that works	3 6	6 6
pretty tough law and order state	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
but um	6 6	6 6
back in those times we	6 6 2 4 3	6 3 6 4 6
especially given today the drug abuse that goes on	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and that did did really have a purpose	2 3 2 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know that anybody would feel good	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
the cats do it in there	2 4 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
the uh trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eighty	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6
and and	6 6	6 6
and i think uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i kind of uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
or do they need a six person jury or	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i was there during the during the trial actually	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and so were were able to	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
but they do do	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
a lot of uh	7 5 2 4	3 6 6 6
you were you were tested for drugs as you got into uh as	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
you probably do do want to take them to see silence of the lambs	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
push one again	6 2 6	6 6 6
all they see is just the gangs	7 3 7 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
but ive decided that	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to	6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
you know the- the reaction	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4
and i i i i have to think that	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 6 6 6 4 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and where weve weve been very fortunate	6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
that that okay	3 1 6	3 1 6
but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and the	6 2	6 6
when you	6 6	6 6
ive ive always	3 1 6	3 1 6
i was in education and	3 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 4 6
of the three of those diner diner probably the best	6 7 5 2 3 1 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
oh my word	6 6 6	6 6 6
i have have had a big problem with that though	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
all i agree with that	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and then you end up with a decimal	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays	3 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
im im	3 1	3 1
there there no way	6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6
we we did did damage enough of their arsenal	6 3 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
with the nice lids those get thrown away	2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
i think that that part of the role reversal is it it okay to get married	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 3 1 6 6 6 4
medical benefits and those kinds of things are	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it a little tercel	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 3 1 6
use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
in you know	6 6 6	6 6 3
and it it in a case	6 3 1 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6
it it it it really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them1	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 6 6 3	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
well dana it it been really interesting	6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4

it it like oh boy i wish they would stop doing that	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
or contract when the weather changes	6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
doing our own work i prefer it to a professional	6 2 4 4 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know it it going to take the uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6

to the people do these phonathons	6 3 1 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
it it pretty set far back off the road	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
for some reason	6 7 5	6 6 6
uh between	6 6	6 6
situations where the woman goes back to work because that that what she wants to do	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4
they offer	3 2	6 6
laughter-after that if	6 3 6	6 6 3
and less	7 5	6 6
i do	3 6	6 6
you go where	3 6 6	6 6 6
where i was a collector	2 3 2 7 5	6 3 6 2 4
so uh what was the last car repair you had	6 6 7 6 7 5 5 5 3 7	3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
a new carrier was coming in and uh	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
youve youve got some kids thatll thatll pick up on it in the first three minutes youre youre talking about it	3 1 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 2 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 3	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 3
oh oh i know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i think that were were probably going to see a lot more companies um	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i i was curious if you had seen it	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
our- our-	6 6	6 6
and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 3 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
and maybe he will	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
look at the statistics	6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4
that that the way i looked at it	3 1 2 4 3 2 4 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
it was very interesting	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
and it it kind of a weird feeling knowing youre youre sitting there saying- like people have died here	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
and then you start making a movie	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i did did want to be a lawyer anyway	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but my mama was not raised like that	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
circuit city	3 1	6 6
well the times that were really fun were when uh we had	6 2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
is going to be miles per hour	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
it it nice	6 6 6	3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and what is he going to do prison to the other laughter-people-	6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
particles in the air	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
during the summertime	6 2 4	6 6 6
we used to try to get together	2 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6
a convention type thing	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
and i i really enjoy it	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 3
you know	6 6	6 6
it was like it it going to take them1 quite a while to rebuild	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
you know from what i pick up on the news	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so many times i mean you had the uh	7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
well you know they	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
to um	6 6	6 6
i think that	3 6 6	6 6 6
and that that the only way it it going to happen	6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
based you know in terms of you know in in pensacola	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
totally am for	7 5 5	6 6 6
i mean it was- it was in the	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6
uh stronger that the jury system should be changed	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
and i do do think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 3 7 6 6 6	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and were enforced	6 6 6	6 6 6
we froze a lot of peppers	3 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
but everybody	6 3	6 6
i guess the question also is that we discovered is that they do do throw rascals out	3 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 6	3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 4 6 4 6
if if you do do have the punishment	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 4 6 6 4
and im im like baloney	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
uh i think theyd theyd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person person guilty	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 3 2 4 4
or i should should say high	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
the last ten years i guess	7 5 5 5 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
thought was showing prejudice to	6 6 6 7 6	6 3 4 4 4
if the person- has had their social security- her social security number	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
and i do do feel like i have-	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
it does does involve children	3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
or something like that before	2 3 2 3 6	3 6 6 6 4
just out of it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
more of an old fashioned type	2 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 4
hispanics here instead of blacks	2 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4
i do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
the case was for sure	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
which to me is is disturbing	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
but she do do like it	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
i hope were were called up before too long	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
so im im	6 6 6	6 6 6
health health related	2 4 4	6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
they did that three or four years before they	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
all right	6 6	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
youre youre welcome	3 1 6	3 1 6
i ca ca imagine	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and so if i was i was so anxious to have them and i could could wait to have them it would be kind of silly	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
is because they know that they can get away with it	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it certainly makes it easier to dress	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
dollar we have is is spent accordingly	2 3 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
or they do do serve very much of the time	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
that that where practically everybody i talked to is from	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 2 4 6 6 4 3 1 6
but i said to her	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3
you get a	3 6 6	6 6 3
knowing that to be true	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i think that that the key	3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6
but if the tail is straight on it	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6
you bring in your old wire hangers	3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
again it gets into these much fun	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 6 6
that it	3 1	6 6
and ive ive enjoyed our talk	6 3 1 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6
but i do do think of that every day even	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
the only field im im not familiar with really is education which is required as	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 2 3 2 4 4	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
uh that that why i stayed in stayed more towards- towards uh	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
thatd thatd be kind of fun i think	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
and there there no bugs	6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6
people you know	2 6 6	6 6 6
uh try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
it may not be	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
too far	6 6	6 6
i see	6 6	6 6
i know what you are saying	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
most of the service people fairly regularly	7 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 4
they do do vote for someone because	3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 4
well if you do get money back from	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
they call them1 flags	3 6 3 1	6 6 6 4
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
what branch were you in	2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and most- the problems with kids in school carrying guns and	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
oh so	6 6	6 6
and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those laughter-boxes	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
you know the whole	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties	6 7 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
you know and you look at our society	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
i think i saw that one	3 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 2 4 4 6
i do remember	3 6 6	6 6 6
well well have enough bedroom space	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
oh definitely	6 6	6 6
you hope	3 6	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
but i mean uh baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
we were	6 6	6 6
repeat- uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
i mean because it was	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
did you put them1 up in other peoples peoples houses	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
in day cares and in	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
but uh it it basically just ground up swiss cheese and then uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
or is it	6 6 3	6 6 6
if youve youve ever been to like new york city	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and that that why	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
well do you all have um	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
theyre natural water uh	2 4 4 6	6 6 4 6
weve weve got a lot of that influence	3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6
made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small v eights in and went	6 7 5 5 2 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 6 6
but they really were all there	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
um it it in ventura	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
watch that and	6 2 6	6 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
that they try to be careful	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
you gonna gonna get ten or fifteen bucks for it	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3
i mean	6 6	3 6
do do you think there there going to be still a family unit	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
they were talking about uh oh i know what it was	2 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
businesses are taxed eight percent	2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
ninety i would say about	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
i see	3 6	6 6
has the metric equivalent written on there	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 6
yeah you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
i like hebert um	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
well i think uh the drug- the laws on uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
you enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use	6 6 2 6 7 5 5 3 7	6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
they will	3 6	6 6
let let see there there a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
oh oh i know who you mean	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
and everything is wrong with it	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
what kind	2 4	6 6
pretty quick from what he said	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
well uh we just bought our house uh last july	6 6 7 6 6 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
what was the results there	7 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 4
my instructor pilot was a	2 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
did you just move down here	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre flashing lots of money around	2 4 4 7 5 5 2	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
well well see more females	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
uh so i i think there it it probably	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
well im im kind of leaning towards	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
that kind of thing	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6
and he was caught	6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4
you know you must	6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6
it it uh marketed of course it its own dealerships	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
they have this huge fight going over redistricting here	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6
i think there there a check for felonies-	3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4	3 6 3 1 2 6 6 6
i do turn that on	3 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6
people pay- pay uh a great deal	2 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
would have a hard time especially if i was on a jury not wanting him to you know	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep	6 6 6 6 2 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until theyre theyre	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
are quite large in some cases	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
dollars spent for this that or the other	2 4 4 3 1 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it does does matter what you do	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession- profession in des moines iowa	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 3 6 1 6
for a long time was out of the country	6 7 5 5 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4

but uh	6 6	6 6
but what about the community	6 7 6 3 1	6 6 6 2 4

there there an association here in town of professional home care providers or something like that	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 6 6
this is	3 6	6 6
i mean the	6 6 2	3 6 3
maybe that that why	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
you want you want a nincompoop jury because theyll theyll sympathize with you a bit	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4

nut and bolts system called wentworth	2 4 4 4 4 7	6 3 6 4 4 4

and they can actually rig it	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 3
and that that all the game is	6 3 1 7 2 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well that that what i did when i was growing up	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 2 4

you mean fifty dollars	3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6
for driving like in the ice and snow	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
you know uh with with a	6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 3
that theyre theyre dumping	3 1 1 2	6 3 1 6
and youve youve got to come up with a decision	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that that good	3 1 6	3 1 6
actually theyve theyve been doing the same thing here	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
we used to always go to their games	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4

being so quick to sue you	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
were were just not willing to get up that high	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4

im im just getting	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
that that the way things have gotten	3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
it it usually pretty safe during	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
that was a few years ago	3 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
and then many schools on a particular day during	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4

you know the house payment	6 6 2 4 4	3 6 2 4 4
and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
there was a interview done on the assistant	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4

uh the other one is uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6
i guess i was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4

i think that may solve a lot of that	3 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1
i think there was four or five different people	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
if you if you if youre youre not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 4

being rearrested and	2 4 4	6 6 6
i think something something wrong with this	3 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
i think that that really important	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
i think they feel they can criticize if they laughter-do laughter-do	3 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
and he says he he so interesting mom	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4

that that very true	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and we have a soccer team that comes and goes	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and if you have to have it in a hurry something something wrong	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6

with some with something like that	6 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 4 4
but you you got the use out of it	6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6
which is the inducement to recycle- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and last year there were six	6 2 4 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 4
well uh	6 6	6 6
oh no	6 6	6 6
it it it it it a mess	6 6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 4
lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist	6 6 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
you know i	6 6 6	6 6 6
well it is	6 6 6	6 6 6
and if youre youre older	6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6
you are	6 6	6 6
and more knowledge than a jury would have	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
i think that that right	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
that will be neat	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
and uh it it strangely enough it it almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
since galen goes to nursery school we pay our	6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
that dialect	2 4	6 6
and uh they	6 6 6	6 6 6
if i voted for bush	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 4
and the cat cat just looking at me like sorry	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
both in society and in the work place	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
come to a stop light they had a rash of where people were	6 6 7 5 5 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
i think it it like six bucks now in the theaters	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin and what have you	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 3
and that that what all these	6 3 1 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
and uh the band i play in we	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
so i just	6 3 6	6 6 6
and you know i mean a lot of people they go	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
so it it kind of a	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
which is the sort of	3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
it looks like theyve theyve got a weapon	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
i i agree	6 3 6	6 6 6
well do you think that should be implemented in the work place	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
we were we tried to move over to raleigh last year	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
uh came up that i did did think were fair or handled correctly	7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
they were young men	3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
that would be nice	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
im im going to be able to make my own clothes	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i do quite a bit of business in washington	6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4 6 3	6 3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
you can unfold them	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
but they both have a lot of credit cards	6 3 1 6 7 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
my price right now for what i pay	2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it is some type of iris though	3 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
but the topic was boring i thought	6 3 1 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 4
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
uh that everybody	7 3 1	6 6 6
which i think is good because there there a lot of people that are very	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 6 2 4
that that one i can watch over and over and over again	3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
that that a that that a	6 6 6 3 1 2	3 1 6 6 6 6
in their lifetime may win	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
um or she would would buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh it was great because uh	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
when you have your slow readers	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it	3 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
uh it it difficult for me to	6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
that really burns me because	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
like fifteen by	6 7 2	6 6 6
but any rate that that off the subject	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
we we tried to be	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
very very few women in technical writing	2 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6

what i did	3 1 6	6 6 6

i think the only people who	3 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 6
i mean there there a point of over kill	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
they they may have gone down a little bit	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6

there should be a limit as to the number of appeals	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
evening for doing errands	2 6 6 3	6 3 6 6

it it not crowded	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
put in a perennial	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
there there very few i would want to see that many times	6 6 7 5 3 2 4 4 4 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
so it it not a new home	6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
maybe there ought to be some kind of	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
if id id of had that many id id of had to work	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and this past semester ive ive taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on	6 2 4 4 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 6 4 4
sort of rent	6 6 7	6 6 6
there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
it it been eighty degrees on christmas day here before	6 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
become kind of depressed because there there been so many layoffs with big companies including texas instruments	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
i mean i could i could upgrade	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 2 4 6 4 4
uh just	6 6	6 6
laughter-not because there there much laughter-else	6 6 6 6 7 2	6 6 3 1 6 6
and youre youre talking to the other half that that paying for it	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
uh my	6 3	6 6
is six days away from getting out of	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the smog there	2 4 4	3 6 6
they they think they	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean it does does happen very often because it it just an accident	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
the first really popular you know wide spread one was uh proposition thirteen which was a uh tax revolt	2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 3 7 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
robberies or things like that you know	2 7 2 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you can	3 6	6 6
the the difficulty would be in whether it it voluntary or involuntary	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
and they lose their constitutional rights	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
i was going to say more	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
and you get it back	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 2 4
and i went ahead and pursued that	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but they could could put everybody up	6 2 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh that that great	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
i use to think that you know after you worth	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
i i have never been able to understand that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6
i started looking	3 6 6	6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
it got rusty after about um three weeks of use	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
and my son uh went to camp	6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
however im im sure theyre theyre there	6 3 1 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 3 1 6
he ran out to the store for a few minutes	3 6 6 6 7 5 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
but i i i would would trade the experience for anything in the world	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
and my husband heard me laughing	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4
set aside money for bonds	6 6 2 4 7	6 6 6 6 4
it really is	3 6 6	3 6 6
and then um i ca ca remember that guy guy name the one that held out for the money	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
i would would let them go to a public school system there	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
spending the rest of our lives just laughter-getting laughter-this property developed	6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
more like a side show than anything else	6 6 7 5 5 5 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
so you said youre youre from mississippi	6 3 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
no i guess maybe- probably a hundred percent of them1 all	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 3 7	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
we live right outside the city	2 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
there was a	6 6 6	6 6 6
now what are your opinions on recycling	6 7 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
and then um make the sauce when youre youre ready to um to serve it	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 4 4
if if if they keep giving everybody	6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and im im not sure	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
the quarterback	3 1	3 6
then you youre youre either challenged which is you know	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i mean it was	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 3
actually a school related thing or not	6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 2 4 4 6 6 4
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
to get out or to have the the more runs	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
uh it there there uh a death penalty associated with it	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
and it really scared me really bad because i thought	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
then- then they can have them play against each other	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
but i know what youre youre	6 3 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 3 6 6
then you go to work	6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4
you know what	3 6 7	6 6 6
uh institutions are slower to	6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
definitely not one of the	6 6 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
that are endangered or obsolete	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i guess you could consider that organized	3 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
so i	6 6	6 6
or the new jersey	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
kind of suburban	6 6 6	6 3 6
to get spanked	2 4 4	3 6 6
if it was up to the judge alone that	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
im im kind of uh grateful for the experience because it it taught me a lot of restraint	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 3 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
a number of cases here	2 4 4 4 6	3 6 2 4 4
you want to go ahead and start	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and you know if youre youre going to be jogging on the side of the road that that that that even more miserable	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and that that kind of scary to think that	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
a house or something	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4
that that um	3 1 6	3 1 6
and you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand	3 6 6 7 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
so that that kind of hard to have a budget	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well i would say the saints after	6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
with that new uh michael j fox movie the hard way	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6
we may be seeing them this weekend	3 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
if we had a quarterback this year	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and once you do that you lose everything	6 6 3 6 2 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
we had cat you know my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 6 2 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
is it snowing up there	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i was tested uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6
jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 3 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and so this book it just really ties all these things and how to train the child	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
there there really not that much of a problem with	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
is going to be allowed to get away with it either	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
you know how you going to	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and from a news magazine	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
oh well	6 6	6 6
a trash can and you for people to put their aluminum cans in	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
i guess in my own	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
i found about	3 6 6	6 6 6
it it a lot of trouble to to take care of that	6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 6 3	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out	3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
and she she lived there for like	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
for the	6 3	6 6
theyre theyre like	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean uh the last two uh years	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
to me	6 3	6 6
i sometimes feel like um the dallas paper and the dallas news	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
there are certain circumstances	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
it was	6 6	6 6
well do you think weve covered baseball	6 6 3 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and an eight year old stepdaughter	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
oh that that neat	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
and then from the parents parents side have the parents support the school get involved	6 6 6 3 1 1 2 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
the next subdivision over from me	2 4 4 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 4 6
and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4
and i bought a pistol there	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 2 4 4
is is the	6 6 6	6 6 6
you have one for paper	3 6 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
it it actually cobb county	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans	6 3 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
it becomes the organization instead of	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6
i may	3 6	6 6
exercise is so important to good health	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 4
you know doing the sentencing	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
the company	3 1	6 6
oh certainly not	6 6 6	6 6 6
james michener	3 1	6 6
somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody	2 6 2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
youve got to you crack the steering column	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
from any sort of an inquisition after	6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
maybe it should be	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you do do like to see how you work	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i figure them out	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
in baltimore we have similar	6 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
if it it random then it it random	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6
and it was just uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 6
limited to	6 6	6 6
ours do do ours does does start until uh next week	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4
i think the schools are having more and more problems	3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 6 4
have you seen it	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
it it about forty miles west	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
what the problem	3 7 5	6 6 6
and then we got into different um themes you know	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4
location- one centralized location	6 7 5 5	6 6 4 6
it it just a	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i was on a jury trial last year	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
he did it by himself	3 6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
as a	7 5	6 3
well it is	6 3 6	6 6 6
so basically that that that that	6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt	7 5 5 5 3 1 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
um especially there was a little store close by	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
well i do do know if ive ive done it quite that much	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
says here buy me and go rob a 7-eleven	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4
soda manufacturers and uh	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
than you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
and like how many kids you had and who you had married	7 5 2 4 4 3 7 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
i come home from work	3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
i was trying to remember what it was	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well i got to be going	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and we shouldve shouldve	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i really do	3 6 6	3 6 6
do you smoke	6 3 6	3 6 6
im im pretty much the same	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
i mean you can just sit	6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 6
i i have a friend	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
large labs	7 5	6 6
rather than having someone	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and uh overdo overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which do do belong in the uh at least in my opinion	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
and the american people	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
i had two cars there for a while	3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well it it like when my son goes up into the	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre you know come from a broken home and their parents are	3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 6	3 1 3 6 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6
and so that that what i got my certification in	6 6 3 1 1 1 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 3 7 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
i uh	6 6	6 6
then that that kind of a family visit and a vacation	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
i need to go over there and stay about twenty years so i can just travel	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage	3 2 3 2 3 2 4 6 6 2 3 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4
the campsite that we went to was an area that	2 4 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
i do do know i think like mid eighteen hundreds	3 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
and weve weve got a den	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
matter of fact i did did make it completely through that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and then from eighteen sixty	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6
gotten worse in my opinion in the past few years	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
so they	6 6	6 6
you know republics as a separate country	6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
give us a hard time were were going to say	6 3 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i myself	3 1	6 6
it was	6 6	6 6
the reasons that theyre theyre doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it it like two different things	7 5 2 3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4
all the time	2 4 4	6 3 6
it it divided	6 6 6	3 1 6
and then we did did have prohibition	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 3 6 6 6 6
to the fire for discrimination	7 5 5 6 7	6 3 4 4 4
and i also think	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and he just	6 3 6	6 6 6
you would think you know that they were all dogs the way she would	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 7 5 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
and that that not too far away	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
understanding- laughter-understanding those folks	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i think it was a three fifty	3 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 3 6 6 6
what take what type of business takes you to those climates	6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
gang things that are happening	2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
good much better than a lot because im im chapter one	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6
there are many of them	6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6
i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 2 4 6 3 4 6 4 4
other uh planning efforts went into that	2 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 4 6 6 6 6
one is	7 6	6 6
and they theyve theyve got um theyve theyve looked at i think twenty teams	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
i usually lease them1 since i own a business	3 6 6 2 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
the general schwartzkopf	2 4 4	6 6 6
and see now were were dealing with having to bring it back again	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know if i im im in favor	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
and we we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars	6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
i used to really like the looks of the mpv mpv mpv because1 it looks more like a minivan minivan rather than	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 1 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 3 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 3 4 4 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
i mean some i	6 6 7 3	3 6 6 6
it it for drug use	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
or send them1 to private schools	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean weve weve laughter-just	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
is a good thing	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
takes awhile to to get used to something	6 7 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
um that that on at let let see	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 1 6
laughter-you laughter-probably laughter-could	6 6 6	6 6 6
in the long term	6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6
it it one of those	3 1 7 2 4	3 1 6 6 4
we do do seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
however there are solutions to it	6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
or goods- you know more money going out	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
i think there needs to be more places	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
it it a luxury item	6 6 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 4
but i just do do	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
so one of the things that he took over was the cooking	6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4
but they do do	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
in these areas	6 2 4	6 6 6
uh but-	6 6	6 6
uh district attorney before	6 7 5 6	6 6 4 6
and then they	6 6 3	6 6 6
you know a lot of	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer	2 4 3 2 4 4 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
smoke buckets i call laughter-them1	7 5 3 7 3	6 6 6 4 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
or is she going to go back to work	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
disappointed because i was	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
they target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals	3 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
but i think that	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
there was a thing on	6 6 2 4 7	6 6 2 4 6
it it not a good idea	3 1 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 1 6
back when i was going to school	6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
a judge can be	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
there there a little thing at the bottom	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
a man was looking at my car	2 4 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 3 1 6
and those are so neat	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and the very first bill i paid it	6 3 1 1 1 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
and of course then they had to go back	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think were were gonna to do uh another bathroom	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
if shell shell	6 3 1	6 6 6
seemingly- seemingly up to that limit	6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 4
vpi vpi vpi	7 5 5	3 6 6
washed out	6 6	6 6
when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
an and their parts are	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6
i mean it it really hard to say	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
what was it	7 6 3	6 6 3
touch my daddy daddy guns or something like that	6 3 1 1 1 1 1 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it was on the news every night	3 6 6 2 4 7 5	3 6 6 3 6 4 4
so because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and they um	6 6 6	6 6 6
to such a degree but	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6
plus the training involved	6 2 4 6	6 3 4 4
i have have	3 6 6	3 6 6
and the kids in bible talk about anything but training	6 2 4 4 3 6 6 3 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
the man told me i needed a master cylinder	2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6
is is the greatest gardening soil	6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 4
whole lot of stuff going on out there	7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
we only spent two nights there	3 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
a convicted felon	7 5 5	3 6 6
well how do you feel about capital punishment	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
incredible logistics	2 4	6 6
sometimes you do do like to see the mirrors laughter-on laughter-the laughter-wall	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
so i said okay	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
the whole day without hearing anything	2 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4
there are a lot of buildings very close to each other	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
i have uh very little regard for the law	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
that that that that a good idea	6 6 3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 1 6 6 4
i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
so and how do you feel about it	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
and what you can do	6 7 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
tuition assistance	2 4	6 6
but it it been a pleasure talking with you	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6
well considering you moved here from california i guess	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
oh no	6 6	6 6
it looks like a little shot gun house almost	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
are they driven by themselves	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
crashed and	6 6	6 6
well i myself would would want to be on the jury like that	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
or was that just vacation or something	6 6 3 6 7 2 3	3 6 6 6 4 6 4

and try and earn those things	6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
that that the one	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6

but it it a different kind	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
well do do give too much credit to the american public for their motivational ability	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 1 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4

they were doing some uh ozone testing	3 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
and then when you get one of those	6 6 6 3 6 7 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean there there there there a sense of priorities here too	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 2 4 4 4
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
i ive ive watched that sisters a couple of times	6 3 1 6 2 4 7 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
ye shall be treated fairly	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4

i mean here it is just a real big deal	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
most of it was uh	7 2 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i teach school	3 6 2	6 6 6
and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
but if youre youre going to tell the kids they can-	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
of course you know theyre theyre theyre theyre playing it up real big that it was	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
there there that type of segregation huh	6 6 2 4 4 7 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
ive ive made	6 6 6	3 1 6
but the deficit	6 3 1	6 3 6
there there some nice stuff over there to see	6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
oh that is that is the most precious movie	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
you know once they they have been arrested	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4

that that	3 1	3 1
were you northern california	6 3 6 6	6 2 4 4
the states now establish uh do do have enough money	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 3 1 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
can be sentenced to the death sentence	2 4 4 4 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
and i was like	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because1 they want to	6 2 4 6 6 2 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 7 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 6
because1 i have a stepson now who who twenty	6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1 7	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
um if you you can call up eight eight eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get um	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i think so too	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away	7 5 5 6 7 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6
and then	6 6	6 6
drug trafficking they just kill you	2 4 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
so there goes the carburetor	6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4
that that the way it is at my daughter daughter nursery school too	3 1 2 4 6 2 4 3 1 1 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
are responsible about use of guns uh	6 6 6 7 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
a unfair advantage as they were	7 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
i do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
where they could could do that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
we do do have one	3 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6
i do	3 6	6 6
they- they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 7 5 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean there was nothing	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6
and theyre theyre both remarried	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
hometown baltimore	2 4	6 6
otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses you know from here to eternity	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
but they are real easy to grow	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6
theyre theyre really wonderful	2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6
and uh i think that uh	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
theyre theyre uh	6 6 6	3 1 6
and- and theyre theyre playing now during the summer months	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
well it it seems as if in the past typically there have been a	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6
my um	6 6	6 6
we do do have anything right now	3 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
something like that	3 2 3	6 6 6
well he does a lot of like um	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4
is this open and shut you know like you were saying	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
were were probably making a comparison against uh some european and uh	3 1 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 6
wish i could vote on more things frankly	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
well i i sometimes wonder if i did did mess up	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 6
that was a good one	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
well i had heard a couple of people	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and um im im pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in ohio and indiana- indiana about it and pennsylvania maybe pennsylvania	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
do you work with ti ti	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
he he out of there	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4
well he he got seven layers of shingles up there	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
off one another	6 3 1	6 6 6
i mean wed wed done everything we could to keep out the weather	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4
one at a time	3 2 4 4	6 6 2 4
but technically people most people	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
and then youre youre always	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
and then thered thered be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 6 7 5 3 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 4
im im not old	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
well that that what ours did	6 3 1 1 1 6	6 3 6 2 4 6
of witch hunt that is you know	7 5 5 3 7 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
have- we have a lot of	6 3 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 2 4 4
that that why ive ive ive ive really started to try to to pay off mine and get	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
but to me texas see and kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
ended up	6 6	6 6
i believe that we have to have a military	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 2 4
because1 if that that what if that that what the punishment is	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean it it a little dinky town	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
sometimes it is is	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
or purchasing	2 4	6 6
and too many kids do do care	6 7 5 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and i suppose that	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh she had visited a store there	6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and we have um of course started drug testing um	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
but it it um it it a really good movie	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
um one of the things they talked about was uh	6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6
we uh	6 6	6 6
um maybe six hundred bulbs	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
i ca ca remember what the town was some little area	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
what are the	7 6 6	6 6 6
uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
both commercial and residential	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4
so she is pretty much	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
but i think about um about a year ago um i bought	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
that is interesting	3 6 6	6 6 6
she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 6
and this is something that had been going on for months	6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know that a cat would do that uh	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
give him uh	2 3 2	6 6 6
i suppose i do because ive ive seen a lot of those changes	3 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
but then for	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it uh being	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and he has tried to bite me for two years	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
maybe when youre youre there in the room- in the courtroom yourself and youre youre sitting there and youve youve got to make a judgment on somebody	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 3 1 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
five um	6 6	6 6
the other the other thing that	6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
just because of the	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
how much money you make a week to uh	2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6
i mean by that i mean	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
it seems that we are failing in	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice	7 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
two thousand and one was a good movie if you had read the book	3 1 1 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so you think that	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
it it	6 6	3 1
we have enough	3 6 6	6 6 6
a son who who a sophomore in college up in massachusetts at uh amherst	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 2 7 5 2 7 5 2	6 6 3 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
that was the whole problem	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
too high	6 6	6 6
one crook is as good as the other one	7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
uh dances uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
i i have a sister-in-law from israel	6 3 6 7 5 5 2	6 3 6 2 4 4 4
and it does does become fun anymore	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
they have	3 6	6 6
but i just would rather have uh a man doing some of these jobs than a woman	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
guaranteed acceptance by uh american express	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 4 4 4
we have the duty to pay taxes	3 6 3 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they had summoned eight hundred people	2 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
oh so	6 6	6 6
that are about- our age	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
i would think so	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
you like	3 6	6 6
you know without getting sued	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
it about seven hours	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6

but we do have	6 7 6 6	6 3 6 6
ive ive never i have have gotten one	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7	3 1 6 3 6 4 6 6
you know can you imagine	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4
and uh the shadow of blooming grove	6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 2 4 2 4 4
that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in laughter-this country too	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
is just uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
thatll thatll tie you down a little bit	3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6
about twenty miles away from us	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and when i got up there the car	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
well not so much pay	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
not an obstetrician an	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
say ten dollars	7 5 5	6 6 6
and one of the things the questions the other day this last paper and i have have seen the results of it im im anxious to was do you think that um capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 3 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 1 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4
i know	3 6	6 6
i you know im im im im not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
oh that would be a nightmare	6 3 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 2 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
uh washing machine	7 5 5	6 6 6
i do do think i would have gone on unless i had that financial	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
i guess i it	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i think i like a lot	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean that that a	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i um	6 6	6 6
and were were like well why do do we go see this now	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
soon as we wind up uh	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
all the places that i had left for him	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and you do do go to baseball games as much	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and i mean the light would still come on	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
but texas uh adopts statewide statewide all the way through the twelfth grade	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
but it it nice having a dog here uh	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6
just waiting it out	2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6
well i can tell you that the mets opened i think two days ago	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
uh i wish we did	6 3 6 2 6	6 3 6 6 6
the rumor im im not really sure if it it true or not that uh were were not spending	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 4
i mean most people out there committing murders like do do care	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6
i used	6 6	6 6
that that pretty sad because	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
like my son is in uh	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
i know	6 6	6 6
i was eleven or twelve i think when we first got	3 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
so im im sure he knew	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
put put more guys more cops higher visibility	6 6 7 5 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
but they had	6 3 6	6 6 6
now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
oh i have a six year old	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 4
it it like there	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
in the street you know	2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and it it the honest citizens like ourselves that	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
uh by uh	7 5 5	6 6 6
i mean i have been to new york	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well yeah- yeah	6 6 6	6 6 6
the way that they have been treated over the years	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
youre youre not president bush	3 1 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6
well you should of just ripped the whole thing out	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
and so uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know few days	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
uh that only the most wealthy can do so	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that	7 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3
but it is not any worse	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
do you have any idea	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
when the guy came over	6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
kind of a purply blue red	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
but the uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
there are a lot of	6 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 6
what it translated into was	3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
that that	3 1	3 1
so i tried to have a goldfish	6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
i do do even know who won the	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they do do	6 6 6	6 6 6
because i- i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i knew was	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4
and and again there there something else that- you know there was a	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you just came to the point where	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i i agree that there are there are um	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
is there anything	6 6 3	6 6 6
there there plenty of money in the system	6 6 7 2 4 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
in the paper one you have to separate	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
well some of them yes they do	6 7 2 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
but back to gardening	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4
i mean they have a training center where they teach them	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 3	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6
there there yeah there there a few designs i guess ive ive done myself but not very many	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 7 5	3 1 6 3 1 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and that you know you ca ca just send someone off to washington	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
in cocoon	6 3	6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
like japan still	6 2 6	6 6 6
the fact that	7 5 5	3 6 3
i do do know much- that much about it	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3
and i loved it	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
is it off of near country club	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 4 4
so maybe that part of it would be helpful too	6 6 3 1 2 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
you know make a sauce with or something like that	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 4 6 6
and bye	6 6	6 6
is is it like uh	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
in order to put	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
uh criminals there are more policemen	7 5 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
oh he does	6 3 6	6 6 6
inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 3 1 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
so were were we take trips pretty often	6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
are mostly brick	6 2 4	6 6 6
not to toot my own horn here or anything but i- i was	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6
i understand this	3 6 3	6 6 6
because i think my car	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i guess so	3 6 6	6 6 6
very few you know	7 5 6 7	6 6 6 6
from- least what from what what on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4
we call it service merchandise	3 6 3 7 5	6 6 2 4 4
my voice	2 4	6 6
there there one big one that has come off	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the limits uh uh would i think have to do with what id id alluded to before that there needs to be a further um	2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 4
i would think it would be women that were working full-time	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
have children with who are or have been through the public school system	6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
anyway it it the only car that says	6 3 1 2 4 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it where all the executives are	3 1 6 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
you just have to	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre both females	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i started	3 6	6 6
test all they want for drugs you know	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6
and they think they have to	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
ive ive been	3 1 6	3 1 6
i know mine almost never did	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
he really should have hired people	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 4
positive reinforcement	2 4	6 6
i thought yeah right come tell me about it you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
but i never got to see his	6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation	6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
uh with some wood	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
my ex-husband was working downtown	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
i guess you just have to wonder	3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so what what	6 6 6	6 6 6
and it	6 3	6 6
this- this is the first time ive ive been called in a long time	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
i never asked him the other day how he was connected	3 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know wish that	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
there are lots of things that are involved there	6 6 7 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i had	3 6	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and they used to have a program called t news	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
and then out of that percentage only so many	6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
how about you	6 6 3	6 6 6
of course texas rangers being one of them1	6 6 2 4 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uneven sentencing	2 4	6 6
a hundred kilometers	2 4 4	3 6 6
ive ive	6 6	3 1
i think youre youre putting your child at a big disadvantage	3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
compensated for what were were doing right now	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6
well it was a political move	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
as a typist	6 7 5	6 6 6
and the the ground will filter some of it but not all of it	6 6 2 4 6 6 7 2 3 2 4 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 3
benefit from that are the lawyers	2 4 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6
on the legal system	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
there there an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there there a fly paper effect	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 7 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4
uh you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
so it was really that was really neat	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
the denial mechanism is really strong	7 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and then im im going to go to sulphur springs	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh they will	6 3 6	6 6 6
but they did did	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
it it very expensive	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
up here in the northeast we have um well we we have these mail order companies like ll ll bean	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
uh before uh	7 5 5	6 6 6
i i was	6 3 6	6 6 6
that was	3 2	6 6
i do do think theyre theyre is	3 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6
i know this	3 6 3	6 6 6
if you have the time	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
cope with them	6 6 3	6 6 6
oh i just thought of something we have to return	6 3 6 6 6 3 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
it it a contact sport	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
and they never	6 2 6	6 6 6
like that girl in new york that got beat up by you know when she was jogging	6 7 5 5 3 1 1 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
what do they get paid	7 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and i always give her a hard time	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6
so where do you live at	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
but when you get that much	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
we went to a uh	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely	7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
be able to be enforced	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
it it i i think it it probably more embarrassing and very painful	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 3 1 6 4 4 6 4 4
i think that that why they call me because1 they want to get people outside the state you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6
virtually everybody in the neighborhood that that their first homes	3 1 6 3 1 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 2 4 4
and uh does a lot of of	6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
more people in	2 4 4	6 6 6
you know i-	6 2 6	6 6 3
if him and his wife were were getting along	6 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and then see i did did cross stitch	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
where are you calling from by the way	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
and i think that that what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
we write a check	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
in fact she just turned sixteen years old new year year eve	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6
that that the one i was thinking of	3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
been involved	6 6	6 6
good point	7 5	6 6
a major distinction between	7 5 5 6	6 6 4 4
if theyd theyd been in day care the entire time and it was was	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you go to visit them	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
the guy was obviously guilty	3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 4 4
its its there is good reason to do it	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
and make that your second step because	6 6 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
you leave your car for ten minutes	3 6 2 4 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
and i	6 6	6 3
so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes	2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
they they bring things home	6 2 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
um he was in the untouchables too	6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
obviously not on the original time schedule	6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
the violence that	2 4 3	3 6 6
i maybe maybe seeing them um	3 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
and channel thirteen theyre theyre really	6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
but it turns out that uh foster actually uh ghost wrote it for him	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 6
it is scary	3 6 6	6 6 6
in the city	2 3 1	6 6 6
oh how nice	6 6 6	6 6 6
i think virginia virginia got it	3 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
to the fours and some of the sixes	6 2 4 4 7 2 4 4	6 3 4 6 6 3 1 6
well as	6 6	6 6
and it it uh i guess a lot more ecological- ecological to just	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
poor blacks for example vote very little	7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
there are some smaller	6 6 7 2	6 3 6 6
that that unusual	3 1 6	3 1 6
but i have have been down there	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
well it goes back to the again if you look at prohibition	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
well i guess in cases like that you know where the guy would	6 3 6 6 2 4 3 6 2 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
skidding control	2 4	6 6
laughter-that laughter-that for sure	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
plot it it total-	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
people do do tend to knock	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4
i mean my other pet peeve is unions	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 7	3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i do do think that that right	3 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6
can you do better this year	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 6
and and the schools do do do do really encourage	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 3 1 6 6
youre youre supposed to only want the job	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean good grief what what with	6 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
the problem is i ca ca guarantee that a	2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 3
and there there there there so many other things that i	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
i- i saw- saw an episode of the tv tv show cops	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 4 4 4
that that what i would think	3 1 1 1 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4
and then this there there this other one that that more up in the mountains	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 4
and i have have had too many problems with my car	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and this helps them to think	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive got a manual singled shot	3 1 6 3 1 1 1	3 1 6 6 4 4 4
and i have to admit i have a certain	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh what a mess	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
so i got it back	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 4
they just do do let you out	3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre supposed to	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
maybe they could give something	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4
forest lane and you know through that off off the freeway	2 4 4 6 2 4 3 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
she has twelve children	3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
most of my friends	7 2 4 4	6 3 1 6
well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation	6 7 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but- is it also	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
and then later this was actually funny	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
and now that will bloom all summer long	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal	6 6 6 7 2 4 6 2 6 2	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
you know especially when it it all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
people going into different fields	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
was my my uh	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
taking care of the environment is is all well and good	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
and the only problem was that uh	6 7 5 5 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 4 4 6
nice nice to get a refund	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4
my husband calls her street dog	2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
people are going you know feeling resentful	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 4
and once youve youve established the fact that youre youre not a drug user and	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
ive ive	3 1	3 1
county i live in in the past ten years only had two- two capital murders	3 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
in baltimore	6 3	6 6
i think there there lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
as highly regarded as men would be	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and she got it from the psych department	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
did you ever have her in child care	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
all of them1 are tested once every three months-	7 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3
because1 uh i guess we do do trust the school systems which is really sad	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
that that that that just the way it is	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 2	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
getting healthy	6 6	6 6
and i was over there recently	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
i i	6 3	6 6
well it it it it yeah it it a little bit like any other sport you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
as a part of the	6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
there there just been more of a turn toward	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and so	6 6	6 6
heinous crimes	2 4	6 6
it was it was beyond	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
id id like to see subsidy by the government or something or taxwise or something	3 1 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
were any of them twins	6 7 2 3 7	6 6 6 6 4
at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha	2 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i feel it	3 6 6	6 6 6
like a lot of them1 do	6 7 5 2 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
well what is your view	6 7 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
send them over to iraq	6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 4
not very much	6 6 6	6 6 6
really i- i- i do do think that that a valid argument	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6
perfect boxes to put files in	2 4 4 4 7 2	6 6 6 6 4 6
and and	6 6	3 1
but it it rather	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
and it told like uh you know where the first connally came over	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
i guess what they call it is eclectic you know	3 6 3 1 6 3 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6
they really	3 6	6 6
and then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 4
they do the whole	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that research really be directed	6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
treatment before for dismissal	2 7 5 2	6 6 6 6
oh id id say maybe	6 3 1 6 7	6 3 1 6 6
she ca ca play with it	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6
i personally know nothing about the peace corps though	3 6 6 3 7 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
really what happened to the steel industry in this country	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an	7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
new hampshire is fairly easy	3 1 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
i do do know if you all have those around	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
maybe well well talk again sometime	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
there there a lot of them out there that have have	6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
but um	6 6	6 6
laughter-oh laughter-are laughter-you laughter-also	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i stay at home	3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
i think theyre theyre looking after their own	3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
would be nice though	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i just go with those	6 3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
you know like in los angeles or or the bigger cities	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh my goodness	6 6 6	6 6 6
im im the same way	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 1 6
understand these people you know like when they they decide theyre theyre going to buy a gun to protect themselves	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
my um	6 6	6 6
i mean just because	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
kids with elderly people	2 6 2 4	6 6 4 6
you know there there there there there there a complete different set of values	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle	6 2 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
back in october to do some training for ti ti	6 6 2 6 6 7 5 5 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 3 6 4
they might work on that you know	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and that is a really good movie if you like special effects	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
talking about in washington is is the	2 4 4 3 6 6 7	6 6 6 4 6 4 4
well thank you	6 6 3	6 6 6
but basically	6 6	6 6
because he he got fairly regular hours since he came back	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
i saw it when i was a kid	3 6 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6
i was getting ready	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
how about1 yours	6 6 3	6 6 6
to be feared	6 6 6	6 6 6
in iowa the state im im from	6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i mean you you pulled stunts like that and	6 6 6 3 6 7 2 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
so we do do have any any children yet	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
um me either	6 3 6	6 6 6
they again i do do know really what steps there are that they	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6
and that is that	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
maybe top level	6 3 1	6 6 6
and you give them an f	6 3 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
you know it	6 6 3	3 6 6
like stay out	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it required by law	3 1 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 6
where he defines democracy- democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues	6 3 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
and losing one run games	2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
the chemical plants and things like that	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4 4
we can make some- some- making some more intelligent decisions	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
let me think	6 3 6	6 6 6
but sometimes	6 6	6 6
living in dallas there there not that many places to go shoot	6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
well i	6 6	6 6
and even- i work for texas instruments	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
especially with the real young ones	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6
too much in taxes	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4
and you think about that	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
teaching and the	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that uh those are carbon particles	6 6 6 2 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
and when uh difficult decisions uh are made uh uh uh they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
oh god	6 6	6 6
takes two weeks for that system to process	6 7 5 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
but he has has	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
random drug testing here	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
and i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
twelve people people hands	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
ill ill bet	3 1 6	3 1 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
it it	6 6	3 1
oh really	6 6	6 6
were you watching	6 3 6	6 3 6
now have you ever been to a professional football game	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
and now even the money that that been raised for the local districts is being	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
because as i say there is a there there a tremendous-	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
theyre theyre where they are theyre theyre not adapted	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
the burden should should be placed on the consumer	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4
minor part that kind of become like an afterthought	7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
maybe- maybe it was was that one	6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 3
and they call every month	6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6
nothing left but a stem	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
i um	3 6	6 6
you can learn on the job	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
but the leaves i do not like them1	6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6
there was a	6 6 6	6 6 6
they uh	3 6	6 6
that uh the what they call the latchkey children	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i live right across the street from a a big lake here um	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
are looking to	7 5 5	6 6 6
boy that that scary is is it	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but that that a whole different subject	6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 1 6 6
and now were were not were were not gonna gonna do it because everybody is beating us at the game	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
and i have a feeling that the persian gulf	6 3 6 7 5 5 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but youll youll stay there for twenty years	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
if you have a degree in a technical field	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
you know and i and i think that i- i agree with you	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
but i mean i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but we gained a	6 3 6 2	6 6 4 6
they wanted us to have	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
so it	6 6	6 6
i i like the way it is	6 3 6 2 4 3 2	6 6 6 3 6 2 4

she does	3 6	6 6
certainly have one	6 6 7	6 6 6
uh normal uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
but you need x number dollars to administer the program	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4
and probably- perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i would took i took and just mowed over them1 last year	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4

that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
the caught being good slips	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
one of these days my grandkids probably	7 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
i mean their politics really is is politics	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
attachment to it	2 4 3	6 6 3
and uh	6 6	6 6
laughter-that laughter-that laughter-where i would probably be	3 1 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
that that like everything else though	3 1 6 3 2 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
and how they would how they would last	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know failed them	6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6
and like you said save the commentaries	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 4
it it it good as in terms of in terms of uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
you know the the immediate need to	6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 6
and if you get one bad apple there there are at least other people that can see it	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
through the school	6 7 5	6 3 6
theyre theyre	6 6	3 1
you know	6 3	6 6
one of the uh the places and stuff	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
but i do do get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
revamping of the entire education system on that level- the public school system i want to see changed too	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
i had them1 walk out of my class and not say their name anything	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and i know	6 3 6	6 6 6
coming up and everything	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it took to get the work done you know	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
shell shell knock it over	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it	3 6 2 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i like	3 6	6 6
you know when it gets right down to it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
her father and three other guys up here in sherman	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
uh because1 that would	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
as many of the woman- as many of the men who are doing the same job i do	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
i do do know why	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
number of different criteria	2 7 5 5	6 6 6 4
vw rabbit	2 4	6 6
and it makes it makes for a a different challenge	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
fellow in this truck that kept circling the block	7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
that that that a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake	6 3 1 2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
because theyre theyre the people who know	6 2 4 4 4 3 2	6 3 6 2 4 4 4
and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
that that a person in a rural area	2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
the output from the united states was basically from smaller businesses	2 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
i guess everybody everybody in dallas that i talk to	3 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
what do you propose that they do	7 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
twenty thousand dollars a year if theyre theyre lucky	7 5 5 5 5 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the un un gets involved then it it nobody nobody business	6 6 2 6 6 3 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 6 3 1 1 1 2	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 2 4 4
and of course the big deal one of the big deals now too is to	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
i- if they could just	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
hang on to the one ive ive got for a few years because it it it it it it almost four years old	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 1 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 4
part of it is that we need to develop more of a of a pride in	2 4 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
well it it fun	6 3 1 7	3 6 6 6
a dealing with is like a credit bureau	7 5 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 3 6 6 4 4
what what what is that	6 6 7 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
can get their degree	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
i guess if it were if if	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 4 6
well you know that that exactly	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
uh mainly the blacks in the south and the hispanics were precluded by	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 4
and we	6 6	6 6
and im im not good enough to raise my child which basically is true	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
i do do know some things are sensationalized	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
but he you know is working at sam sam now	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 4 6
to let me know that she was unhappy with laughter-what laughter-i laughter-did	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
so eighty eighty years or so	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
well any time we had a school vacation or something like that	6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4
maybe it should go with a drivers drivers laughter-license	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 2	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 4 4
ive ive never done aerobics or any sort of structured	3 1 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
starting some sort of a military elitist type	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
but somewhere weve weve got to come up with some money	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
speaking of bush were were going to get a little off topic but speaking of bush	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
my mother mother uh	3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
my daughter brought home a book the other day	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
the eaves way up high and stuff	2 4 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies	7 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 3 6 2 4
for something sporty	6 3 2	6 6 6
offend them uh if they if they were were	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do too	3 6 6	6 6 6
as there is no real smoking gun	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
like they had eleven thousand harm missiles which ti ti is the sole supplier for	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
and if we men and women	6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
i mean i think ive ive read all four of them	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 6
because of the mosquitoes	6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
the reason they have the angolan heights and the	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
and you can make it ahead of time	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and people leave the door open you know while theyre theyre upstairs playing music	6 2 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 4
um something that	6 3 1	6 6 6
i do do really liken it	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
and still i ended up	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i i think	6 3 6	6 6 6
and so i go let-	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well not necessarily	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it beyond a reasonable doubt	3 1 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 4
really do do know what the other solution would be you know	6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
i want to go see that	3 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 4
i think that i think that that the way things work in pennsylvania	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4
i do do know which that answer is	3 6 6 6 3 7 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
good luck in your car hunting	7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
i know some senators	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
what i have have seen is the uh	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and theyre theyre trying to do that now with the imports	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
that that just not realistic	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
the whole thing is so incomprehensible you know	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that ive ive really gotten into reading	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 4
so have see that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
kind of almost stiff and youre youre not	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6
if i was going to go out and drink or do something i would would do it in front of my child	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
to determine exactly what the what the things are	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
to socialize not really to learn	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
every road sign you come to is like well i did did know i that far	2 4 4 3 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
you bet	3 6	6 6
i agree	3 6	6 6
all my income goes for	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
so i guess we have the	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
that sounds pretty good	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
enjoy- enjoy them	6 6 3	6 6 6
it it like rocky films	6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
and there there only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood antigen- antigen uh	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
wow where was where where was that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do	6 6	6 3
and just the air is so dry	6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and i have kids	6 3 6 7	6 6 6 6
bringing the little kitten over to uh to my folks	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
but um so i-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that will come about	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 4
and i did did	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i hope i do do see	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
and i was having my hair cut	6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
my husband husband in construction	2 4 4 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
id id rutherrather rather spend you know fifty cents less on uh on on such and such you know	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6
and i miss that	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
we had this group of uh surveyors come into uh a shop i was working in	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 6
uh they do it to prisoners	6 3 6 3 6 7	6 3 6 6 2 4
or well well suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4

oh no doubt	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it not where it necessarily is needed	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4
i mean it it not really government for the people and by the people	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
god maybe ill ill take it out	6 6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
but i did did know if it it been my color choice or multiple moves	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4

when when we had our family dog growing up	6 6 2 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and it it very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really are are	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6

for any forms of education	2 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
but otherwise	6 6	6 6
weve weve learned from it	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 6

those where you built like a rafter thing	3 2 3 2 4 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
so well written	6 6 6	6 6 6

at times i feel	6 7 3 6	6 6 6 6
you know what id id like to see a little more	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6
i think that that a good	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and and theyre theyre all a handful	6 6 3 1 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
the van pools i know that	2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
lots of kids	7 2 4	6 6 6
areas too	2 6	6 6
that that all they are	3 1 7 3 2	3 1 6 6 6
you might keep them	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
from committing any kind of	6 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 6
it it godfather three	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
i did it for six years	3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
we going to do with all the soldiers over there	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
uh the us us is is the threat that weve weve always made them out to be	6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
just about all by the porch	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
a child who is obviously very ready	2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
it it like it it like a kid	6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 1 6 6 4
and uh trying to make it through that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know and	6 6 6	6 6 6
a lot of uh	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
mid sixties	2 4	6 6
you know where you get around the edge	6 7 5 3 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
weve weve uh weve weve been married for about ten years	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4
so he had to	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
i you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 2 4 4
so unless you have actual you know across the boards boards uh limitations	6 6 3 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 3 6 4 6 4
the four bedroom	6 6 6	6 6 6
i think that that probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that ive ive ever read	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 1 1 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 3 3 1 6 6
now i also	6 3 6	6 6 6
well i would think he would	6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
there there a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is uh	6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 6 2 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 6
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
i- i work	6 3 6	3 6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
uh get one at at birth	6 6 2 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
well that that very good	6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
when i was growing up	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
and then all of the others i just try to use	6 6 7 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
are they like pretty much trained for a specific job	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
one of the big changes uh	7 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
of a toy poodle- a toy poodle	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
he he sometime	3 1 2	3 1 6
pretty much were taught how to be responsible	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
that she she not uh blacklist on uh	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
when i do um crochet it it usually the	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6
and i was tailing the woman that was killed	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
it it in the usually you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
in front of them	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
they they do when they deserve it	6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that- everybody that goes in there smokes	6 3 1 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
ive ive got ive ive got	6 6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 4 6
and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee	6 6 6 6 7 3 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
and theyre theyre all like um	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i read a book one time that said that	3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6
sure how to explain it	6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 4 6
rid of the dog	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
oh boy	6 6	6 6
so hopefully	6 6	6 6
i uh	3 6	6 6
but i did did think that was as good because it was like you know you could could really talk and stuff like you could when you was at the lake or somewhere you know where you were out	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 7 3 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
the real	2 4	6 6
i- i guess im im satisfied	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are	6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6
but uh in the first scene the warlock chopped off a guy guy finger because1 he wanted the ring and then	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
so i at first thought you know when i did did have kids	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
that that that that progress i guess	6 6 3 1 1 1 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6
but but maybe well well prevent a few john hinkleys	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6
than the six cylinder that i think was like about	6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
but they	6 3	6 3
but uh	6 6	6 6
not a lot i could do about it	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 2 4 7 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
it it going to have to be both	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
i i i think	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
you know well i guess i can just humor them you	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
oh that that nice	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
ive ive	6 6	3 1
you know if you had three you you know would say if id id of had four	6 6 6 3 6 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
have been over you know coming back right now you know	2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
well right now im im looking at a little	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
current affairs	2 4	6 6
a year before that had been turned down because1 they said well it it not feasible	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
so we we had um	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i read it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
they have not	3 6 6	6 6 6
that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 4
well we had the problem when i was in with teaching um	6 7 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that that really tremendously wrong with it	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 3
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
becoming a great power financially	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4
got teams like	6 2 4	6 6 6
what- the state that the world is in and try to guess where were were going	6 7 5 3 2 4 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
the movie oh	7 5 6	6 6 6
plants that are just spring bloomers	2 3 2 4 7 5	6 6 2 4 4 4
if you were good boy let let do do have you on our team you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
like shock	6 7	6 6
you still can see well	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
just bought one	6 6 3	6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
of course	6 6	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i wish i could	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
what do you mean where	7 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
ive ive well ive ive been home with a um	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
and that just	6 3 6	6 6 6
i do not have a real big front yard	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
well shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed uh	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
it it never ran	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i did did get to use them1 like oh	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that many people on that small of a space theyve theyve learned to live together	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately	6 6 7 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 3 7 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
you know we we do do there there lots of things that we do do get told	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
really scary to me	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
the sense of finding out information	2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 4
i read a lot	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i was trying to get my uh	3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
texas it	3 6	6 3
uh there there an area there where there was uh some texas uh	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
fixing power lines	2 4 4	6 6 6
and so it it like	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
oh great	6 6	6 6
the six cylinder	2 4 4	3 6 6
they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
or the or the jackets the team like the raiders and the caps	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
a republic not a democracy	2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4
the the fairly fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now theyre theyre theyre theyre enforcing	6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 3 4 4
ill ill let you go	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
it it going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it	6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 6 6
you were at a machine and working with somebody	3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
well do you even know what the procedures are now	6 6 3 6 6 3 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
to uh really do a	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
i could have gone tonight	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
there there	6 6	3 1
and its its	6 3 1	6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
they probably limit now	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
lacy victorian type	7 5 5	6 6 6
to recycle it	7 5 3	6 6 6
because i	6 3	6 6
politically motivated or whatever	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
some money from the bottlers and from the	2 4 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
they went down almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up gandhi	3 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
for cocaine possession	6 7 5	6 6 6
um and that that also happened to me where ive ive given money to my old alma mater in college	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 3 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 4
oh and i tell you what	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6
i think the high there there a higher percentage in in certain black areas of voters	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
cars i think are not made as well as they could be	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
only i got kicked out	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6

plus it it got a lot more people interested in it because you got to participate sort of	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
oh that that wonderful	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
oh shoot	6 6	6 6
well if you enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and do it and	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
it it on one floor	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
are you know are that alive on monday you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6
which i thought was a real interesting question	3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
the way people think about it	7 5 2 7 5 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
well i just i im im glad weve weve learned	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 3 1 6
well that that- that that will make their day	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6
i i never really watched the whole thing	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
they will they will eventually	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
how would it	6 6 6	6 6 3
no one is sure just how to handle i think	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
than than drugs so to speak	6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and you	6 6	6 6
was was it a woman	6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
or anything that would contribute	6 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 4
and again dad went through the whole thing	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
mother mother day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
to decide- you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it all so negative you know	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 6
and it it got	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
it it just because that i would be reminded every day	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
um they just stayed with different ones of them1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
so its its	6 6 6	6 6 6
in most cases	6 2 4	6 6 6
and god he got up on this elephant all by himself	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
and then there there other departments that are are	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and i do do need their	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6
when they were living in israel it was	6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
it was the schools and the	6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 4
that is neat	3 6 6	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh i think that uh that a player ought to hit a home run if he he got the pitch to do it	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4
our uh	6 6	6 6
i have	3 6	6 6
since of you know what they want to be or do	7 5 6 7 3 1 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
how i go about	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
if if im im not	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
and they uh	6 3 6	6 6 6
i need to	3 6 6	6 6 6
that are identical to mine	3 2 4 4 3	6 3 4 4 4
to eliminate	6 6	6 6
i mean i went up	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
see this is is a subject that i think a lot about because	6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
in intelligence school and about	6 2 4 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
a lot of things a lot of food	7 5 2 4 3 1 2 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4
i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went	3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 1 2	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
taking women from the teller and and	6 2 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and i thought im im going to end up on this elephant with him	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
carmakers had is slipping a little bit while american carmakers are trying to get their butt together	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i think theyre theyre going to go out and find it someway individual sale or something like that	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 3 2 3	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
even though the entire	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean i would think somebody would try to compete with that because1 it is very popular	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well considering what ive ive seen in the last uh you know two seasons im im beginning to agree with that	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
it it always over power issues	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
and so they get put in in in our school system in a	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 3
and it took us all of twelve hours	6 3 6 3 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
did puppy go to	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and the ground-	6 6 6	6 6 6
but it has been at least ten years	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
theyve theyve gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
what i understand from some of the guys i know crime	3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
oh of everything	6 6 3	6 6 6
theyre theyre going to other neighborhoods from there	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
they keep them yeah keep them clean	6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
there is is going to be any of this	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it was just that the	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
he put himself through college working in restaurants	3 6 3 6 2 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
we also do do make the uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
a lot of the road signs and everything are in	7 5 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
but and	6 6	6 6
you know this is the way it it going to be	6 6 3 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3
i mean the book is is chilling	3 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 2 4 4 4 4
uh more popular then it has been for a while i think	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
south for high school i was just repeating what id id already done	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 3 1 6 6
either unemployed and do do care about a uh just a have their own problems	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
i think that um	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
minor league baseball i think is a lot more laughter-fun than major league baseball-	2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 6
for their room and board	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
what could they possibly be thinking	3 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4
um the trend is going more towards single parenting	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh a lot of those boundaries	6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6
and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
that that for sure	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and um his adaptations are usually really good	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and i	6 3	6 6
um his father	6 2 4	6 6 6
and it was basically for the social atmosphere	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
not that i have an arsenal or anything	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4
it it either	6 6 6	3 1 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
i mean he has always got some kind of	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3
because1 all you end up doing is if youre youre in	6 7 3 7 5 5 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
but uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh	6 6 6 6 7 5 3 2 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6
then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
and traffic slows down to nothing	6 2 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4
they have the mirrors	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
that that me too	3 1 1 6	3 1 6 6
well you know i had had either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from cleveland ohio	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
oh good	6 6	6 6
used to be when you had a	6 6 6 6 3 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
have you seen that	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
theyre theyre all pretty fancy	2 4 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
ive ive	3 1	3 1
and that that fairly recent	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
ill ill uh normally check out the	3 1 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
like i uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question	2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
where were were just forced to	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
in fact it it said that no indian language has a word for privacy	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 4
it was	6 6	6 6
so if you were to improve it	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 4 6
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it already a hundred degrees	6 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 4
where i put things	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
what do we think about a judge making the decision	7 6 3 6 6 7 5 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
it is	3 6	6 6
you know everybody everybody following the same pattern	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
because uh you know i- i do also myself believe in capital punishment uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
but there there not very many options on that car	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
and i probably get more exercise than your average person	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
most of the ones you know up north and everything do	2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
that is so	3 2 4	6 6 6
it may be my phone	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
that that one positive on a drug test would not	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
you i was	6 3 6	6 6 6
their friends that are dealing drugs or or there parents	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
for you to do that	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
oh man	6 6	6 6
i moved to kansas city	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
my truck is broken laughter-down	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
but uh but basically uh there there lots of things that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
boy wed wed like to get back over to the east coast	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
is is is is maryland where the famous willy horton case was	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
little relief	7 5	6 6
and i i think that we learned from that	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
they do do exist anymore	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
that the following year	6 2 4 4	6 3 4 6
ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
they either you know drove you out in the woods	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
it it would just depend	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
you know they even get a	6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6
it it it not worth	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
he the beagle died in i guess about october	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
and they have to	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
ive ive	3 1	3 1
is it	6 3	6 6
and then he he running into marlon brando	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
apparently not	6 6	6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
to get that all of that mess off of my account	6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
know you create a bigger	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
i wish i did	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
a tendency that people uh may get into then i guess i do do really have a problem with it	7 5 3 2 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
trying to work	6 6 6	6 6 6
i just thought he was really inept	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i- i can say there there a correlation	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
gets pretty expensive	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
i was uh teaching	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
um but	6 6	6 6
uh shoot	6 6	6 6
you would think that those would come out	3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know im im a good hunter	6 6 3 1 2 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 4
the democrats were the doves	3 1 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4
uh i think it it	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
because then youre youre youre youre coming in contact with it	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 4 6 2 4 6 3
all right	6 6	6 6
and it it not random	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
and uh the uh properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes not the cheap ones of course	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 3 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
where am i	6 6 3	6 6 6
but you know i did did think it was as good as all the uh hype was about it	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 3
you know and stuff	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was	6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 3 1 6	6 3 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
oh off and on for twenty years	6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
they get it at school and come home	3 6 3 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
sometimes when i if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 2 4 4 6 6 4
not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
i had had uh had had not gotten any calls here in the last uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6
any other problems	2 4 4	6 6 6
are you going to go to east texas	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
next year	2 4	6 6
they certainly do well for those who go to the	3 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
there is so much plastic	6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4
you could say im im in baltimore	3 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
but prices in plano there is is um	6 2 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
like the idea	6 7 5	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
oh i do too	6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6
they make it really easy for people to uh to get credit cards especially college students	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
uh the more	6 2 4	6 6 6
full grown dog	2 4 4	6 6 6
it it it it basically the the problem is within the	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
so it it really building up	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
have you painted something lately	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
the quiet ride	2 4 4	6 6 6
and theyve theyve got some great big bins there for	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but sadder than that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
um that is is the same in the washington area because we do do have any	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
you let them1 out and let them1 fly around everything	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
that is probably one of the most bizarre i have heard of	3 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
other than that they were pretty much	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
neither side wants that	2 4 6 3	6 6 4 6
and it was really funny	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
uh that i should do it	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
it it just that sometimes it it not the right people	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i see	3 6	6 6
someone who who being	3 1 1 2	6 6 6 6
i like-	3 6	6 6
saint jack or something	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
because theyre theyre	6 3 1	6 6 6
i usually just buy a pattern book	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4
cases like that they should	2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
and his old day care as much as i loved it you know	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
i do do know maybe about thirty or forty movies	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
we all carry them1	3 7 6 2	6 3 6 6
it affects your family	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
if youre youre going to drink and you may drink	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
it definitely has changed	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
towed it up there because it you know would would start or anything	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
because you know you	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it gets people to uh doing it you know	3 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
well i heard that that- san antonio	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know if its its	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and and weve weve got the lowest rates of civilized countries in science and math	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
but i do do want	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
it it mostly the private information that were were all concerned about	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 4 4
very much so	6 6 6	6 6 6
he is gone	3 6 6	6 6 6
so i you know	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3
i sometimes watch tv tv if i-	3 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
turning off my	6 6 6	6 6 6
where theyve theyve now made all toy guns-	2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
laughter-i just like them1	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
but i	6 6	6 6
but there really is only about a half a dozen uh things	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know if you start talking about miles theyd theyd look at you like what	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 3 1 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
in second grade	6 2 4	6 6 6
i- i do do mind baking at all	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
started telling everybody that	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and we make experts by reading books	6 3 6 2 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
uh and yet there are there are so many there are so many people in prison	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
on channel thirteen that was broadcast i think last week or so ago	7 2 4 3 7 5 3 7 2 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
if that was football or	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
and they were were	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
so that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
oh that that	6 6 6	6 6 6
like it it a flag	6 3 1 7 5	6 3 1 6 6
maybe a shorter	6 2 4	6 6 6
i really could could	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
true person anyway	2 4 6	6 6 6
and i come here quite often	6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession	3 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but um	6 6	6 6
they are called cabbage cabbage loppers or whatever	3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive actually ive ive known known some people that have had their cars stolen	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it probably a lot worse now	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i realize that hed hed like his career to develop	3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
fall but the year after that	2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 2 4
is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should	6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 7 5 2 4 3 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4
uh everybody has to put in so many hours of	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
but even with that many years between	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
they had some real fancy names for them	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
and and also the suspension can be raised	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
i saved paper- you know i recycle paper	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
we you know they told us we just had to have one	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
uh a nineteen seventy cutlass supreme that she has	6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
i forgot about laughter-jazz	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
well no	6 6	6 6
i mean they should be able to go back and find out if youve youve had any kind of psychiatric record	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
there there a difference	6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6
im im in	6 6 6	3 1 6
most of them really are are that pretty	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
so see there you	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean they were	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and are you talking about	6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
this has been an interesting thing to do	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4
it it quite different than it was before	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that the thing	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
and i do do read any parents magazines either	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i think that uh the	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 4 6
i- i think that that very important	6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
im im a college teacher	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 4
you know i say well you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 4
a texas accent	2 4 4	6 6 6
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
then- then- then why not	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
some of the outer areas	7 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
you know first an alphabet is developed	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i mean when we moved in we had no idea how bad it was	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well as a matter of fact i just	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
in the last three years it it happened at least once a year if not twice	6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
well let let just say he was one of those types that you would would doubt that he was selling something	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
i mean uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
when you get down closer in to the newer track homes	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know but we got to sit by first base	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
is like every other state	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
uh have	6 6	6 6
so i like uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and that i know is run by the state	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
and and you know the pay pay regular	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
there is snow on the ground	6 6 2 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4
i ca ca really see why anyone	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
what what that	7 5 3	3 1 6
day care has just done	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
uh service	2 4	6 6
that that exactly right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
the one thing i do object to about rap music is is	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 3
and it finally died	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i know they automatically	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
and then she left that to get a position with the democratic party	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i grew up right here in falls church right outside dc dc	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4
but my car is getting old	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
it it it it kind of tied to her	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 3 1 6 2 4 6 4
families are such a strange configuration anymore	2 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i kind of feel the opposite though	3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4
uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 6
any of the recycled products	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
especially if your personality	6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
it did did matter	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
trying to you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
hi wanet	6 7	6 6
i- i- i actually i live in the city	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4
they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting you know	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
they talk about it as a	3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
and it was before i mean this was before we even met	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
to renting somebody else else	6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
well the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as im im concerned	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6
and thirty cents a liter	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for	3 2 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i mean i think you	6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
basically is the extent to which our	6 6 7 5 5 3 7	6 6 2 4 6 6 6
and i think if somebody ever does break in	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
uh a lot of time	6 7 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6
he did have a problem uh	3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
but now i could not go back and do it	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
and uh so it it had that orientation for quite sometime sometime	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
you wonder okay how much money do we need	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
had some really major health problem	6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 4 4 4 4
with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 2 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 4
uh no	6 6	6 6
you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because theyre theyre too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff	6 7 5 5 5 2 3 2 4 7 5 5 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
to get in and out of the city	7 5 5 5 5 5 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
that that not bad	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
he can walk	3 6 6	6 6 6
thatll thatll happen	3 1 6	3 1 6
i do do really care for snow peas	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and he he really the only one that i know of personally	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
because i guess they ca ca raise that money in those those poorer districts	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
but that that one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing	2 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
unfortunately when we were doing that	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6
and uh it it funny how uh how i i uh i	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 4 6 6
it it just not it just does does seem right	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
how do you feel about that	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
as far as this country is concerned	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well um	6 6	6 6
and it had	6 6 6	6 6 6
um so	6 6	6 6
it would never be equal	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
these people are middle class people just like us	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6
and they send me and	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and then they go back to work on monday	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
have you	6 3	6 6
and that that where i get get into the problem with with him	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and they work all day	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
the previous job i used to have	2 4 4 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
so im im ive ive been real pleased with the quality of the news we get	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
are they booked up	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
a pretty scary thought to me even	7 5 5 5 5 3 7	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
but what did we do	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
i mean theyre theyre really they they go bend over backwards servicewise for you	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
have weekly meetings and everything	6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and maybe they was a group of mennonites or something like that	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 7 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6
last thing	6 6	6 6
last year the uh lotus development company the uh company that puts out one two three	3 1 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 4 6 4
that that that that far back as i can remember	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it a place my girlfriend girlfriend also wanted to go	3 1 2 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 2 4
what i mean how to train them so theyre theyre going to be a blessing	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
they could not pitch	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
of course youre youre gonna just gonna pick everything up that you can carry	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4
well i think i guess nowadays with the uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
for a while	6 7 5	6 3 6
my husband	2 4	6 6
it all came down they just	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
if you want if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday birthday after	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 4 4
but after that	6 6 3	6 6 6
or people	6 2	6 6
you know you ca ca roll around and	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and i kind of got	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
just like he needs everybody elses elses you know	6 6 3 6 3 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
now see that that what you got to do see	6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
for them to thaw out	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
type people	2 4	6 6
it it not as comfortable a living	3 1 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
they have to pay like some kind of fee per year	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
but yeah	6 6	6 6
right about the same time or after	2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 4 4 4
so we we went back and tried it again	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
it was good	3 6 6	6 6 6
those who made under a certain amount would would owe any taxes	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 4 6 6 4
that thered be	2 6 2	6 6 6
capital punishment	2 4	6 6
especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
you know one that was going on	6 2 4 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
rather than that she has to have the money particularly	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it has deer and trees	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
on the other end back into education but not	6 2 4 4 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
that take them1 back	3 6 2 6	6 6 6 6
i thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than adults-	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 6
they said they were using um	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
i mean one of the things that can come out of uh	6 6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
who are totally prepared to teach- to teach your child everything they need to know in day care	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
that that what i mean	3 1 1 1 6	3 1 6 6 6
one- one of the reasons that we could get uh one of the reasons that it is lower in the united states is that mostly we hold it on tuesdays	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
there are other people that feel the same way	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that sounds to me more like the front office problem than	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
a really nice place	2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6
beat a push for the death penalty	6 7 5 5 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and the light would come on	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
so they can get their goods in here	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6
laughter-you laughter-know i mean you ca ca please them1 one way or the other	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
seems like it	6 6 3	6 6 6
you know wed wed start with the bb bb gun deal you know	6 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i do most of my reading in the bathroom	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
i do do care what anybody tells you	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
of recycling	2 4	6 6

you know	6 6	6 6
that that interesting	3 1 6	3 1 6
i say down	3 6 6	6 6 6
and if there needs to be a change in a period of time	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4
-sometimes i watch that	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
oh i do do know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6
you know yeah	6 6 6	6 6 6
so when i went to my first year of tech school	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
they probably did did know what they were talking about	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
there is a girl	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
so the school systems can improve	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
and i understand that there there a fifth	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels	6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
id id say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
i do do read a lot of nonfiction	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
on topics that would have three different competing proposals	7 5 3 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
that was one of the places i had checked out	2 6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
she had to go back to work	3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i had a friend in college-	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
i guess i you know the best example or	2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and theyre theyre giving speeding tickets	6 3 1 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6
one of the news stations i could could even tell you which one i watched	7 5 5 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but on the other hand im im not sure what the permanent value of it was	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 7 5 5 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
it it just	3 1 6	3 1 6
and then some of them are	6 6 7 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
they said that how	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well things are doing pretty good down here	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
he lives in cleveland	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4
and religiously	6 6	6 6
jobs that are	2 3 2	6 6 6
and i would go in	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
more collie and shepherd than chow	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
teams in your area	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
it must be fun to be able to play it	6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6
k or something like	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
like in dallas i mean theyve theyve had	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6
then that that pollution	6 3 1 7	6 3 6 6
and i assume that they would vote differently	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
had uh	6 6	6 6
do you think more should be done or something else	6 3 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
plus it gets them out of their hair	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and ive ive been raised around	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i understand a little bit about the texas rangers	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
they were i was listening to some of the comments on radio- television the other day uh about it	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
and uh when the politics	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
we all lived on base	2 7 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
just because1 that way i know what what wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really does does	6 6 3 1 1 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4
you do do really have any privacy at all	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i know i saw yeah something about it	3 6 3 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3
for the audi dealer	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
and there was did did seem to be anything else on i wanted	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 6 3 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
or the	6 2	6 3
but i want	6 3 6	6 6 6
oh it makes a huge difference	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
at a what what going on	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
but his company is is closing-	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do	3 6 6	3 6 6
and so	6 6	6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
it it a real it is a real nice facility	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so she she going to sell it rather than trade it in	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and im im not really sure that that weve weve gotten our money money worth there	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 4 4 4
i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a laughter-shotgun	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
i i i think	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it it it it solid limestone	6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 3 1 6 6
but still a lot of them does does feel comfortable doing that	6 6 7 5 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4
go to college etcetera	6 6 2 6	6 3 4 4
in graduate school	6 2 4	6 6 6
no we got the ball back	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and we did did want them	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
of hyacinths	6 2	6 6
what what your uh feeling	7 5 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4
is- is- a real- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i- i forgot that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6
so you bought a pontiac	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
i kept waiting for	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
peoples peoples names sorted by	2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
and you wait for the longest time really bored	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
in some ways we as parents had more control over	2 7 5 3 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
uh movie adaptations and things like that	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i work in school	3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
what what going to happen when she gets there	7 5 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
there there a tv tv and a vcr vcr vcr	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6
put the paper down and i mean just started from scratch	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
i think there there there there a	3 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh so many people from some	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and so during the school year i just do do have time to read	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and and there there	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective	6 6 3 7 5 5 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 6 2 4 4
and he he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
well no	2 4	6 6
i guess im im not	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 3
and i disagree	6 3 6	6 3 6
my god i think itd itd be next year is what id id read	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6
they had to they had to raise uh community college taxes here	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 2 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
i was an alternate on the case	3 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
some of them1 were even laughter-better laughter-behaved	7 2 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
oh does he really	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
uh the only way it can change is um	6 7 5 5 3 7 5 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
and then	6 6	6 6
they had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it uh	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
so were were watching the game	6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
that that exactly it	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i mean everybody everybody got to do it	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
uh well i do do actually live in the city	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and i had had even thought about that uh the the other end of that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6
but it	6 6	6 6
well that that about five minutes	6 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
i- i should imagine that	6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
well you know what theyve theyve started doing is is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
im im not really that great at it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3
and i	6 6	6 6
like i feel like right now i feel like this country has been behind this war	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 4
harder to convict somebody	6 6 6 3	6 6 4 4
well im im sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
and the other will be going in september	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
sounds like us	6 6 7	6 6 6
and was i was the first one	6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 4
but i mean you just think to yourself	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and she she never been curious	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
kind of a central location	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4
and there there something	6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6
and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them1 taken out of the schools	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 3 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
dealt with that in a sense	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
dispensed with these distinctions	6 6 3 1	6 3 6 4
she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now	3 6 3 1 1 1 7 2 4 4 3 7 5 5 5 5 3 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
he hooked it up right	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
oh yes	6 6	6 6
put him in	6 3 6	6 6 6
what is it now	7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
she she gorgeous	3 1 6	3 1 6
put all the money into the expansion box and	6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
i think there there been	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 1 6
ill ill do that	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
but uh this is out in west texas	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i have experience with this because i work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man	6 3 6 7 5 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i mean if it it true	6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 3 1 6
uh was	6 6	6 6
i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
made the call	6 2 4	6 6 6
and i i think i liked the other movies he he done	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
but it	6 6	6 3
you know some people on the case were	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6
but i just have have fit it into my schedule yet	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
fifty or something like that	2 4 3 2 3	6 3 4 6 6
id id say right around six maybe seven years	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
so was i	6 6 3	6 6 6
that that sort of the old testament version	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
but um	6 6	6 6
real thick gauge stuff i mean	7 5 5 5 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6
i think that that all that they have	3 6 3 1 7 3 1 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
you can have a classical look	3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6
and then they they give you uh uh	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
um i work in the computer lab at school	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
but i- i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the town north mazda right off central	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
is it registered	6 3 6	6 3 6
that that kind of	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
named rosebud	2 3	6 6
very poor	6 6	6 6
if if you have	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4
i think tv tv is bad because1 they uh show all sorts of violence on	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
im im you know like	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
that the	6 6	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that taller but not as big around	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
in high school were kind of lazy and all	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so there there a big difference	6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 1 6
that you	3 1	6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
and there there one really bad scene where it it i mean there there not blood but it it	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
the part	3 1	6 6
you know my parents do do hardly use them	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6
i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6
water called clearly canadian	2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6
or to put their child into a setting- into a home setting where they would	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
basically it	6 6	6 6
and some people would get civilian	6 2 4 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 4
you are legal in in your circumvention of that law	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 2 4
but business is	6 6 6	6 6 6
and just basically state by state events that led to the events that brought about the civil war	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 2 4 3 2 4 3 1 1	6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
role models of uh of tough guys and gangsters and things like that	7 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 2 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 6
in miles per hour	3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
females in the class	2 4 3 1	6 6 2 4
but really if	6 6 6	6 6 6
so they just about complicated the things so much that	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
what do you think of that uh	7 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
motor down	2 6	6 6
the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of	2 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
ive ive ive ive not really had that many problems with it	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
uh you in a nice neighborhood	3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
well you are going to have to find a mother mother day out and have him call in sick one day	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
i- i was trying to remember	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh what what your feeling about that	6 7 5 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
it it it it generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
um you know some time day care is really good	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6
what i also think that	3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
i have	3 6	6 6
uh and and you know some people might not believe that	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
really housing is real bad	6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i i think that in the future youre youre i think youre youre going to see a lot more	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
or sign up for it	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
where the	2 4	6 6
watching the news	6 2 4	6 6 6
something on the order of fifty thousand people	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 3 4 4 4
she would would hit- you know harm them1 at all	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
the only	6 6	6 6
um the freshwater tank tank just	6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
it just may overwhelm us	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
like this is like early seventeen hundreds through	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
theyve theyve always been	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
it sounds like iowa or something	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6
i think i think that	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
so theyre theyre going to by	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
out of it all the time	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
and they really do do listen to any of the issues anymore	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
course i guess i guess ive ive been purged from their records	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
they do do mess around very much	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
with a conviction	6 2 4	6 6 6
almost a hundred percent	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 4
i do do have the patience to read	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but im im from the dallas area	6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 4
i had a charge with uh spiegel	3 6 2 4 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
one of the things we were told is	7 2 4 4 3 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
so i finally ended up giving it back to him	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
it it big enough for us though	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
it it	6 6	3 1
i do	3 6	6 6
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve laughter-months	3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
that that a little steeper	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4
i just do do	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and he he you know	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
did did have	6 6 6	3 1 6
and um	2 4	6 6
as far as the the materials	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean they just it can rack up a a hundred fifty k on them1	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3
get that	6 2	6 6
show that i listen to going to work in the morning	7 3 1 7 5 5 5 2 7 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 4
and then we just	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
there there	6 6	3 1
at the time you hired on with this company uh was that prior to any	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
one of the reasons is	7 2 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 6
you know were were	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
you know look really	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
where the campsite it- it- so	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6
fun trying to retrieve her	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 4
and im im a substitute teacher	6 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6
i could could	3 6 6	3 6 6
and finally a guy gets up there and blast a home run	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
from ti ti	6 2 4	6 6 6
and i will not do my oil changes	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
and if youre youre up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment	6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
theyre theyre blurred	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and it it going to take these young	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
normal pressures	2 4	6 6
were were changing departments	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
uh reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 4
or it can be	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and he said that that not a new master cylinder	6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
to surmise it is there	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and that	6 3	6 6
that they	3 1	6 6
complete dark all day long	6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6
and- and top level	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
what what that	7 5 3	3 1 6
and the local-	6 2 4	6 6 6
and did did understand it	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
but uh it it uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh i think i know who you are talking about though	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
well you know they they that that what they said about the exorcist you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 3
to to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over-	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6
normally i	6 3	6 6
theyve theyve gotten rid of that	3 1 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6
uh bath two uh with three bedrooms	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 4 4
it it	6 6	3 1
that that supposed to be a real good statistic uh	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
cruise control and tinted windows	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
ive ive had ive ive known people who have had toyotas for years that have had almost no	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
dogs are real high maintenances	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared of	6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
and maybe not	6 6 6	6 6 6
the car now has a hundred and thirty something	3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre theyre theyre also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 2	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and i said that means that i ca ca work on it	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and they all lived down there by it	6 3 7 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i figured out a price based on that	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
of course you would	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
uh accept for the private ones of course	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
i i i i think i think there there a lot to be said for kids working	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 7	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
you know the	7 5 5	3 6 6
central and south america	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
laughter-through the years	6 2 4	6 6 6
and if i have to go take art classes you know im im not going to use them1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
where he was an actor trying to portray	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 4

and both people are working	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6

you know and	6 6 6	6 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
that stuff there is great for in road work	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
people off shore	2 4 4	6 6 6
provide military service to the country	6 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
theyll theyll say about it especially since	2 4 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 6
i im im	6 6 6	6 6 6
um in that	6 6 6	6 6 6
ccc ccc ccc during uh	2 4 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i kind of yeah ive ive heard things about that	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
from what i understanding here at ti ti they run	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6
i was going to say theyre theyre getting to the age where you can you can kind trust that a little bit	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
and this thing says that	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you know current news updates current weather	6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
it it	6 6	6 3
you know	6 6	6 6
it it it it seen some wear and tear	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
who knows	7 6	6 6
we we just built a real big	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre actually a necessity in life	2 4 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 4 6 4
theyve theyve gotten their butts kicked	3 1 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 2 4 4
but of course people are trapped economically	6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
never heard that one	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
itd itd be handy	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
so there there there there an established lawn and what	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
i do do i do do get into that too much	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the divine answer	7 5 5	6 6 6
each person would receive like forty thousand dollars	2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
my pleasure	2 4	6 6
i was hoping i could remember where all those other	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
laughter-mine laughter-too	2 6	6 6
when come time to get out of school	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4
we have plastic you know just tied down on everything you know as best we could	3 6 7 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 6 7 5 5 3 7	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4
and we also try and set aside money for savings	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 7	6 3 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
verbally or in writing	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
until the drug test came through	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4
so we went from	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6
that may be the	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
uh it seems like there there so much that goes to things that do do really do a whole lot of good	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
and somebody said	6 7 6	6 6 6
but when theyre theyre three years old theyre theyre	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
what the circumstances were	3 7 5 6	6 3 4 4
then they usually go	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and then quite often theyll theyll get shot because	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6
there is a a big difference in the uh economic	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
it it it it political maneuvering	6 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 1 6 6
they do	3 6	6 6
and i think for society for such a long time said	6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6
and yeah	6 6	6 6
is is it it a good idea	6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
that uh	3 2	6 6
they been trying these people now for twenty	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they were expecting an influx of	3 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 4
they do do understand what	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
we but we bought a van last year	6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
my mother would be happy at	3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
would you would you agree with that	6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that uh	6 6	6 6
but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
my brother had fish when i was a kid	2 4 6 2 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1
and some of the people in our church use birth control	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
like a big brother	7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
and one on the way	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
they want less government involvement in society	3 6 7 5 5 5 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
handed in	7 5	6 6
i mean it really was	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i actually yesterday i ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab im im in	6 6 2 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
laughter-he helps me out a lot	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
that that interesting	3 1 6	3 1 6
especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i wo wo have	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 3 6 4 4
again it it not typical in this area	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
they decided that that was enough camping for the weekend	3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
and so	6 6	6 6
now rifles are are too bad	6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
uh type of life	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4
i- i	6 3	6 6
i- i- i tell you	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and i do do know that it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
if i continue taking good care of it it it going to hold a pretty good resale value	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 3 4 6 4 4
if they do bring somebody on	7 3 7 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 4 4
in the	6 2	6 6
uh im im not sure what the future holds for that	6 3 1 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
you hope	3 6	6 6
the job	2 4	6 6
well i would like to have one that would bloom	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs layoffs	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4
well what do you think can be done about	6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
so now we have two parakeets	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
when they talk about the nightly gunfire	2 3 2 4 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
or to put in salads or to um	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
ive ive never seen any of those	3 1 6 6 7 2 3	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
uh reagan reagan	6 2 4	6 6 6
but i would like to see	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4
their prices to you know	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
uh theyre theyre	6 3 1	6 6 6
getting cocaine from his client	2 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
the republicans were more	3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6
you can you know you can get some of us	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3
i mean theyre theyre	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
one one bad enough	2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6
so youre youre you are are a sesame street fan	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 4 6 6
uh but that that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
see i do do have any	6 3 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6
states that either do do adopt	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
so youre youre probably uh	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it was the	3 6 6	3 6 6
theyre theyre messy	3 1 6	3 1 6
i i	6 6	6 6
my husband did too	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
not always	6 6	6 6
i mean someone in the process of rape	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
well any of the guys that were ground	6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
college freshman i college coed	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
uh i was hoping that you would	6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6
and the thing had uh	6 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
now with the voting and	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
did you sue him under the civil system	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and they have pets	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
or even even the um	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
figure out what they were talking about	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
but i have you know concerns	6 3 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 4
that that awful	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh it was a lot of fun you know	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
what part of the state do you live in	7 5 2 7 5 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
you uh have to learn	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and they were nearly all all diesel	6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
waterfront property here at love canal you know	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
but then it has like a kitchenette and things like that	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 7 2 4 3	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
so sure what kind of	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i mean school buses are notorious	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and he did a a pretty good job	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
you actually have students with with beepers	3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i even had to worry about	3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
but uh now they have what what called the world football league	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 4 6 6
they could could figure out what had happened	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
calculated down	6 6	6 6
id id forgotten what that that called	3 1 6 3 1 1 6	3 1 6 6 6 1 6
it it uh	6 6 6	3 1 6
oh always	6 6	6 6
not enough teachers	2 4 4	6 6 6
recently i was	6 3 6	6 6 6
when im im doing anything that im im in front of people or	6 3 1 6 3 2 3 1 2 7 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i feel is a is	3 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
having to the cost of new prisons	6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean it was really just sad	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know how many square feet it is a big circular driveway	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 3 1 6 4
you ca ca throw any of that away	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
because1 these little girls will never be the same	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
i remember the jurors uh	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
set up their schools	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 4
i- i	6 3	6 3
um i i live alone now	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
the superior	7 5	6 6
again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore miniskirts miniskirts	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
the oakland a a	3 1 1 1	3 6 6 6
so jobs have to i guess become more flexible	6 2 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
it seems like they come in spurts	6 6 6 3 6 6 7	6 6 6 2 4 2 4
would would pay them1	6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6
but they did did know for sure what it was	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
the one of which was uh	2 4 4 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 4
in regard that he did did design the patriot missile system	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized	6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
a lot to be made though	7 5 2 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 4 6
that uh	6 6	6 6
and i i do do know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
with you know paying	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
a police gun at one time	2 4 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
if i have a problem discipline you know i think now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
benefit from the same sorts of things	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
and they will be videos	6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 4
what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company-	7 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 6 4 3 4 6
we- weve noticed this in particular	3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
have those kind of target schools	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
well this	6 6	6 6
i mean if if youre youre talking about any if youre youre talking about something that that like a full time	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6
well thirty to forty minutes to get there from plano which is not bad at all	7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
fortunately the bills won	2 3 1 2	6 2 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you just memorize everything	3 6 6 3	6 6 4 6
uh a little of	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4
what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
orlando paper	2 4	6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
have lots of dinner parties	6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
that might be kind of tough huh	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 4 4 6
you know you you think well boy im im getting more money	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
the random drug testing	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
ah ah doing fine	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
some of the	7 2 4	6 6 3
i do do even remember how much money that theyve theyve	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
your health consciousness	2 4 4	6 6 6
that would be real good	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
but i took them out of my front yard	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
you know in in the minnesota area	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it uh it it only like eleven hundred square feet	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 4
they were just covered with them	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh it it because i-	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
i think he has some interesting things on it	3 6 2 6 7 5 5 6 3	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3
severe demeanor or something	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6
and it it it it really getting out of hantershand in	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6
uh to give you an example my mom had an elderly cat who uh	6 6 6 3 7 5 2 4 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6

if theyre theyre frozen	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and he knows	6 3 6	6 6 6
well i mean	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know i just feel like	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
almost an example of a	6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 3
they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats cats pans	3 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
weve weve seen that	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
completely polluted so that theyre theyre you know there there too many toxins and bacterial growth	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 4
top ten in terms of crime	2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
but yeah	6 6	6 6
i ca ca see all this little uh	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
it may have been massachusetts	6 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 4
they freak out when there there snow laughter-on laughter-the laughter-ground	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
some allergies	2 4	6 6

and uh	6 6	6 6
but then when it started i just could could	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
well i just got over the flu	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
some i know	6 3 6	6 6 6

to really help with the load in the house	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
laughter-i had had even thought about laughter-it	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and that that that that how a lot of people get into trouble	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 7	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 4 4
i uh	6 6	6 6
her first grader	2 4 4	6 6 6

i did did think that was any good	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
so that we could put in	2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
itll make the	6 6 6	6 6 6
here here one called ghost towns and mining camps of new mexico	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
it it amazing how much better i feel	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
none of this	3 2 3	6 6 6
theyre theyre not enforcing the death penalty itself	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6
and if	6 6	6 6
they asked him if he spanked his kids	3 6 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
you know i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
we finally sold his boa constrictor	3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
places where they uh	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
if they were going to save people people lives	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
kind of hard to do gradually	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6
i i was reading the other day about uh	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
the eight hundred number uh the customer service support line for a number of companies	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i guess the minute marks	3 6 3 1 1	3 6 6 6 6
and with	6 6	6 6
wonderful friends	7 5	6 6
i- i should should say innocent because i mean actually- actually if they commit a crime that theyre theyre in the same circumstances	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
his father was even the uh	2 4 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
jury system	3 1	6 6
because i mean crawfish	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
sons myself	2 6	6 6
well i i have never read anything of his	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
i have a gun	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
and as- as expensive as they are to produce they certainly do do want any dead airspace	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 4 4
i i think that does does really have that much to do with um	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well they do	6 3 6	6 6 6
so it it not really cure	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
i felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity	3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
but there is no place to	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
in fact my brother has a uh	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	3 6 2 4 6 6 6
uh that that may have been a	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that us too	3 1 2 6	3 1 6 6
and somebody was recommending it to somebody	6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and nobody had any idea what a liter was	6 3 6 7 5 3 2 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
when ive ive heard about england england elections they are allowed to run for what a total of six or eight weeks	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 4 6 4 4
we went to panama- he went to panama	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 3 4 6 6 2 4
i have no idea	3 6 7 5	6 3 6 6
and and it just drove me crazy	6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know uh they	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but they they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason	6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that	7 5 6 7 5 5 2 4 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
and that none of the ideas or thoughts are	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
is it small	6 3 6	6 6 6
well not me	6 6 3	6 6 6
recycling drive	2 4	6 6
really to me they they	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 1
there are no cubicles	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman	2 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
i thought for sure	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and it it just amazing	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
the house- you know housing there is extremely affordable	2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
about if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns then	6 6 3 6 2 7 5 6 6 2 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
it it easy i guess it it still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
on the other hand	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and and to me i mean you take away a person person freedom youve youve taken away most of their life	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
if you know if they want to get a	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
are you one of these uh	6 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 1 6
well northern virginia	6 6 6	6 6 6
listed off every single one of the perks	6 6 7 5 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
any anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me	6 6 7 5 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
you bring	3 6	6 6
i know a lot of wives feel	3 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
some bread crumbs um an egg	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 4
but then that kind of	6 6 2 4 7	6 6 6 6 6
but central canada tends to referred more to ontario and quebec	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4
i ive ive never been on a jury	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
so then they can call	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
hopefully theyll theyll do something	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4
and i just i heard a piece	6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they call it the um amish bread here	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 4 4 6
and it it got a lumbar support in the seats	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
but i think that it would would really be	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
in high school	6 2 4	6 6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
it was	6 6	6 6
that way	2 4	6 6
i think-	6 6	6 6
the the person we found it through the	6 3 1 1 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i- i	6 6	6 6
i do do know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i i	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 3
there there is there is it it an overall problem in in in this country understanding	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
what do you have	7 6 3 6	6 3 6 6
i guess that that it	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
well that that a nice way of putting it	6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
i do believe it it a serious problem	3 6 6 3 1 1 1 1	3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
this is strange	3 6 6	6 6 6
we bought it there	2 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
the drug culture	2 4 4	6 6 6
oh it was was	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
he knows he has to	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and maybe	6 6	6 6
and he he said he did did think it should of gotten all those awards	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well im im im im glad im im not the one that that	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
some of them1 are pretty rough	7 2 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
but it insists on full sun	6 3 6 6 7 5	6 3 4 4 4 4
were were we we fight that battle every day here at work	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 7 5 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
and i was i was the youngest	6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
the friend of ours over here he he got uh sixty	7 5 2 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
well i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
his parents are austrian	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
they can trace us down	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and wall hangings	2 4 4	6 6 6
well well damn right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and some of them fizzled out	6 7 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
you really have to watch it this you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know or anything like that	6 7 5 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
it seem like that that	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
up to that point i had never- i had always said i would never have one because1 i would would pay that kind of money for their name	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
does uh	6 3	6 6
dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the	2 7 5 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 7 6 7	6 3 6 3 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
i kind of gave up on them	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
nine yards	7 5	6 6
what did did did steinbrenner actually make money on the	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
i guess	3 2	6 6
well when i bought my car it was right out of college	6 6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 2 4
i did a sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the old testament and the new testament where where there there a vengeful lord in the old testament and there there a loving lord in the new testament	3 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 1	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 3 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
i do do know if i have even heard of that one	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6
i i do do use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 2 4 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 6
that that how they obtain information about segments of society	3 1 6 3 6 2 4 7 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
somebody said you have to be drug tested	3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and now has no two car garage and has uh	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6
day care situation for a few hours in the uh week	2 4 4 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
im im a big baseball fan	3 1 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 1 6 6
ca ca pay for it	6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling	3 6 2 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4
saying somebody somebody wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts- too shorts too short	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
so i i opted not for that but	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
course it does does always work out in their favor	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i guess i just push something here	3 6 3 6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and so when im im teaching a class obviously i wear a suit or dress	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
anything like	3 2	6 6
i just im im just totally	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
so many people were opposed to the war	2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
but it it it mostly relaxing	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
oh oh	6 6	6 6
at least in urban california	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4
uh a strange case that uh	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 2 4 4 4 4
you know senators senators sons and all that stuff too	6 3 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are	6 3 6 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6
the thing	6 6	6 6
and that that is a little troublesome	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
there there	6 6	3 1
we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer	3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
or pants	2 4	6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
the average classes really	3 1 1 6	6 6 4 6
you know he he tried to appeal his conviction	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
for cats anyway you know	6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but we are progressing	6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4
and i mean he he he just	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 1 6
like i said i really enjoy it when i do	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
and uh and i find even even at home here now i- i will wear blue jeans or ill ill wear shorts	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 6 1 6 4
entitled to a trial by jury	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 4
there were the opium dens	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
diesels do do require mechanics	2 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6
and there was humor involved	6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh and we take the the uh	6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 6 3
oh i	6 3	6 6
plea bargaining is something completely different	3 1 6 3 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
you know the masses	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
that that neat	3 1 6	3 1 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6
i ca ca remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it in the north end of oak cliff in uh kessler park area	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
with what they are with what the subject matter is	7 3 1 7 5 3 2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i have the time	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
if if somebody does observe you	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 4 6
but i just i kind of worry about getting a car that that that new	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
with yarn	6 2	6 6
you know he	6 6 6	6 6 6
then they sell	6 3 6	6 6 6
but that that that that probably because	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
ive ive never been	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
but i wonder if there are are some sociology courses	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
that could be done in an hour or two	3 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
personality conflict you just you worked with it	7 5 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
the older of two was	2 4 4 7 2	6 6 2 4 4
ten and twenty it it not too bad	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean it just dried up	6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
you know as far as how were were getting	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
you know having learning disabled- learning slow slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
they had to be	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it- it- it	6 6 6	6 6 6
to be cared for for the rest of their lives	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
but um i think that	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
one is eight	2 6 7	6 6 6
im im in plano	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
he he he he looking now to get rid of his	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know oh that was really great	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
my mother and i were uh	3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4

i always try to read the sunday paper	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
here it it uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job	6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
but ive ive never done it	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
it you are trying to avoid paying taxes	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
theyre theyre theyre theyre all over the country now	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 2 4 4
i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home	3 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
theyll theyll serve theyll theyll serve a quarter of it	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 3
and uh	6 6	6 6
and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers	6 3 6 6 7 3 7 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
and a lot of the kids did of course	6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
corpus christi texas which has the	2 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh wow	6 6	6 6
in the persian gulf war	6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh nickie	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
sometimes um usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news	6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 2 7 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
near enough as as much as you	2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
with a lot of these kids	6 7 5 2 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6
not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
is the uh	6 2 4	6 6 6
making you	7 3	6 6
of course when the place in arlington	6 6 6 3 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 4 6 4
some of these people are just out and out brutal	7 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
how nice	6 6	6 6
so we went over there	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and theyre theyre like one of the best teams in spring training so far	6 3 1 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 6
to a to another kind of to another type of listener	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
this this came-	6 3 6	6 6 6
that that the problem	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
he did did want them	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
and you	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i you see it in	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and she worked really hard to get good people	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
were were becoming a service country	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 4
the criminals that are going to get their guns	7 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
um youre youre not supposed to i mean youre youre not supposed to eat them1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
but uh no	6 6 6	6 6 6
no kidding	6 6	6 6
and so uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
not by much	6 6 7	6 6 6
i think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the the person contact rather than just	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
in that van	6 3 1	6 6 6
it it it it kind of funny	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 2 4
so my next trip is going to be to texas	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and we can put full size cards in there	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
that would call	3 2 4	6 6 6
of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them theyre theyre expensive too	6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 3 3 1 6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
what do you believe in	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
itd itd probably be	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
i do do know why	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
so so i guess our population has grown some too	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6
but ibm ibm ibm is what im im looking at right now	6 3 1 1 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
and so	6 6	6 6
id id find it hard to levy that against somebody	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
because um	6 6	6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
there is been a lot of speculative building	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
smaller scales	7 5	6 6
elderly couples once their kids have left that can	7 5 6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
he he got to go to a lot of trouble	3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well the first uh uh the first time i turned it on	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3 2	6 3 4 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4
this must be a a hard category	3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the prison system are just you know	3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
and and that that been done	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
he put up all of his ash trays	3 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and i enjoyed my guns	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
now with the many programs throughout the country on how to resist taking drugs	6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
we do do have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 7 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
so he was caught	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre	3 1	3 1
so i get um	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i have to be real careful about	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and you refer them to the nurse	6 3 6 2 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
ive ive never heard of that	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it like they remain	6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
so laughter-it cost her three hundred dollars	6 3 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know you get a paper every day	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4
it it was pretty early in the year	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the resolution between	2 4 4	6 6 6
or in the garage or whatever	7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4
and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6
they use joe blow blow social- uh social security number	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
so im im kind of	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i think was the last time i was up up there and at center park	3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1	3 6 6 2 4 6 3 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
my first comments on the budget	3 1 1 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 2 4
a lot of those those in the	7 5 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4
he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there	3 6 6 7 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
weve weve gotten into a very litigious	3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
correcting papers and and i	2 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
to uh that they are testing with	2 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
because of the problems in the schools	6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 2 4
if they would just quit blowing it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6
and uh i just same sort of thing	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
aluminum can smashers	7 5 5	6 6 6
only problem with our schnauzer she she an indoor dog	2 4 6 3 1 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 3 6 2 4 4
chevy van	2 4	6 6
steak laughter-places	2 4	6 6
some things	2 4	6 6
that that uh can stifle creativity	3 1 6 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 4 4
i always told my wife i said you know	3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well and also to make it economically feasible	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
we did it in the fall	3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6
it does does	3 6 6	6 6 6
and so and then you call this number	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well im im from new mexico	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 4
so theyre theyre really not full	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
not for a long time anyway	6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
it really	3 6	6 6
but there was no	6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6
i do do i do do think there there anything wrong with that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
right now are political suicide	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 4
but i would would i would would say that i i completely like heavy metal	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
that that kind of a let down	2 4 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan	2 4 4 3 2 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
in fact ive ive heard of studies that suggest that that is is	6 6 3 1 6 6 7 3 7 5 3 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 4
i had stuff for like sanger harris	3 6 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
it it really strange	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
or you can you can	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
it it just been at at three years	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
of course	6 6	3 6
i mean dallas is a very marked up	6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
course your court system	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4
they they	6 6	6 6
and she she	6 2 4	6 6 6
did did bother me	6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
is it any of your business	6 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
threat to life and limb	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
um you know it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
they could could hurt me with their ten key or something	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
something that that called uh an economic	3 1 1 7 5 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
problem yet	2 6	6 6
not you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
you pull it and take it out and throw it away	3 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and you can probably spend	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
i think that they do do use electronic-	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
they made a position for them1 some where	3 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
coarse kind of test	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and and all he has to do is hit the ball	6 6 7 3 7 5 5 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
so we may just be	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well what kind of blue	6 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6
i hate-	6 6	6 6
force two people to work even though it it higher productivity is short-term	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4
uh really a a rationalize that while i was sitting there	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i mean because the the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
itd itd be easy to take it all	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 7	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
and it it like	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
all right	6 6	6 6
western- a bank western financial	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
that goes into welfare each year	3 1 1 1 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
and- i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
and then even like uh what is it eric dickerson	6 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
theyre theyre a lot more strict	3 1 7 5 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
but but	6 6	6 6
but other states you have to register every couple of years and uh	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
uh griedousgrievous acts are done to uh to you know	2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6
gosh what do you call it fish tank	2 7 2 3 2 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
maybe maybe	3 1	3 1
uh she she uh	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
and they theyve theyve started some	6 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6
if youre youre a felon it is taken away from you	6 3 1 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3
the demand is so high that uh you know they were going to retail them around like third you know	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
i wish if	3 6 6	6 6 6
pieces that have that	2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6
we have um	3 6 6	6 6 6
i find	3 6	6 6
are are uh	2 4 4	6 6 3
but it it not as it it not like uh chicago where it it got that much instrument to it	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6
was it was quite unusual to see the people in that town	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
but they they really need pruning	6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
there was a high error rate	6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 6
well you might wanna wanna get yourself uh an animal that does does require much attention like a cat	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
perhaps the automotive industry is improving	6 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 4 6 2 4
like you said the divorce rate is getting so high	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
we lost lives	3 6 2	6 6 6
you know took a couple	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6
well id id bought uh a gmc gmc gmc	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and there there the history of yoakum county texas there	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4
you might	3 6	6 6
if their plans do do work you know	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i think those old cars	3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4
ideally you know you need money to do everything	6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
it it like day and night	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
theyd theyd be able to say im im sorry	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
tremendous amount	7 5	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
well i guess it depends on who you talk to	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6
in what way	6 7 5	6 6 6
most everybody seems pretty well employed	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
parts to it	2 4 3	6 6 6
let let let let make them pay as much as possible	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
oh im im sure	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and it it not refuted people	6 3 1 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6
so this is like the first thing that that written down	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6
so you think that would be a deterrent	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4
they can watch	3 6 6	6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
if you do not pick the trash up	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
i like i like them every now and then for a change	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but you were working downtown	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
out on a limb here	6 6 7 5 6	6 6 3 6 6
i do think that in the middle east war	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
lots of shading	7 2 4	6 6 6
it it real nice	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and i heard all these these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 6
in johnson city tennessee	6 2 4 4	6 6 4 6
they they claimed they did the best that they could	6 3 6 3 6 7 5 3 1 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
we were were home	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and people do do want to believe that	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i was really	6 6 6	6 6 6
i do do want to think about buying a car for a while	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
do you remember that that song	6 3 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
look at the cowboys now	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6
i i agree	6 3 6	6 6 6
theyve theyve got a	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
well i think it does	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
extraordinarily trite	6 6	6 6
getaway type thing	7 5 5	6 6 6
ones that we were test driving were the uh	2 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and and especially some of the minority children whether you know a racist or not	7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and it seems to me that it it it it not a totally bad idea	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
i do do know if it it still	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6
but i think that- i think it needs to be expedited	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
im im from the north	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
the ones at the grocery store half the time theyve theyve pulled the lid off	3 1 6 3 1 1 7 5 5 3 1 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 4
what did i say peter	7 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 4
that that	6 3	6 6
well she can type about one	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3
proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
and if it it not	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
while while there are some advantages to that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
somebody somebody	3 1	3 1
well that that not	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
so um	6 6	6 6
it it like	6 6 6	3 1 6
they just	3 6	6 6
i missed that question totally i mean really bad	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
i do do know what we got for all the money	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
if someone someone	6 3 1	6 6 6
mow the laughter-grass and	6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6
i think i i have to try that	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it it it nice	6 6 3 1 6	3 1 3 1 6
they do it by lethal injection at huntsville	3 6 3 6 2 4 6 2	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 4
i did did much care for the first one	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and that they may have been forced	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
um in san antonio i do do know what the answer is	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
essentially the first thing is that- is on the order of you	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 3
i mean you got to wonder how long theyre theyre going to keep doing that for	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
we care less	3 6 6	6 6 6
next year	2 4	6 6
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
i heard it on the news today	3 6 3 6 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 6
you had to register as a gun owner	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
and it	6 6	6 6
were were supposed to put all our week week garbage into it	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 4 6
a deal to go ahead and let us uh	7 5 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know a part of the individual themselves	6 2 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
there there quite a little jump there	6 6 2 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6
i do do even know if there there any other shows that i watch real	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and another thing that that real good about um	6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
you know i would love to to be able to read more because i i enjoy it so much	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
but you get you know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
a kid	2 4	6 6
a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are	7 5 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 7 3 7	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4
the racial differences i mean just you we are so close to the border with mexico	7 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
the great	6 6	6 6
different flower beds in front and uh a window box a built in window box um	2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
im im used to pieces	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6
pr pr campaign in each community each county	7 5 5 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
but uh last year i bought a honda accord	6 6 2 4 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
so you know that that so	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
when does it	6 6 6	6 6 3
a temp at texas instruments	7 5 5 2 4	3 6 6 4 4
denies you	6 6	6 6
we had a house and a home and	3 6 7 5 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6
there there some	6 6 2	3 1 6
mom left to go get a job and dad did did move in to fill the gap	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4
oh my word	6 6 6	6 6 6
but uh i i myself am in favor of it	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
he he my ex-husband	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
well i think they got the new z	6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
and- and i understand theyre theyre doing it because the prisons are full	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize it it everybody everybody responsibility	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 4 4
so you- she knows she does wrong	6 6 3 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 2 4 4
produce some new programs anyway	6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 4 4
just hang up	6 6 6	6 6 6
laying out can be	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6
that use to be i think a couple of years ago	3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
and they could could find it anyplace	6 2 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i mean absolutely	6 6 6	3 6 6
and that aggravates me	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
um ive ive ive ive probably	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
theyve theyve got research triangle park here	3 1 6 7 5 5 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
which is why im im going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
if they go back to the inner city they may not see trees for a while much less	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 7 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
it was you know i was just one of those	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know im im	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i i did did do that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
the police do do catch them	2 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
in between people	2 4 4	6 6 6
and uh even though it was older	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and i guess to curb	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
firing tom landry and hiring jimmy johnson	6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and uh that sort of	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that i that i will give credit to to our our company for in that	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
maybe wear longer sleeve shirts	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
what what about	6 7 6	6 6 6
be most persuadable by their arguments you know	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but they really did	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
not sure id id look forward to making that kind of decision about a man man life	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 4 4 4
they classify most of them1 as professionals	3 6 7 2 3 6 2	6 6 6 3 3 1 6
oh i do	6 3 6	6 6 6
clothing and gas and	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
in same school with you know uh i guess ten year olds	6 2 4 4 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
that that what we do too	2 4 3 2 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
they sell their house	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
you know in one	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
that make sense	3 6 6	6 6 6
let let hear about it group of	6 6 2 4 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
you ca ca see any prisoners	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
but kentucky kentucky beautiful	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
the creeks and stuff in the area	2 4 4 4 4 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
like where i work it it it it pretty casual um	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6 4 4
you know if uh	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
ones do you get into	2 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and the next day they	6 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6
cd-rom cd-rom cd-rom	7 5 5	3 6 6
and it even shows the states that	6 2 6 6 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6
you know when- when you consider	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
soon after i had done that once	6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre not selling them1	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
you did did get any government classes	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
he just works a normal job	3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 6
seems like	6 6	6 6
people just had a picture of carter as not being real capable	2 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
um more or less	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair you know going oh no no	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
as long as you can still buy a product in the english	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4
if a parent has proved to be unfit	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 6 2 4 4
the training	2 4	6 6
because now every time we plan anything just about we write to the chamber of commerce of where were were going because	6 6 2 4 3 2 3 2 4 3 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 4 4
it it just uh too much	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
uh after that	2 4 3	6 6 6
potential out of the person	7 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
course i do do ever get around to reading them	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do believe that	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
they will	3 6	6 6
i mean theyve theyve made a substantial amount of money from it	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
i hate to tell the senator-	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
ive ive never seen that	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
i did did want it	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
walking is kind of boring	2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i i wanted to see	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
some kids are really having it	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers	6 3 6 3 1 1 2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
well um i do do have	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6

i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and uh rural school systems are like i- i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 2 4 4
the whole	2 4	6 6
well you-	6 6	6 6
weve weve uh	3 1 6	3 1 6
circuit city	7 5	6 6
that i figured	6 3 6	6 6 6
course this country is is a dictatorship	6 3 1 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 2 4
im im im im noticing that too	6 6 3 1 6 2 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6
on my car	2 3 1	6 6 6

i do do know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 4

really good piece of work	2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
summers here too right	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
to commute to work	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
but she said you know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 3
the various- on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not	2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6
you know what uh	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4
not for me	6 6 3	6 6 6
id probably agree with that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing	6 7 5 2 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
you know really	6 2 7	6 6 6

i think they only uh found him guilty on one count	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
it it just so sad you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
i do do know what laughter-foley laughter-foley laughter-is	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 1 6
but i think plano is	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
that make sense	3 6 6	6 6 6
for different people for you know other places	6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 2 4 4

global market place these days	7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6

accumulate your sick leave	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4

and so i travel a lot	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
it just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
i- i like to go on the nights when there there not anybody out there not very many people out there	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
the motivational factor is probably	3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and your defense attorney presents their evidence	6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
get some general business courses in high school	6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
and never thought about it	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
well ive ive enjoyed talking to you	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 6 4
the shock of being spanked with the actions they did	2 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 3 2	3 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 6
the only thing i guess-	2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6
the cops are gonna gonna come to you	7 5 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and uh a big percentage of that was used up	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6
and i- i can do a pretty good pie	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 4
and california for the most part	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
how you talk to them	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i was fortunate	3 6 6	6 6 6
and they do not have any	6 3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 4
to come in and live with them1	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
bless your heart	6 2 4	6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i was	6 6	6 6
or fuel injected	6 6 6	6 6 6
in other words youre youre saying that we you have to find out whether it it premeditated or	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
by this um	2 3 2	6 6 6
you know and theyre theyre being paid probably half what most people being paid	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 3 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
the players and stuff they finally quit giving away	2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category	6 3 6 2 7 2 7 2 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
my uh i had four brothers	6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
on the gold card	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
and i i think they said the reds um	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
kind of a push to	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
i just	6 6	6 6
and to get the your your phone number on uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
he ended up with about three sets of tools	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
i mean just the you know the cost of living	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and then do you know that number	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 6
they do do	6 6 6	6 6 6
excuse me	6 3	6 6
and i find ways	6 3 6 7	6 6 6 6
and it it it it the house is forty years old	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
because1 the place where you buy your car	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
baseball is there is there life up there like football is down here i think	2 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4
and i guess refrigerators are the same way	6 3 6 7 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 2 4 6
and uh the united states said well thatd mean we get to bring in forty	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and that	6 3	6 6
like you said if you had four kids	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
his his	3 1	3 1
plus if something goes wrong ill know who to blame	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i- i just ca ca imagine	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
well it it a big tourist town	6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
telling that they do do know how to read	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
well you got to get one of those ladders	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
two and a half years ago now	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
because i thought lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
like youre youre judging us	7 3 1 7 3	6 3 1 6 6
lubbock at the time	2 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
going after the drug dealers	7 5 3 1 1	6 6 3 6 6
i do do know about rural california too well	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and i just	6 3 6	6 6 6
i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere id id never make it	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6
i think it it the bartman bartman	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
well that that good	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and they all went through it	6 3 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
ive ive	6 6	3 1
well the the uh the the people that	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so i own a home in pensacola	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
inspect it	6 3	6 3
not- nobody does	6 3 6	6 6 6
get your heating and cooling cycles to work	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 4
tested for honeywell	6 6 3	6 6 6
and ive work in a situation like that	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i guess if	3 6 6	6 6 6
it tasted pretty good really	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
do do you know in virginia whether it it if they have smaller juries	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
before we	6 3	6 6
well they converted all the road signs to fifty miles an hour you know	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6
it it good to	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
but they won	6 3 6	6 6 6
so uh i bought the alternator	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
lots of	7 5	6 6
there there there no way	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
there there so much more now	6 6 7 5 5 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
but i think we get excellent local coverage	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and then you throw in	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
but i like your idea of education	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
i was planting some broccoli and and some of those	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6
and i was dead set against it	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
uh im im against it	6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together	3 6 6 3 7 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
is to	6 6	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
everything i learned about ancient rome has- has not helped me anywhere in my adult life	3 1 2 4 7 5 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 3
if theyre theyre getting away with it can you imagine	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with	7 5 5 5 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
in nineteen eighty	2 4 4	6 6 6
and an appropriate punishment and have that	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 4 4 4 6 6
you know there is like say assault or some such i think there ought to be a unanimous uh vote because	3 2 6 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
but there is is any um	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6
it it kind like this uh box shape	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
the ghettos	7 5	3 6
and it it depends on what it is you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and i- i work on a uh landscape committee for our neighborhood	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
because nobody in our company got a raise	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 4 6 2 4
split stuff off	6 2 6	6 6 6
but the difference	6 2 4	6 6 6
if bigger companies do	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
im im gonna gonna have lots of dinner parties	3 1 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 4

were were supposed- i guess were were supposed to wait	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
how to handle cold weather	6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6

out of debt	6 6 3	6 6 6

and there there no way that that can be done	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
to a point to a point the bottom you know the early parts of it youre youre giving the foundations of the nation	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 1 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4
life in there that that	2 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6
so we went back in	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
than some people less than others	6 2 4 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6

and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i do too	3 6 6	6 6 6
how interesting	6 6	6 6
what what what what your feeling about	6 6 7 5 2 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 4
checked out or whatever	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it it it tricky because1 i know you know an awful lot of intelligent people who just well im im too busy to serve on a jury	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
is that is that um pretty predominant as far as california do do	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3
and that that the where	6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i hear of one every now and then	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i never realized i really did did realize how much stuff i actually throw away	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
but i bought it i bought it used	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
and it was sort of exciting	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4
i think it it seven hundred fifty five families	3 7 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
trivial- almost trivial with it	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
but i mean i i do do know what what how they do the flour	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then again it takes too long for it to work	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
that was absurd	3 6 6	6 6 6
plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it it just it just gets out of hand	2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
do you know my grandparents live in durant	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
im im im im sure there there a lot of um	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
of companies	2 4	6 6
and i do do think uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
that they deserve	3 1 7	6 6 6
i find too that i have more energy when i exercise	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
and they ca ca imagine why we would want to have children	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not youre youre feeling threatened as a result of of it	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
but anyway it is interesting	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
and we should should be fighting a war	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
require everyone to	6 3 6	6 6 6
that that what ive ive heard	3 1 1 1 1 6	3 1 6 3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know it it hard sometimes	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
whatever theyre theyre taking at the time	3 1 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
might have been better	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and then the power went off again	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
and i really think they really do a wonderful job	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
now everybody everybody available	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
it was just one day a week	6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
im im not real familiar with that	3 1 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
well she just plants a few for herself	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4
but uh i mean they they just moved into the new building	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 2 4 4
that- that exist in the in the criminal system today	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but at the same time it it really not	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6
i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6
that that probably very true	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and i looked at my husband	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
two that i	7 2 4	6 6 6
well the	6 2	6 6
and cars and all their books	6 7 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
i just would would	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
they forgot	2 6	6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
so that that what ive ive taken to doing lately	6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
we just finished watching uh teenage mutant ninja turtles on tape you know	2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
it would would be convenient	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
you know they can get a they can grasp the points	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and i saw there were some stop signs i mean submerged up to the writing	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
if if you ca ca	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6
and and i think it was there in florida	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
city workers	2 4	6 6
we have have had much luck with it	3 6 6 6 7 5 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3
uh i guess my i the one my one bad thing is that i am that i wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because i think she would have really	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
uh i think they enjoy that	6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 6
all up and down the coast	2 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 2 4
not a man not a repair man but just a friend	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
these big old flame worn suburbans	3 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 4 4 4

the morale among employees tends to go down	7 5 5 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean theyve theyve never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4

his answer was oh i gave him permission to to miss	2 4 6 6 3 6 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
like a looks like a sitting area type you know like a two room type tent	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4

well a lot of it can be contributed to the	6 7 5 2 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
a shotgun shotgun got too much of a spread	2 4 4 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then we could talk a bit about um	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 2 4 6

when you listen to it it it um	6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
executed for	6 6	6 6
two piece	2 4	6 6
we really have	3 6 6	6 6 6
is that the one set in the fifties or sixties	6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
we traded his pistol for that shotgun	3 6 2 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
luckily someone came by and gave me a ride	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
i mean i i have a i am originally from pittsburgh pennsylvania	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 4 6 4 4
but what they	6 6 6	6 6 6
that sounds rather crass i think because then then youre youre saying well	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
my dad was a very traditional dad	2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i guess- i guess to answer the question directly im im still just a	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6
texas being a uh rebel state	2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
i think they are	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
and i	6 3	6 6
and it it it it just hysterical	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
that that the best way to shop	3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets	7 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
good talking to you too don	6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
but i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
something like that	3 2 3	6 6 6
convinced that maybe things like	6 6 6 2 7	6 6 6 6 6
places to	2 4	6 6
so it it the same age bracket	6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 3 1 6 6 4 4
thirty and thirty	3 6 2	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
we have lean-to up here	3 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you do do want to get off the beaten track	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
college is so casual	2 6 6 6	6 6 2 4
well if you if you liked beetlejuice youll youll probably like edward scissorhands	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 4
if i was in a public restaurant	6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
and the smell is really bad they say	6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
any that they do do promise anything specific these days	6 6 2 6 6 6 3 2 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
anyway- at least they theyll theyll have a hard time crawling up the thing	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean theyre theyre manipulated by their children	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 1 6 6 2 4
that that one of the things i do do do do understand is is so much of the controversy	3 1 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 2 4 3 6 4 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6
i liked rainman too	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
and it you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in central park a couple of years ago	7 2 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
thursday- thursday	2 4	6 6
oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4
i im not a criminal justice specialist	6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean theyre theyre going to	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
they came in	3 6 6	6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
burglar alarms	2 4	6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
there are times when people	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
so she had to go	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6
oh the university-	6 6 7	6 6 6
six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
it it uh	3 1 6	3 1 6
i wonder where	3 6 6	3 6 6
i- i do do remember how many people	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and and i think that that good because	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
but we	6 6	6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
you know theyre theyre not original	6 2 3 1 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
what is perceived to be that part of town and	3 7 5 5 5 3 1 1 1 7	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
probably so	6 6	6 6
that same house here would probably cost three	2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
they go around in their little coaching shorts or	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
i think they would socialize easier	3 6 2 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 4
but those who do do have money can go in and get the same care	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it it amazing we also have roses	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and i guess i just	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
we really only know of one um	3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year	3 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6
where where the money supposed to come from	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6
uh for mental duress or whatever	2 4 7 5 2 6	6 6 4 6 6 4
isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you go in their bathroom	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
and all of a sudden he becomes a hero	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
recycling campaigns that	2 4 3	6 6 6
uh even so there were	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
made me pull her back out	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4
anyway it it itll be	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
it did happen in that manner before television	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
well how do you get the edge though	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
tell me about your computer laurie	6 3 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 4 4
if nothing else	6 3 2	6 6 6
that is uh been the worse thing that weve weve seen happening	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
if we paid them more	6 3 6 3 2	6 3 6 6 6
eyes are the same color and everything	2 6 2 4 4 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean im im sure you heard about some of ours	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
and uh i guess it is	6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
there there nothing wrong with that	6 6 3 2 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
um let let see	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well he was in he was in the same center for two years for the first two years	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
so ive ive gone up to indianapolis on occasion to visit friends	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 2 4 4
and i	6 3	6 6
well the same thing	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
and i just said to this kid	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
a suburb near a suburb called plano	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i think she was a psych major	3 6 3 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 2 4 4
it really- really does does	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
uh weve weve got plenty	6 3 1 6 7	6 3 1 6 6
and it you know that that	6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 6
do you have any children	6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4
the whole way	2 4 4	6 6 6
i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i think there there still	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
you go through the the general battery of	3 2 4 4 7 5 5 2	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i do do	6 6 6	6 6 6
other day they do your normal trash	7 5 3 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do feel like the kgb kgb kgb is monitoring my phone or anything like that	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 3 2 3	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and czechoslovakia	7 5	6 6
uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
but then	6 6	6 6
uh i think that uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
theyre theyre entitled to a speedy trial	3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
boston massachusetts	3 2	3 1
amount of violent right in the state	7 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
it sounded you were calling from around the world laughter-somewhere	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
and they	6 3	6 6
what did you think of the news coverage of the war	7 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
it it it it really scary	6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6
uh predisposition	7 5	6 6
that that personal- that that personal air laughter-pollution	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
you know all of these things	6 6 7 2 4 4	3 6 6 2 4 4
i know	6 6	6 6
had her at a private sitter for	6 3 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
if you had a choice of your car what would you get	6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4 7 6 3 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
i guess we always focus on criminal trials with with the jury	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
and and it it it it	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 4
and the corruption of politics in in in that situation	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
he needs some more	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
because i work now	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
they just	6 6	6 6
we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks	3 6 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6
but that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
uh participating in any type crime	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
different than what you have down there	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i see where	3 6 6	6 6 6
you know hed hed	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
but it it that that just what it is	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 1 6 6 6 6
not anymore	6 6	6 6
and that way you know you do do get	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and so we said great you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i ca ca seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
and then it then it it just a a bush there from then on	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
beer and and	2 4 4	6 6 6
and uh she she been holding herself pretty well	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
totally unfeeling	6 6	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and then you get one exam for the whole semester	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up	6 3 6 3 6 3 7 5 5 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
or sixteen- fifteen	6 6 2	6 6 6
theyre theyre coming from	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
discrimination or or	7 5 5	6 6 6
i like music that is that i feel	3 6 3 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
let me ask you the question	6 3 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
well that that nice	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
is is it amazing that somebody can write that many laughter-books laughter-about	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
people are just	2 6 6	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
and um	6 6	6 6
there may be bottles as well	6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
or did you have hotel rooms	6 6 3 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 4 6
theyre theyre hurting	3 1 6	3 1 6
and that would be it	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh his uh social security number driver driver license any kind of records he may have	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay	6 7 5 5 5 3 7 3 7 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
you can pick it up anyplace anyplace	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 4
it is	3 6	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
who um	3 2	6 6
and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
but uh	6 6	6 6
and it looks pretty good out there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i saw the the uh	3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6
well i think	6 6 6	6 6 6
i believe it it gone up to a dollar now	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do want to call her a baby she she does does laughter-like laughter-to laughter-be laughter-called laughter-that	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
that speaks well of your mother	3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
we could only cover two at that	2 6 6 6 2 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
so ill ill tell them that	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
there could be some sort of problem	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
and you can just stop by	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
but i guess they were talking about experiences	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
they do do like it then they should not be employed there	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
the russian soldiers	7 5 5	6 6 6

that that the the smell is awful	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4

serious injury to another person then maybe that	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
and well well test you every three months thereafter while you work here	6 3 1 6 3 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
we started getting smart	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car	3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
so you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
i mean therere therere a lot of kids who when theyre theyre ten	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 3 1 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
top rated high school	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
pop or whatever	7 5 6	6 6 6
but he he not	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
i think think got six belts on the sucker	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4

oh well it it not that long ago	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it not going to be wholesale because of the cost	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
i kind of gotten into	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
this is how much i know about baseball	3 6 3 1 1 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
oh boy	6 6	6 6
i would i would rather have it that way	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know stealing the hundred dollar jackets	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
uh or maybe eventually	2 4 4 4	6 3 4 4
personally i would like to move out of a four bedroom house and	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
oh no	6 6	6 6
or they used	6 3 6	6 6 6
now uh were you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and somehow that broke off	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
course youre youre familiar with the ti ti drawing	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6
itd itd be well worth it if youre youre considering buying a car to find out	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
i see	3 6	6 6
and if youre youre trying to hold out you know there there so much pressure on you	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
i think theyre theyre out of town	3 6 2 4 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
that that where we met	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4
you know people that	6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6
six years	7 5	6 6
that that just going to terrify him	3 1 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
and they have them	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
starting kindergarten	6 3	6 6
you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty grand a year	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
but if you do do vote i sort of feel like	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and you pour it over rice	6 3 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 3 1 6
you know the old ones	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
there there there there been no emphasis on recycling at all in san antonio	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
and now	6 6	6 6
who whose whose supposed to make the change	6 7 5 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
so i do do think i do do think therell therell be too much problem	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
i would think that	3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6
real close	6 6	6 6
there are many	6 6 2	6 6 6
and he had left her home alone	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and what do you do with it	6 7 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so were were in the process of uh	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
i guess im i you know im im satisfied	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
that that was- that was just a matter of	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
which is gonna gonna take twenty years to resolve you know	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and they do do do very much vigorous exercise at all	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
oh no	6 6	6 6
a a potential	6 6 6	3 1 6
how can you even think like that	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
mainly school sports and things like that	6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
serious the problem is and how important it is to do that	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
it can go on for ten twenty years	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
theyre theyre so completely different culturally and socially and	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
first and foremost the bills	6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6
it it kind of embarrassing	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6
eligible- eligible for a fine	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter	7 2 3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
i mean it really does except for what we give to my	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and and well of course the you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6

i mean what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know	6 6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 4 4 6 6
there is value just in work for itself	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well the uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and some of them are are	6 7 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
put at risk	6 6 3	6 6 6
and and uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i	6 6	6 6
and they just laughed at me	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
and were they uh were they	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and i think that	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
you you can watch different news	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 4
his preference is um	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
and then how many	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean if you get	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i i did did i did did set the time or anything to uh	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
that occurred to me is	3 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
but the minute marks are done	6 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
i would think i if i did anything id id protect the juror from	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 2 4 4
good point	7 5	6 6
uh just it was	6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6
and i push them on swing	6 3 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
and the kids do do care	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 4 6
that that probably very useful	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
one out of every seven people moves laughter-every laughter-year	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 4 4 4 4 6
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 2 4
and it it not	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
i just remember seeing a uh kind of a synopsis of it	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6
in the first place	6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4

what do you think about nolan ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars	7 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4

and i just	6 3 6	6 6 6
well right now im im just a homemaker	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4

that that why theyre theyre there and not me	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
even with the death penalty in effect i do do think that uh	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 3 6 4 4 4 4
im im through	3 1 6	3 1 6

and every time they had a sale there i was	6 7 5 3 7 2 4 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i i feel like it should be mandatory in some	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of the	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6

well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process	6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4

my feelings were that we needed this bridge to	2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
i mean i guess that that fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and you just destroyed the mice	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
one point	2 4	6 6
who who from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that void	3 1 2 7 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 4 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 4 4
uh that almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 3
uh car pollution seems to be	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 4
of what what going on	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but i guess to get back to the main topic	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4
probably uh	7 5	6 6
and it it like you know that that a big problem	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
but you know it was a lot of fun too	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
be that as it may everybody	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4
you look at their society	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
you know after	6 2 4	6 6 6
one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
one one feeling obligated	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
you know that was one thing we noticed laughter-last week that	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
not a	2 4	6 6
and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
have you had that experience recently	6 3 6 7 5 6	6 3 6 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 3
what they were you know what they were looking for	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
i heard about that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
i think it it now is what uh from what i understand it it air conditioning units	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 4 4
but im im not sure i could afford three	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
everybody seems disappointed	3 6 6	6 6 6
i do do think i could stay home all the time and do nothing	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
certain types of folk styles	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
then um	6 6	6 6
part of the process also is that you must register preregister	7 2 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know it may take a half	6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it always easy to find an excuse not to exercise	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
i think it becomes a lot less	3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means theyre theyre young uh	2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 2 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 4
i- i- i mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh machinations to uh you know protect him from	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4
so he served out his his sentence	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so i got a uh book of his short stories	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4 6
you they know that theyre theyre not supposed to do it	6 2 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3
but you know for for what	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
you know news articles or whatever they had	6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and were were going to have to say if you commit this crime and if were were sure you commit this crime	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
and it just started	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
the law enforcement community	3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6
but then also there just is is the ability to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
and they do do	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
anyway so a this piece obviously um	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
blue or gray or black and a white shirt and you know no variation	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 7 5	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 4
it really is	6 6 6	6 6 6
and you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
what an inch and a half wide	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 3 1 6
they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well i- i- i think one of the big problems	6 6 6 3 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4
our winters have been absolutely nothing	2 4 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 4
not everybody has to have kids	2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 4
well but it	6 6 6	6 6 6
there there a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 6 7	6 6 6 3 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
i mean we	6 6 6	3 6 6
you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that	6 6 6 6 6 3 2 7 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
and then	6 6	6 6
that that good	3 1 6	3 1 6
there have been people who have	6 6 6 2 3 2	6 6 4 4 6 6
that that the last thing you want to do	3 1 7 5 5 3 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 6 3 6 6 4
well parents were getting really	6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
well no	6 6	6 6
when i was home with them and it it was just so much cooking	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
im im not trying to see the government put out any more	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
and then they uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
just as far as being a	6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 3
you know	6 6	6 6
that that probably like	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
it was very slim	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
and it it it it it really scary	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
im im not even	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
their voice is heard	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i do do see any problem at all having them1 go out there and and	3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
and it it certainly and it it certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4	6 3 1 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
i think that that the way it it worded	3 6 3 1 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
you know	6 6	6 6
is that a big thick book	6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 4
i mean theyd theyd rather- much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 4
that that the way it was	3 1 2 4 3 2	3 6 3 1 6 6
lightning or something knocked it out	7 5 5 6 3 6	6 3 4 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
harrison ford	2 4	6 6
i know how that goes	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and it came down	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
like i bought i bought the most	6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
if id id of probably had three or four children	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
oh great	6 6	6 6
it was	6 6	6 6
now to me that that kind of a drawback	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
that was so simple	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that we see	3 1 7	6 6 6
but i believe that there there definitely a basic perception and image problem	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
um there there been some progressive medical schools out here	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
shopping is no fun anymore	2 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 4 4
and um you know i i know that when i you know when i get his book im im im im usually going to enjoy it	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 2 4 6
i would would want to bring a cat into a full grown dog	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
they do a lot of research	3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 4
really remember what else	6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6
well im im not blessed	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
plus he cleaned up my mess	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
and taxes get raised	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that fine	3 1 6	3 1 6
there are certainly parts of town	6 6 6 7 2 3	6 3 4 6 6 4
oh wow	6 6	6 6
like good grief	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it and it it i think it it kind of a new movement	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 4 6
that that what that that what happened when i when i first uh	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
where there there uh endangerment to their own life and other people people lives	2 6 6 2 7 5 2 4 4 7 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
but youve youve got five kids you know	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
you better have your designated driver	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
basically says they do do want to do it	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
you know go in and get one	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the um	6 6	6 6
and uh an part of the the movie is where he he trying to clean this dog up	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6
rather ominous about having	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
i mean like if	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
im im sure	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know	6 6	6 6
it it interesting	3 1 6	3 1 6
it was always my impression	6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 4
invite and who not to invite	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6
i mean we	6 6 6	6 6 6
or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
which means the rangers are going to have a terrible year	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
in the last generation or so	6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4
we still ca ca put the boards in	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
and and they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
but it it really did you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
just the the earth you know what the earth is receiving back you know	2 4 3 1 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
hit the bags	6 2 4	6 6 6
uh frequency there or something	7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
as a conscientious consumer	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 4
gain the revenue that that being lost	6 2 4 3 1 2 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
i was living in northern jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4 4
it is bad everywhere in terms of	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6
i- i- i	6 6 3	6 6 3
seven hundred dollars in vet bills	7 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
let let say typical	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
and i wanted something else	6 3 6 3 2	6 3 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
so we are	6 3 6	6 6 6
but whatever youre youre promised they just	6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
it it such a dust collector to be	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
so there i was in old bankruptcy court	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 6 6 6 4 4
where the mother and the daughter and the son run it you know kind of thing	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 2 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
but i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
the the market i guess the	7 5 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
when i was in high school and how it is now for girls	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
so you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
i think just about to every place	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4

uh we finally- she she right at a year	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
on the outside-	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it like theyre theyre saying well	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6
evidently uh that that that that a big problem	6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
i never have	3 6 6	3 6 6

so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
i used to	6 6 6	3 6 6
were were were were now collaborating	6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6
blue smoke and mirrors was the one in eighty	7 5 5 5 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6
got a call while i was there	6 7 5 6 3 6 6	6 3 4 6 6 6 6
but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
well they talk about it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
we have a few uh of the real short stem	3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
was did did really want to be there and	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6
and i think that that a good idea	6 3 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
not a thing	2 4 4	6 6 6
the ones that are out now	2 4 3 2 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 6
it was everywhere	3 6 6	6 6 6
so what what the latest one youve youve read	6 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 1 6 6 3 3 1 6
so we used it a bit	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
add a heavier jacket or	6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh utilizing freon twelve	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6
yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
i- i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
it was very strange	3 6 6 6	6 3 4 4
from from personal parties or from these uh phone answering- phone uh commercial things	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
that is tough	3 6 6	6 6 6
it was disgusting when i read about it today	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
kindergarten next fall	2 4 4	6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
my wife and i have a a three year old	2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
but uh i	6 6 3	6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
i you know i do do know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
figure out what was what was blowing the fuse	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
but it just was was cost effective	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
our company claims it it not a constitutional issue	3 1 6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
see i had never really	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you know sort of	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
this is the kid who who really	3 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
as we know it today	2 3 2 3 2	6 6 6 6 4
i- i favor dogs over cats actually	6 3 6 2 6 2 6	6 3 4 4 6 4 4
the basics	2 4	6 6
theyre theyre not all boys	3 1 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 6
it it kind of a vicious circle is is it	3 1 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6
and nobody nobody got them1 yet	6 3 1 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
and uh buys clothes	6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6
i saw something on the news	3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
yeah i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
it was it was	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
so i mean you know ive ive got quite a few	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
like who knows you know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
how about you	6 6 3	6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
until they get down there	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i think that it it not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count	7 2 4 7 5 5 5 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 6
it it not the biggest either	3 1 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 2 4 4
i mean you	6 6 3	6 6 6
and you just boil them	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
well this thing	6 2 4	6 6 6
education i think is a lot of it	7 3 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh did you	6 6 3	6 6 6
and also uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty laughter-thousand	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
and uh it it uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
but that that only available if with the traction control and the other option	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
it it quite an undertaking	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
there there a city just west of frederick- of um baltimore called frederick	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
but we have about sixteen acres	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 4 4 4 4
and so ive ive got to have	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 2 4
and then i forget to bring them in the store	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4
how did you put that many miles on it in	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
are the major targets	6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6
national dulles and then uh baltimore washington	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
rather than bag it up because of all- all the	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 6 6
really understand it	6 6 3	6 6 3
but i do do know if ill ill	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now	6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i mean it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
a week	2 4	6 6
i think that the reason they are full	3 6 6 7 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i guess wed wed better get back to work huh	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
i graduated back in seventy	3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
i mean you might think youre youre paying something on time	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
but ive ive just never seen the attraction of having fish	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 4
and you know they told them1 that	6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
a who just graduated in civil engineering	2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but i do do want to take the chance	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6
so it it not like she she hungry	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6
it it easy listening	3 1 1 1	3 1 6 6
it it a possibility	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
i ca ca i	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
even when theyre theyre a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish	6 6 3 1 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
oh tomatoes bell peppers radishes and	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6
jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would	2 3 2 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
so what what your next purchase supposed to be	6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6
discipline- discipline okay	6 2 6	6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
do they say	6 3 6	6 6 6
it would have been devastated	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
but there is no known cure now	6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and so you	6 6 6	6 6 3
and then i had to wheel barrow it in	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and theyre theyre not um	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
the irony is is it it people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented	7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
they would would have anything to do	3 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think this is the first time that i have have been cut off by the computer	3 6 2 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
currently the way the law stands is is so much that the laws are enforceable or not	6 7 5 2 4 7 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
and i think you know you have to teach	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i i guess rowlett rowlett done a lot for the size town it is	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
and such	6 6	6 6
the only i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 4
and and where are the engineers coming from	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but she she uh she she that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color you know	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6
i did did get a raise this year	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
but you know im im sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
she is in boston	3 6 6 3	6 3 1 6
i i think that that about all i can	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 3 7	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
and then the recycler	6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4
i guess i watch tv tv if i have have read the paper that day	3 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
percent or so now	7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6
and that kind of interrupted the game	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
maybe there need to be some radical changes made	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
it is real relaxing	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but they so they were were you know	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6
i love it	3 6 3	6 6 6
well that that i mean that that very young for a baby	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
anyway he when he checked out	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
i probably	3 6	6 6
different kinds of opportunities	2 4 7 5	6 6 6 4
well good	6 6	6 6
weve weve got two children	3 1 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6
a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child	2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
and it really is is for some people that- who have been there	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
after school	7 2	6 6
so how do you know this much about um stealing cars	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
to do it	6 6 3	6 6 3
just it it it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
they they just	3 1 6	3 1 6
one reason why i like i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 4
and he only heard very you know piddly type	6 3 6 6 2 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it it very a typical for my reading though	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
but um i think	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
more fun things	2 4 4	6 6 6
certainly not	6 6	6 6
home from uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
it uh	6 6	6 6
frederick has a um	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
twenty more miles north	7 5 5 5	6 3 4 4
i know what you mean	3 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6
paid somebody to you know get supported	7 3 7 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it pretty funny	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
but it it a pretty neat town to just go and walk around if you like to walk	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
that that an interesting uh	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
did you see that where he the guy asked him for proof of who he was	6 3 6 3 2 4 7 5 2 3 2 7 5 3 1 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
so my kids	6 3 1	6 3 6
everybody over here likes crawfish	3 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 4
the the palestinians they they come in	6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
we started talking about gangs you know	2 6 6 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the scallops	6 6	6 6
and i looked at the credit card agreement one day	6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
i mean i have- i mean i can remember	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i guess im im probably a little more toward- toward the other direction	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
use an extra one for an office	6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
and you do do know what theyre theyre there for you know when theyre theyre coming how long theyre theyre going to be	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
but i had to	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
worked on cars ever since i was uh	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
and that when	6 6 6	6 6 6
i im im sure-	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
suppose because it you can easily be overheard overheard	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so your big beef with it is the uh	6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
that that laughter-that laughter-that absolutely right	6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6
this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country	6 6 6 3 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
and i think they need that	6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 4
and they	6 6	6 6
and it was the worst car ive ive ever owned	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
if he has them1 out cleaning them1 you know	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
that he just	6 3 6	6 6 6
it it not unusual for example for somewhere around here	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
go during the day	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
being the father figure	2 4 4 4	6 3 4 4
well that that great	6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
in kentucky we	6 3 1	6 6 6
in the future	6 2 4	6 3 6
uh scallops	6 6	6 6
i guess her schedule was shorter	3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
well most most	6 6 2	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
by the	6 2	6 6
and i said my goodness	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
it it like a macy macy kind of store	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 3 6 4 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and then taking those those qualities	6 6 6 6 2 7	6 6 6 6 6 4
why do uh is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
oh no	6 6	6 6
i guess i do have one thing	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
retired people people community	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
laughter-i laughter-mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions	6 6 7 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
i mean this is the kind of thing you look at	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 2 3 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
quite a bit	7 5 5	6 6 6
of making drugs real cheap	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
four or five	7 5 5	6 6 6
and they have one in the room	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
im im im im not on i am just getting into gardening this year	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 3 1	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6
you know it it just so hard	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
and uh you see how	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
so uh so that there are a lot of problems along that line also	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
she really- would have succeeded in a lot of ways that men that women were not able to succeed	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
a a true vietnam soldier	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
and it was- it was really pretty	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
so i just switched the channel up on it	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
im im wondering with the boom down here	3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
i know	3 6	6 6
that that still fairly new	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
it was a short van	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
kill anything i guess	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
im im laughter-terrible	3 1 6	3 1 6
well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system	6 7 2 3 6 2 4 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
and this lady you would think it was her own	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
on the whole im im pleased when i	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6
and uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not	3 6 3 1 6 3 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
disneyland i mean there there still a lot of people at disneyland	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you you a calculated- you know	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 2 4 6 3
uh justices are more apt to uh understand you know the crime- the prison crowding problems and things like that and have that sway their decisions one way or the other	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls	6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
the the	6 6	6 6
they make them hard you know	3 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
but i went home	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
about1 nine days	7 5 5	6 6 6
democrats are	3 6	6 6
subaru had a good reputation uh for you know	2 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6
uh i think	6 6 6	6 6 6
then when they come out with the new things you are like	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i have got some in the backyard that bloomed	3 6 6 7 2 4 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and i have a brother in his twenties	6 3 6 3 1 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
laughter-what laughter-in laughter-the laughter-world laughter-drugs laughter-are you know	3 6 2 4 4 7 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6
or or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway	6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
if you pay	6 3 6	6 6 6
up into the	6 6 2	6 6 6
uh political science	6 2 4	6 6 6
looking in	6 6	6 6
and i think that also goes	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
im im a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in	3 1 1 1 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 2 4	3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 2 4 4 6
i thought to myself how did how did	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
getting on with her life you know getting	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
you know and there were places that were cheaper	6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 2 4
things like that	2 4 3	6 6 6
it really does does	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
institutions and the corporate world	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
if since youre youre what democrat	6 6 3 1 6 2	3 6 3 1 6 6
that that where	3 1 6	3 1 6
and it just threw him out of the whole running	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
you go set up	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4
maybe what you could do if you could could get into a full family reunion	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 4
that that was an area that i- i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that were were taxed for	6 3 6 2 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
and he does it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 3
now days cannot cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 6
they just you know just scoot it on another spot on the	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 3
and some people would get military service	6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and then	6 6	6 6
who knows	7 6	6 6
the uh	6 6	6 6
what we had to do was	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
but he he still chewing	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
the changes come simply by statutory nature	7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
so um	6 6	6 6
uh yeah	6 6	6 6
if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
i do do know if once your your in they continue to do it	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
it is for drugs you know because1 you really ca ca	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4
be executed	6 6	6 6
i do do think he did anything at all	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i just wanted a law degree	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
but i think theyve theyve got a long way to go	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6
she could go in sometime when	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
but um it it kind of a different situation because youre youre probably living in an apartment right	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
well my dad dad in the in the solar energy business	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know the issues are	6 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 3
problem with the people on drugs	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 4
well what about random testing though	6 7 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and it seems to work pretty well so far	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
in the civil cases	6 3 1 1	6 3 6 4
my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store	2 4 4 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
i can either- read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that im im going to spend in there	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
im im surprised that the main people you work for	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
is based on their seniority	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
a more aggressive enforcement of state	2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 4 4 6
that may very well be	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
have the people	6 2 4	6 3 6
um and they sleep in the laughter-pop-up	6 6 7 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that measure stick across the board	2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 4
but there there just some little difference that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere	2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 4
fifteen cents a container	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
still taking care of the children is a very important job	6 6 2 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
say the commercial sector the motivation is is there for a lot of people	6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 2 4
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
and i went got to walk in the gas chamber	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
anyway so they could really only have four members on the team	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that theyve theyve had dry cleaned so they have got the crease	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
it it cheap entertainment	6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6
im im forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and if the fuel injection system breaks down there there no way in the world youre youre going to work on that	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 3 1 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
well back to the original subject	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
what what your favorite news	7 5 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 4
it it it	6 3 1	6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
but he actually	6 3 6	6 6 6
a little more assertive than i think i was	7 5 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
there there a difference too between east and west in the south	6 6 7 5 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
you know what	3 6 3	6 6 6
and then even my eleven year old boy	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
tore my arms off	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and interest is like eighteen or something	6 2 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4
well i- i feel that its uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 4 4 4
and things are getting worse	6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas is- is is correct	6 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
and i do do know what to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
supposed to appreciate them	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
that that	6 6	3 1
oh boy	6 6	6 6

well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
theyre theyre they still do do know what they were there for	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
within my company	6 2 4	6 6 6
and please say good-bye within the next five seconds	6 6 6 7 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4

and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
previews for it and all	7 5 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 2 4 7 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 6
business or youre youre in any kind of international	2 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
like a little goldfish	6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6
you know you really	6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6
and uh the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people	6 6 2 4 3 7 6 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
introducing more	6 2	6 6
caught being good slips	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
i do do i do do notice	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
well and ninja turtles	6 6 2 4	6 6 4 6
and then i	6 6 3	6 6 6
and the other thing too is you know between here and	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
i enjoyed having a lawn service	3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 4 4
if you if you hear a lot of old gospel	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
in comparison to boston	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4
im im so sick and tired of that	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh good grief	6 6 6	6 6 6
advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 4
how you get the edge	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
i understand	3 6	3 6
but even uh north carolinians they do do know	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6
and all of a sudden youve youve got to do something else	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
so i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
uh i have	6 3 6	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
keeping a job until you retire	6 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
um of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
do you all have much pollution there	6 7 5 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh i did did go vote	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
how did you	6 6 3	6 6 6
those people were like	3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4
i think we both know	3 6 3 7 6	6 6 6 6 6
but and i think the big problem though is is	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them1	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
and they do one year of volunteer work teaching	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
um actually it closer i think to a full year	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
for the	6 6	6 6
absolutely turned me off	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i did did like that either	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
of comparison do we have really	2 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
and i was probably about twelve at the time	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
uh television uh the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6
something like a uh state auditor	3 2 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4
and then when id id tell them you know well im im just not ready for children yet	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
anyway uh hope it it not going bad	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
the iraqis did did have a lot of high-tech weaponry	7 5 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 2 4 4
close to a thousand dollars an employee	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 1 6 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
um as they	2 4 3	6 6 6
hear you break in	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh i would say probably eighty percent of them1 that are caught	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking	2 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
so naturally she she retired	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
it it human factors	6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6
because i guess it it because1 of of ti down here	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
you had the same problems there right	3 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
versus a democratic uh government and arguing successfully	7 2 4 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 4 4 4 6 4 4
but it it it it hard to define	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
four and five	7 5 5	6 6 6
everytime everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it it a beer can	7 5 3 7 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 3 3 1 2 4 4
well that that about all i	6 3 1 6 7 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
but i think it would be a great idea	6 3 6 7 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i mean that that an internal problem to iraq	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
i just would would send them one of the questionnaires	3 6 6 6 6 2 7 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
tried to	6 6	6 6
but then when you look underneath it it it just got these little wheels and this just	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4 4 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
ive ive been	3 1 6	3 1 6
it did did work	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
ive ive heard a lot about that one	3 1 6 7 5 6 3 1	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6
so his kidsll kidsll sleep in the truck in the in the back of the bed	6 3 1 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4
well uh	6 6	6 6
might give some uh sort of false positive result	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and i do do think the us us will stand for it	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3
the handicapped group	3 1 1	6 6 6
sometimes fill-in fill-in the gaps or recognize	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
well it- it it his job too	6 6 3 1 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and yeah	6 6	6 6
there there so many christians	6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6
but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4
and save up some money i should should have too much trouble at all	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
but it it based out of that	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
you know i i wo wo say sparingly	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 3 1 6 4
that were were talking about the foundation of our legal society	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
they are are that accurate	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
um you know when they	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
is it doing a good job or a bad job	6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
is calling the company that they report	6 6 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they did did call them closets	3 6 6 6 3 2	3 6 6 6 6 4
was that downtown	6 3 6	6 6 6
trafficking has got them	2 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
and then they uh poof it off you know just like tarpley	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4
in prison you can	6 2 3 6	6 6 6 6
time to settle down and do something	7 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
and it showed who my uh	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 4 6 6
that would be great	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but i do do think it it difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place who or who are not just motivated who really believe that their	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 6
because one of these days ill ill be getting a six seater probably too	6 7 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
it would be a sort of day care	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4
i mean theyre theyre still not settled over there	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
you know less than i do	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
as a laughter-vote	6 7 5	6 6 6
and transplant and put some other plants down	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it um it it funny	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6
you add water	3 6 6	3 6 6
is it uh	6 3 6	6 6 6
carry the brunt of the load	2 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4
what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again	3 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
and then you go into the mental hospital	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
loves to listen to it	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3
but he held off the	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i im im kind of torn on this issue	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
at that time i could justify it in terms of	6 2 4 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
now this-	6 6	6 6
uh james avery	6 7 5	6 6 6
do you like the classics like uh gone with the wind and	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
not that i think he was good looking	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
for years	6 2	6 6
makes you wish they had uh still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6
my taxes have gone up	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do kind of live in the downtown area	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh you can	6 3 6	6 6 6
you know it it it it one thing you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 1 6 6 6 4
paralegals and stuff	7 5 5	6 6 6
that that for like an additional	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
so they got turned down	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
bizarre reason you decide you do do want it anymore	2 4 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 4
was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they wo wo do that you know for any for any situation really	3 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
since it it more expensive i think okay you spent that much money	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
that kind of thing	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
which was really the first year he was really able to	3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 4
things will pick up	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
gee how can you draw a conclusion from it	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class	6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
something like that	3 2 3	6 6 6
but now that im im there i mean it it it it a lot more convenient because1 there there so many kids that dawdle	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
uh like cockatoos	6 6 2	6 6 6
it keeps me very busy	2 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
well that that good	6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6
but um what i found out	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
c v a e	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
uh i it it it uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
but one one thing that i	6 6 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive noticed the houses around here are basically	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
sure enjoyed it	6 6 3	6 6 6
and i shot that thing one time	6 3 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
course weve weve got	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and it it over quick	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to this little what they call their caught being good store	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
and um you you listen a lot	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but i do do like the broncos	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
oh well that that not too bad	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i have not to be honest had much experience	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
quite a few do	2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6
im im not real interested in williamsburg because of the of the price attached to it	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
i just ca ca believe it	3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6
i did did realize that	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
to uh less control because1 i do do see	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
most of the time come up with the same idea the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory subscription	6 7 5 5 5 5 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 3
it the federal government is	6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
that that what i wanted to because i uh	3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
and i loved it	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 3
if their their willing to do it	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
embroidery work that was done on them	2 4 3 2 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
that that not too far from were we live	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
weve weve been two or three times and	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6
and i went out in the back yard to get brian	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i laughter-just-	6 6	6 6
stitches over two or three openings in the cloth	2 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
but they said in the dallas schools that that	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
but down here	6 6 6	6 6 6
over the years	6 2 4	6 6 6
has the nfl nfl nfl draft even gone yet	6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
you think it it never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
uh probably suspension tied into the brakes	6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 2 4
every adult	7 5	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
but certainly random testing the fact that people know that that they	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
he he got a three eighty	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 6
but rather it it on the rules of evidence	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4
it it would	6 6 6	6 6 6
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i can pick it out again because it it not typical	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6
um it was fun	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
although you know it it not really revenge because it does does mean anything to him	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 4
that much as far as uh	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
uh no halter tops and no shorts	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they never harmed her	3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6
uh just like it it taking a whole generation of people to finally uh realize the	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 4
that was excellent	3 6 6	6 6 6
much the same thing	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
it it just a put off	6 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 4 6
you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because1 theyre theyre all	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 6
or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 6 2	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
so i know like when she has an accident	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so now	6 6	6 6
especially the visa card	6 2 4 4	6 3 4 4
i worked for lincoln	3 6 6 2	3 6 6 6
what did you call that	3 6 3 6 3	6 6 2 4 4
and maybe that that that that probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
and they must wear	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
uh movies out now that i would like	2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
it it in a can that that	3 1 6 7 5 2 4	3 1 6 2 4 6 4
stuff when you only have	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
proves that youre youre not	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
i might still be working	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you know there are	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
um the players that are	6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4
are they	6 3	6 6
maybe they should	6 3 6	6 6 6
then we	6 3	6 6
for instance uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in	2 4 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6
the trash as they put it out	3 1 6 2 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 4
uh uh there was the	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well it it kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
well it it kind of it it	6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school	7 5 5 5 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but she uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and im im very mechanical	6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
and then i supplement that with uh	6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i- i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
they just they had a ball romping around	6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
these are the kind of people i would like to yeah- get out of here and get out of circulation and say i do do	3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 1
think that little the little chevy v eight when it started out in sixty in fifty	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4
when it becomes militant	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i was just going to say that- you should see those first- uh first if you can	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 4
it could be if they are after- they are not sure of themselves	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 2 4
well he was good	6 3 6 6	6 3 4 6
there there one or two others that just	6 6 7 2 4 4 3 2	3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
and i just feel much better	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
there there not enough room to plant	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
you know and just a lot of things that were were trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just do do protect them1	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
there there all sorts of systems where suicide	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 7	3 1 2 6 2 4 4 4
and bets	2 7	6 6
or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might	2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
they do do really buy the first quality	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
well that that you know that that fun	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
all the characteristics	3 1 1	6 3 6
it it it it certainly not a real upscale neighborhood	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean i can go in there	3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
older old people	2 4 4	6 6 6
or whatever	6 6	6 6
talking about the subject tonight- tonight which is some	6 6 2 4 6 2 3 6 2	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
companies drug testing prior to hiring	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 4
that that how i am	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
and as a matter of fact ive ive already done a second row of radishes	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
a a kind of far out way of thinking about it	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
do you have any little- nieces or laughter-nephews then	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
and i agree	6 3 6	6 6 6
um um that that sad	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
i just wondered	3 6 6	3 6 6
i think it would be good for people to serve	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and the guys get together	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
and then everybody else is stuck with that regardless of what they want to teach	6 6 3 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
in forty	6 7	6 6
um i hear that that nice	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
undo the credit that they did to them	6 2 4 3 1 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
it depends	6 6	6 6
it was was	3 6 6	6 6 6
that was very good	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
so do it anyway	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i ca-	3 6	6 6
i just about could really	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
and the police love it which really surprised me	6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
you put feed him small mice to big rats and things like that	3 6 6 2 4 4 7 2 4 7 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 6
some some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
and there can be no blue jeans worn	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
which i think he he outgrown now	3 1 2 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
a music store	2 4 4	6 6 6
but now it it coming back into favor	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
i do do know if the ti ti in dallas does or not	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
classify some of the builders	6 7 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 4
an officer in the air force	7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
so there was was any way i was going to go in there and vote	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
the bedrooms are too small	3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that they required you to do	3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
weve weve gotten to the point where you know if	3 1 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
she just does does like to do that	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
you know and i think most of that is because their parents are are around	6 6 6 3 6 7 2 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6
well i think it it going to	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and then they are out doing it again	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
but it it interestingly enough i am still	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
but i there there i think there there ways around it though that you know	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
you probably have a better team	3 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 2 4 4
up here then	6 6 6	6 6 6
because1 look how many years theyve theyve been doing that	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
it it supposed to filter the air for you in your home	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 2 4	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
until the kids were little	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
my mother was on the school board for eight years	3 1 6 6 3 1 1 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 4
and his brother has an akita	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
i have have had that extra motivation of of us	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
part of the hiring procedure	7 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6
with a credit card though was um	2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so i do do completely agree with that either	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i used to think well that that wonderful	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
i mean if you remember	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
they have um	3 6 6	6 6 6
i feel i feel for them	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
two backwards	2 4	6 6
do all these programs like headstart and things like those	6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but now i really	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i i do do know what the perfect solution to that is	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
well um	6 6	6 6
so far this year	2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
especially me	6 3	6 6
i do do even get a regular newspaper	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
im im here you know	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i mean it it glamorous taking drugs	6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
could be it	6 6 3	6 6 6
really a	6 6	6 6
i like sean connery	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
it it a hassle	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
i do do know how it works exactly	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
i do do feel well unless i am exercising	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
finding out this particular person- from this particular person	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
oh thirty miles each way	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
the assumption is that it is a problem	7 5 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that you do do know when	7 3 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
when i was had my little business was because uh	2 3 2 4 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6

there there	6 6	3 1
in durant oklahoma	6 3 2	6 6 6
i do do work for ti ti	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
maybe just the judge	6 3 1 1	6 6 6 4
have happened	6 6	6 6
i i just think employers have to have	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4
news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
im im all for it	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
with pot	6 2	6 6
we do do honor god with the first portion	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
there really was was a lot of difference	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
they do do really	3 7 5 5	6 3 1 6
what are what does your city have for gun control if anything	6 6 7 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
is uh	6 6	6 6
well you know the funny thing i find about american opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
they knew the sucker when they saw one	3 6 7 5 6 3 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but i do do want to be a laughter-lawyer	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that was the first time id id ever gotten any kind of drug screening	3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
is ive ive got the	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
does it	6 3	6 3
i thought he was great at the time	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
we just had a baby a couple months ago	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh the thing i do do like	6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 1 6
people of all ages take advantage of	2 4 7 5 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
it it funny that youd youd say that because there were homes in here that did did have any brick at all	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
the grass that that being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage	2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
and my fiancee has two kids	6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
there there one	6 6 2	3 1 6
uh yes	6 6	6 6
you know and they flipping me the finger and all that	6 6 6 3 6 3 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6
but but you have to do it as part is	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
because people have to vote in different area	6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
different from kentucky	6 6 3	6 6 6
do you follow professional sports at all	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and you laughed all the way to the bank	6 3 6 7 5 5 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
then uh and the importance of it because	6 6 6 7 5 2 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
uh my perspective is that you know ive ive been with	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
is is that the truth	6 6 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 4
and it happened to be my friend who lives laughter-a laughter-few laughter-blocks laughter-away	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
youve youve got to go through college youve youve got to get a job	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
different things that they need to get done	2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
is excellent in that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3
you do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and since it was was shipped to her address she could prove you know that it was was her	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 6 4 4
and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4
each case is presented to that group of	2 4 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6
and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry the automobile lobby is	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 2 4 4 4
are they paroling uh	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
because all the problems	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4
if you are having a dinner party on wednesday night you could do it on a weekend	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 3 6 6 2 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4

weve weve got some good um um hybrid burpee uh	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
and it yeah and it kind of uh	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that red cross	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 2 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
what ive ive taken to doing lately	3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 4
and im im sure theyll theyll fight it tooth and nail	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
that that very interesting	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
im im a	3 1 7	3 1 6
uh and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 4
the company is concerned	3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6
i im im i ca ca even remember if we do random sampling anymore	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
within a couple of years ago anyway was the last ive ive paid any attention to it	6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
i mean ive ive heard some songs that	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
a a freezer separate from	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
so callously and usually so	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
and that that it	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
freddy eats a nuclear warhead you know	3 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6
have some idea what it is anyway	6 2 4 3 1 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
budget this year	7 2 4	6 6 6
yeah i think the federal government is um is really far away from uh	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
they said we were were going to get any more for christmas	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i would say the majority of it it happening during the day	3 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 3 3 1 6 6 2 4
i know they do do some they do have some classes in um	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
what about the judge who who hearing the case	7 6 2 4 3 1 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
it is	6 6	6 6
was a very dramatic story	6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
i have two kids over there	3 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6
it just is amazing	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 4

and it it still tied up	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
of um	7 5	6 6
an introduction here	2 4 6	6 6 6
and loans do do pay for	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
the schools are there teach	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
anyway she she	6 6 6	6 6 6
so far this year- year or was it during the last year somewhere-	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
we took our honda to the honda dealership	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it was quite a lot of fun	3 6 7 5 5 2 3	3 6 6 3 6 2 4
in in dealing with a large company	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
actually um	6 6	6 6
two parent	2 4	6 6
is that i have heard that there are federal sentences	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4

we live close to dallas	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
but i just	6 3 6	6 6 6
what what if youre youre not doing it	6 7 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6

i do do if youve youve ever seen a map of wisconsin	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 3	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
i guess you have to make it a habit	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
think that i	6 6 3	6 6 6
work for ti ti	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
youd youd learn at this rate	2 4 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
and they said well you know he theyre theyre he has no job	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 4
that that what	6 6 3	3 1 6
and they send out this this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 3 6 4 6 6
and i want to scratch it out and put drafter	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
all you can do is put it in words	7 3 7 5 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
three judges basically	2 4 6	6 6 6
i mean we can were were even feeling the effects of the weather from uh	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6
and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 3
if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we would would have half the	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 3 6 4 4 4 4
i think probably in a smaller	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
just awful	6 6	6 6
we did did do that really this time	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6

in some states	6 2 4	6 6 6

or you just like it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
than- uh than than a positive factor	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4
demonstrated with this war	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
neighborhoods i mean theyll theyll	2 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
im im not sure why	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
there there other kinds of service for the country	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
see i went about	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
and she she just great	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
in the world	7 2 4	6 3 6
where if theyre theyre said hey	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
we had the same kind of problem	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
were were going to go to commerce and see a friend	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
uh my my solution to	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
more in line	6 6 6	6 6 6
how much he pays for it what his payments are	3 1 1 2 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
a single	6 6	6 6
can they go in there	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
oh that that nice	6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6
what are	7 6	6 6
on your own	6 2 4	6 6 6
next thing you know it it it it	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
we get paid	3 6 6	6 6 6
you probably know	3 6 6	6 6 6
their performances	2 4	6 6
if i had a child	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
and they did real fine	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
drugs because of uh	7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
my best friends are lawyers and you know all this	2 4 4 6 2 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
youre youre going to have to pay for it	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
mine were good	2 6 6	6 6 6
and it took me	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
now uh what particularly	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
how long you taught taught dallas schools	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
rather have lots of rooms and lots- lots of space	6 6 7 2 4 4 4 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty	6 2 4 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
uh ought to be able to have	7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and ours are real friendly	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and i think it it marvelous	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 3 1 6
but she got credits for it	6 3 6 7 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
this would be this would be frightening	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but if you want a nicer home	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 4
that that something ive ive been uh	3 1 1 1 1 7 5	3 1 6 3 1 6 6
we were talking about that just today	2 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
it is an attitude	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer	7 5 5 2 3 1 2 7 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
then you do do	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
and i guess maybe that that the way tokyo is too or japan is too	6 3 6 6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6
it used to be three dollars	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
in a lot of big cities	6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and and so theyve theyve kind of changed the	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
husband did that to you and you did that to your husband	2 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
in order in order to	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i mean i went in the service when i was eighteen	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 7	3 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 4
i i just do do know when im im ever	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6
he he a very good writer	7 5 2 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 4
theyve theyve had a	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
my husband- uh	2 4 4	6 6 6
overly revealing	6 6	6 6
so you know i was	6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 4
and i	6 3	6 6
that that an awful lot to uh	3 1 7 5 5 5 5	3 1 2 4 4 4 6
at least not by that name	6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
they ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
the food here is outrageous	2 4 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 4
the the public service thing again	6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 4 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
for gun control	6 2 4	6 6 6
uh unfortunately	6 6	6 6
well what i do do like about uh	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
we have we all have those kind of dreams too do do we	6 6 3 7 6 2 4 4 7 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 1 6
five to seven guns a day	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
yeah well i	6 6 6	6 6 6
i wanted i want to go see that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i think it it still the new york yankees you know	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
but i have no idea who it was that was in those stories	6 3 6 2 4 3 6 2 3 2 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
so did i	6 6 3	6 6 6
it was was any	3 6 6 2	3 6 6 6
and we hired a professional landscaper to do it	6 3 6 7 5 5 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 6
that room i showed you	7 5 3 7 3	6 6 2 4 6
oh wow	6 6	6 6
we were really affected	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh it	6 3	6 6
i- i think	6 3 6	6 6 6
do you have to pay for that too	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
needlepointed the	6 2	6 3
your your prior experience	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4
do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4
it it slow	3 1 6	3 1 6
im im glad you she was able to pull out of it uh	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so she she real	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean not to see it	3 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
and then there there a a much more um	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
and the the transportation situation is such that uh all the car pollution is is absolutely awful	6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
told me that daddy daddy going to whoop me to death	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do think that that going to work	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
im im not even	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i kind of remember back when gas prices started up	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
is uh closing up	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
where if you set a certain thing and say okay were were all going to have fried fish or were were all going to have fried chicken	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh theyve theyve had some financial problems with the team and so forth	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
that that why i said we	3 1 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 6
any way this this um school system thing	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
i do do think theyre theyre going to go to	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven	3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
i thinking all our cd cd that we have what i really laughter-like	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
the people that worked for those companies	2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
found an outfit down here to rebuild it	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
or were were going to force you	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
you know	6 7	6 6
um it just went up the first of this month	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
let let see	6 6 6	3 1 6
it it almost uh more fun than going to a major league game	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
and you know there i mean there there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
am quite	6 6	6 6
shoeless joe	3 1	6 6
and they they built uh	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
youre youre right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and the weed come up	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
if you buy through bean or though	6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 4 4 4 4
say for example in pensacola florida on that house	2 4 6 2 3 1 6 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
she a real hard lady-	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and he	6 6	6 6
on the inside	6 2 4	6 6 6
and a lot of that is diet	6 7 5 2 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
the the internal problems um somebody may step in again	7 2 4 4 7 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
then they start getting uh other people	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 6
you know that really makes	6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
force or whether it called a military pact	3 7 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
that was in the northern part- um up near cumberland mall area	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
public hangings	2 4	6 6
there there a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars and	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 7 5 2	3 1 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
i mean it it it it tempting when you see something to say well ill ill just charge it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i guess now she she practically a teenager	3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
how were you decorating the baskets	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
it it b a r	6 6 3 1 1	3 1 6 6 6
i uh	3 6	6 6
so it it no big deal for me to pick those up	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and she she thought for a few minutes	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6
im im in dallas texas	3 1 6 2 3	3 1 6 6 6
all right ron	6 6 3	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and that has that that pretty effective	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
well at least your your talking to somebody who counts	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4
for me	2 3	6 6
i- i think they should	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
it was really easy	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
the same block	2 4 4	6 6 6
and yet i i have a	6 6 6 3 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6
puts heaters in the front seats	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and um plastic bottles	6 3 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
it really irks me to see	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
but it it funny because here in california things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in in the sense of people being able to vote for things	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
uh use the money that weve weve paying them to	6 6 7 5 3 1 1 7 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
something like that for an extreme period of time	3 2 4 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
but that that that that about it	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6

and i apologize if youre youre a bird lover	6 3 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6
but if there are some people who do do agree	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
that could be a complicated too could could it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 1 6
if if i had a little bit more information along that line	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6
because we made him try a hot dog you know and	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6

it does make a difference	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
and i you know i do do know why they both	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 4
feels that he wants to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
could you hold on for just a moment	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and and you know but the way the courts are set up theyve theyve theyve theyve got so many chances for appeal	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is	3 7 5 5 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 3 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 4

im im pretty sure he was this past season	3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
our situation where were were dealing with an institution	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4

the huge one	2 4 4	6 6 6
uh various other	2 4 4	6 6 6
i im im guess im im not a good civil libertarian	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 4
you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges	6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
i became a technical writer	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
or just out of college	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
some- i i	6 3 1	6 6 6
uh customer of mine has a parrot	6 7 2 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4

and wisconsin	2 4	6 6
limited application in some respects	7 5 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 4
and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 2 4 7 2 4 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
buds planted uh already grown	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
a month at a time	2 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
they save a lot of they save a lot of energy	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and it was getting rusty	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
but yet that does not seem to have effected the	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
still could come	6 6 6	6 6 6
i might as well	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
well it it it is	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i	6 6	6 6
did did he have a woman	6 6 3 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 2 4
and you	6 6	6 6
and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
things of that sort	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
im im never faced with it because our school system in vermont	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
but id id be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
i tend to agree with you david	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
and things like that	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 3
then other people will wait up you know and	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
he probably knows	3 6 6	6 6 6
it gets so humid	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
big pain	7 5	6 6
it it nice	6 6 6	3 1 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
and theyre theyre not	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
or fifty seven a hundred	2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
five people	2 4	6 6
and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the the recreation center and do it helps a lot	6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 3 1 1 7 5 2 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i do too	3 6 6	6 3 6
i think that	3 6 3	6 6 6
well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
so uh i lived in kansas city for a couple years	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
my paper-	2 4	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
or she she i guess	6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
alternative occasionally that i like to use	7 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know to live	6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6
and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious	6 7 5 5 2 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
what- what is the name of that	6 7 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
he he	3 1	3 1

i think it it	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
catch a baseball game actually	6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
daughter to you know put her through college and stuff	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4

there there no question about it	6 6 7 5 5 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
that i think it might make a difference	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4
and you know theyre theyre just real shallow people	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
organic you know materials and foods and things	7 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
it takes a yeah it does take some space	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 2 4
there there a uh	6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6
i mean there were five of us	6 6 6 6 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i think i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4

prance around them and and paw at their face	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4

a year or two in in public service	7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4

oh wow	6 6	6 6
a part of everyone everyone consciousness	2 4 4 3 1 2	3 6 3 6 6 6
it bothers me that i hear a lot about um	6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6
and here with the peace corps were were talking about all these people that are are even in our own country when there there enough people	6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 1 6 4

that that that that in uh texas stadium where the football players play	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
at least they might be some benefit in that	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4
now i asked janice somebody recently	6 3 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
it sure does	3 6 6	6 6 6
you know it is just	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh i was recording	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4
really practice- first generation divorce in our family	6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
the yards yards all fenced in	7 5 5 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
and yet he bought like seventeen gallons	6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
americans are paying too much in taxes	7 6 6 7 5 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
i do do know how it is in georgia	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
and that that hard	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
laughter-right i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
uh and they have a good time and everything	6 6 2 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
well but you got to look at prohibition though	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4
or just you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
just being born right now	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
i do do think the judge should have	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i ive ive just gone blank	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and do um	2 4 4	6 6 6
because uh we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
like for a bib or something like that	2 4 4 4 7 3 2 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
i do do see how we could have made it	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i noticed that about things like	3 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 4 6
though of course they can too	2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
so were were in garland	6 3 1 6 2	6 3 1 6 6
and i love the space	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
so it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
auto repair	2 4	6 6
and there was another town called barry saint edmunds	6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
by uh voting laws uh from registering- from their eligibility to register	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4
you know they could could even take hand-offs	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i said why are they so expensive	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
all that other good stuff that ate them1 all up	2 4 4 4 4 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
that that what-	3 1 6	3 1 6
i mean when you have a man that that signed a	3 6 6 3 6 7 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 4 3 1 6 6
but what they do is employ um homeless i think mostly men but homeless people	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
the more or less like entertainment stuff	7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
i go out there almost as much as the orioles	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and somebody will turn it in	6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
as a result	7 5 5	6 6 6
all these gangs kids could join to belong	7 5 5 2 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so i think it it a good idea	6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i forget how she got it	3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
of course he did did die	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 1 6
but it it hard to think that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 7	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
a car that that big enough for six	2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
laughter-feels laughter-like laughter-i laughter-must have done nothing	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
almost all of them1 had a montessori section	7 5 2 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
home sick	2 6	6 6
and uh maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
something you have to do	3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
and i think that there are there- there are solutions	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
more laughter-from laughter-men	2 6 7	6 6 6
but when you consider they could be	6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
while i was finding people i uh	6 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
south austin	2 4	6 6
well i know in	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
so well this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
it it going to take all of us you know getting together and just saying we are not going to take it any more	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4 4
but now ive ive ive ive learned how to sew	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and just be a little	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
it sounds like youd youd have	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
oh you mean	6 3 6	6 6 6
top five i think of	7 5 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 3
and- and lebanon	6 6 2	6 6 6
and that that how they continue the	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 6
i certainly hope so	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 2 4 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
uh for washington you know which is	6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
in tac	6 7	6 6
iraqi now is the	7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and you get tired of that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
that that fun	3 1 6	3 1 6
the downtown areas	6 6 6	6 6 6
really into politics	6 6 7	6 6 6
fifteen thousand dollars	2 4 4	6 6 6
in front of the public so they understand how	6 7 2 4 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
you know were were trying to decide what what to	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
per say	6 6	6 6
covering on the wall	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
hell hell have to come back out	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
all this freon twelve stuff into the	2 4 4 4 4 7 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
but you can go ahead and buy them1 cooked and shelled	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
like the conservation corps back in the thirties or	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
sooner or later i need one	6 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4
but i was bored part of the time too	6 3 6 6 7 2 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
but theyre theyre not in public school yet	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
we sent them to camp	3 6 3 6 7	3 6 6 2 4
and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
my father father company was starting	2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
they were both working at whatever things were needed to be done	2 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
but it was was worth anything	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
well out of	6 6 6	6 6 6
i i believe in the trial by jury	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
places and let them1 cut the yards paint the houses	7 6 6 7 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4
but then im im an american	6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
all these places that ive ive never been	2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
it laughter-is	3 6	3 6
i like everything he he done so far	3 6 3 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
that that the one	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
i have a baby	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
there has to be some sort of discipline	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
beats me	6 3	6 6
do do do it around here	6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4
well my husband is telling me we have to hit the laughter-road	6 2 4 6 6 3 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
that that uh yeah	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
room for advancement	7 5 5	6 6 6
and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the the lower the lower schools	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
i agree	3 6	6 6
most the time	2 4 4	6 6 6
some of the some of the women women roles i think are almost for the worse because were were losing out on some things going back to work	6 6 6 7 2 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6
would be insurmountable	6 6 6	6 6 6
an invasion that turns out to be not invasive	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that really stupid	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
it it boring	3 1 6	3 1 6
see what do we recycle	6 7 6 3 6	6 6 2 4 4
and this is just another time that it it happening	6 2 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 3 1 6
shoot them1	6 3	6 6
ive ive got a piano	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 4
do you want to start	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i i	6 6	6 6
ill ill just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i think that that really what what been hurting uh the uh rangers	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 4
were were talking about capital punishment	7 5 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
i it it does does seem like i get enough time to watch much tv tv	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
because theyre theyre getting better every year	6 3 1 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i i could could imagine	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 1 6
are you talking about with criminal or civil suits	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
well im im from kentucky	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
we used to do it at home when i was a kid had a huge garden	2 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
well maybe if they could um if they had more money or more more resources to work more on rehabilitation	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4
but uh that was that that the extent of which i guess that that more than	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 4
because before they used to have um	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so i had	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know i- i like the concept theyve theyve got now where they have more directed education you know	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 3
that that the way my mother stands on it	3 1 7 5 2 4 7 5 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 3
i have a younger brother like that	3 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 2 4 4 6 6
so you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
a couple of years ago	7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 4 6
well i checked a lot of places out you know the kinder cares and the	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i could see if a kid does does have any encouragement	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
well there there a sense of it being a package	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that was his big deal	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
you never know	3 6 6	6 6 6
are you going to trade it in on this new one	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6
youve youve got to buy something and stick with it	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
but theyre theyre still theyre theyre still a lot i think	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i did did base everything on that	3 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and they have a number you can call	6 3 6 7 5 3 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
that have taken that approach	3 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 4
than to think that somebody turned me in	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6
you know point blank in the crime	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
but we felt like you know	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
and it it you know it it got to the point now where even our our police departments and our dea dea dea agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 3 3 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
theyve theyve got a very well rounded team	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
i wish it were a little bit	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
the military does does	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
i thought that maybe something	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
well i guess being from	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
then youre youre terminated	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and uh you also do do see the litter there	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
oh this was just obviously yanked	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
the one i talked about the other night was good	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so what else do you think is important	6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
some of the things he was just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6
so um	6 6	6 6
you know i i would would have to worry about satisfying my	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
more taxes or better management of what they got	7 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 7	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
we both work together	3 2 6 6	6 6 6 6
so there could be a lot of things that they could	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
rate that you have to pay	2 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
or laughter-as loose as loose can get	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the united states and suddenly	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 2 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 4
oh lord i mean yeah	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
oh absolutely	6 6	6 6
so the you know the government does does have to deal with it	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
crazy for him to	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i think this is like two years ago	3 6 3 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i have a subaru	3 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
it it also got a full inside	3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 1 6
uh i mean	6 6 6	3 6 6
i bet	3 6	3 6
were you in sac	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i- i	6 3	6 6
i was an investigator	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 4
well then how can a democracy work then	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
uh dress code so to speak there	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i am going to bet you that is a lily	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
pull all this weight	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
to uh some other people	6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4
i- i do do claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
and uh we really seem to be pleased with her	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you just leave- leave it out	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and im im kind of	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i may still be	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
we do do have a lot of that	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i get so tired of you know these you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
uh i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
how should they do it	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre always always happy	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
uh lists for phone solicitations	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4
and when we um put our house in	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
have us	7 3	6 6
no kidding	6 6	6 6
is it	6 6	6 6
a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being	2 4 4 4 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4
of the slick paper like magazines	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
oh my husband says i might buy it	6 2 4 6 3 6 6 2	6 3 4 6 6 4 6 6
because uh most likely that will happen wo wo it that you know	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
you know private you know business	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
both in standing up	7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
an air about him that you ca ca help but enjoy what he is doing	7 5 5 3 1 1 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
oh no	6 6	6 6
and then you start-	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
i mean i im im not making excuses for	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
what is she	7 6 3	6 6 6
and theyre theyre only there to perpetuate their own their own power structure	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 4
and i heard	6 3 6	6 6 6
do it	6 3	6 6
i- i do do necessarily need to uh be involved since im im pretty much on a low level	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that door county	3 1 1 1	3 1 6 6
im im an engineer	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
um women choosing to not work after they have a baby	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
he just get one more	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
that that okay too	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
right before you start	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and so weve weve been out there a couple of times	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
on monday i i wear the the worst looking one	6 2 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6
im im not kidding you	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
the only thing about mine um	7 5 5 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
the water usage you know they try to limit	2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
like jobs	6 7	6 6
we do do get it either	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
if she wanted to go to combat i do not see that they should stop her	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6
and and then they say well if you give them the right to do this	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
but i think that that great about ti ti	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
an internship up here	7 5 6 6	3 6 6 6
so ive ive had this dog now for for sixteen years	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
here in saskatoon at least the majority of	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
we were lucky-	3 6 6	6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
those things go fast	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
but in	6 6	6 6
but theyre theyre discipline problems	6 3 1 2 4	6 3 1 6 6
these people	3 1	6 6
they they do	6 3 6	6 6 6
oh are you	6 6 3	6 6 6
you have have	3 6 6	6 6 6
he he been there a couple of months now	3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
i mean it it not	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
jugs plastic milk jugs	7 2 4 4	6 6 4 6
it it just that uh	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
two thousand dollar option there to	2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
and people are finally taking some action against it	6 2 6 6 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6
them1 to completely turn loose of their controls either	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know it it a different viewpoint	6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and we stick to it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
it it not going to be overnight	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and then the cadillac is is definitely a used car	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 4
that that exactly what i do	3 1 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
everyone does newspapers	3 6 2	6 6 6
and this sort of thing you know	7 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
keep him quiet	6 3 6	6 6 6
and plus	6 6	6 6
and they wind up	6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6
uh that	6 3	6 6
ive ive only had two instances where i could- it was really noticeable	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
they seem pretty you know	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
you know	6 6	6 6
oh there there one in salem	6 6 6 7 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
it it essentially trivial statistics	3 1 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6
i agree it should be in effect	3 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but i you know i	6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
and they had a little uh theater company	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
maybe it is	6 6 6	6 6 6

just well for a lay over	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4

and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
and they were never	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
i guess	3 6	6 6
i do do feel very	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
nor do we	6 6 3	6 6 6
how to combat it	7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6
and the whole	6 2 4	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
into investigating some of the other	6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6

they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4
uh no	6 6	6 6
uh if you have a disagreement with someone	6 6 3 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i have seen that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 3 6 2 4 4	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4

in plano	6 2	6 6
you know now well now as far as i am concerned and now i could be wrong about this but	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6
it will	3 6	6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
a little bit better for us so to speak	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it was her ex boyfriend	6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4

now you understand	6 3 6	6 6 6
and it it a daily thing for her	6 3 1 2 4 4 6 3	6 3 1 6 4 6 4 4
and i guess youd youd report that to	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
he has anxieties now	3 6 2 6	6 6 6 6
animals have a way of laughter-talking	2 6 2 4 7 5	6 6 2 6 6 4
type thing	6 6	6 6
and look	6 6	6 6
maybe well well see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
well especially you know well	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and when they came back theyd theyd have to serve this	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i am at work right now	3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
they do do have the self-esteem that they need to have	3 6 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
they theyve theyve never had a job	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
she said no	3 6 6	6 6 6
but i am opposed to	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
why is it happening	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4
they they still have have gotten used to the dry land	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
oh do you really	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
check it back and just grab it you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and not-	6 6	6 6
it it one of those things that you learn the hard way	3 1 7 2 4 4 3 1 2 7 5 5	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
so i never	6 3 6	6 6 6
well that that quite all right	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
the different designated areas for smokers and stuff	7 5 5 5 5 2 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and her eyes- she she sort of unicolor you know	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
as far as uh shrubs and things like that because1 theyve theyve got to get a chance to find the find the cracks in the rock	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
the vet called her uh a golden mix	2 4 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i i do i do listen to a lot of	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3
i guess i see overall beneficial if if were were going from that point of view	3 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
i do not know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
far as you know crime in the cities im im sure	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6
but things are generally packaged in the english sized packages you know	6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 3 6 4 4 6 6 3
oh okay	6 6	6 6
and i just had the biggest grin on my face	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
i in	6 6	6 6
so she was always uh home	6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 4 4 4
had a good time down there	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
i could easily envision that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
it seems like	6 6 6	6 6 6
we always we had that bread that was uh um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
it really is	6 6 6	6 6 6
in order to get in you have to be able to	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
and that that not going to	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3
you know so thered thered be	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
it turned out to be uh uh an invitation	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
and it just	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know that	6 2 3	6 6 6
so uh	6 6	6 6
i do do think radio is as bad to do that as tv tv is	3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
into a real busy schedule as far as	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
and you know it it gonna gonna really hurt the the middle class uh people i think	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
it just	6 6	6 6
and and uh she was was able to jump	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the open office	2 4 4	6 6 6
there there no possible way that you could	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2	3 1 2 4 6 2 4 4
and uh this was during a holdup of a uh	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4
can you how can you	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i mean it it a nursing home or something like that	6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
i think he he very interesting	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
but then but you know everything is relative to when uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
nothing wrong with that	3 2 4 3	6 6 6 6
i mean i know that that what my father-in-law was talking about you know	6 6 3 6 3 1 1 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
twenty i guess	2 3 2	6 6 6
unless that was one of their the focus of their main stories	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
and you know wed wed hed hed fly down there on mondays and fly back on fridays	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4
uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know if id id know how to handle	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4
say the end of the civil war	2 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
um that that when i had the subscription	6 3 1 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
that- that sounds a lot like a walt disney film	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and i do do think we did it	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and it it just	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
you know i i guess i can see it from several different perspectives	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
youll youll get	3 1 6	3 1 6
you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
you know i do i switch the	6 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 2 4 6
it does	3 6	6 6
oh that that good	6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6
i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
they they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
last time i was there was fall so probably was was that bad	7 5 3 7 5 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 6 3
im im leasing the lexus	3 1 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6
well good	6 6	6 6
i mean some kids do do get do do get spanked at home	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 3 1 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
ive ive never heard anything about this before	3 1 6 6 3 7 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
thing on the bottom- bottom of the- on top of the barrel	7 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
it it getting more and more like that where there there more and more couples	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
they gave a run down that texas	3 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and if they refuse-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i do not i do not know because1 i am not real	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
will not have freon twelve in their systems	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well i am uh the product of	6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i do do mean college	3 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
well does your	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh boy	6 6	6 6
had to mess with my phone here	6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and then you hear	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and uh i think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
i use	3 6	6 6

and some places	6 6 6	6 6 6
unpopular status	2 4	6 6
i even went-	6 6 6	3 6 6
so i could could smell this	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6
and then i have	6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4
during college you know maybe have some kind of course where theyd theyd be required to do some kind of community service type work and	6 2 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
it depends on what you had when he were a kid right	2 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3
and the plant was	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
like you know in school they did did teach you about	6 6 6 6 2 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
that that	6 6	3 1
was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4

for a while when we were really interested uh we saw it all the time	6 7 5 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well especially with something where you have to find- you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt	6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 4
work you know	2 6 6	6 6 3
if you have something against somebody to go to them1 first	6 3 6 3 2 3 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
male and female are both responsible for doing this	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4

and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and wentworth and uh sae sae sae	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 2 3 2 3 2 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4
and you and you	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3
you have to to prove that youre youre teaching them something	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 4
they hold it on the week no they hold it on a either a saturday or a sunday or at least a day when when uh a great	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 7 2 4 7 2 4 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
their integrity being questionable	2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6
cars made in the sixties and stuff	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
it all starts	6 6 6	6 6 6
and you- and you know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff	6 2 4 3 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
and here here this bum that did did have a job	6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
as well as the shape of the person person legs	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4
and i watch i i watch their sports up there	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i have four	3 6 2	6 6 6
you just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it	7 5 2 4 7 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6
i see	3 6	6 6
at different schools	6 2 4	6 6 6
two levels of it the one from seventeen hundred -until	7 5 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
and it it not very expensive that way	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
we had to call the insurance company	3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 4
i do do know when were were going to have vacation to do it	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
engineer at	7 6	6 3
i mean	6 6	6 6
so that people would use this stuff reuse- over again	6 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
well there there yeah there there there going to be some measure of incentive	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
he he getting his doctorate in industrial	3 1 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 4
we saw part of the african queen on on tv tv	3 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
you can be better than that	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
i figure well youre youre baking it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 3 1 6 6
and then applying in the styles	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
anyway so um	6 6 6	6 6 6
but he jumped in in the the river	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
or is it the f b i	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
that that tough	3 1 6	3 1 6
but and theyve	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know amateur- as	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
is it working	6 3 6	6 3 6
but i know that last year	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
especially if theyre theyre found guilty of the crime	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 2 4
instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you need- you	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
but some of them1 are really nice	6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
seems silly that uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon	6 7 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
laughter-it laughter-it human rights in the sense	3 1 2 4 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
that that just like kids you know	3 1 6 6 2 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
course my job was such that i did did i could could do it as much as i wanted	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
you know weve weve had i guess laws against uh	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 1 6 6 4 4 4 6
so it was was so bad	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
you know id id id id like to think that that is is true	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
i have probably planted	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
one place i think i did did take her	2 4 3 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i mean prohibition certainly did did last	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6
and i think that does make a difference	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
he he a little brat	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 4
you know like standards i guess you could call it	6 2 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
we have one football team as far as laughter-were laughter-were laughter-concerned	3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
was like last year they had forty	6 6 3 1 1 6 7	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i do do know what kind of work you do	3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the uh attendant uh support vessels	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 4 4
because you never know	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 4
oh i know	6 3 6	6 6 6
and part of it is california you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements	6 7 2 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 4 4
it really is is	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
buying power over the age you know under the age of thirty or so to	7 5 2 4 4 6 2 4 7 5 5 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3
i was surprised uh	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
well i do feel like a little bit like	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that probably not true only for atlanta but for just about anywhere	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
you know they get together with a bunch of guys	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
and my youngest was only uh two and a half	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
we used to watch um him and i guess john chancellor	2 6 6 6 6 3 2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
and that that always something that you know you just do do real you do do think about	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
a deterrent	2 4	6 6
is a	6 6	6 6
i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is	3 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 7 5 6 7 5 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4
i wish was an avid camper	3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 2 4 4
organized battle between the two	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
i mean those	6 6 6	3 6 6
i think one of them lives in germantown	3 6 7 2 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know the lower level courses i sometimes wondered you know	6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
but sometimes it it just it it baby	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
i got the peas	3 6 3 1	6 6 2 4
anything at all	3 6 6	6 6 6
i can handle	3 6 6	6 6 6
and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
the library has a paper	2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
the economy around here is	7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6
my parents through the	2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
but i i can tell you when i do do it on a regular basis i feel so much better	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4
it is scary	3 6 6	6 6 6
to report it	6 6 3	6 6 3
i do do think she checks things out very well	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it sure is	6 6 6	6 6 6
i ca ca get up high	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and you know they	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
you could could get a job to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i i i do not know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i would would	3 6 6	3 6 6
emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6
so youd youd youd youd rather see it	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and i have- we have a news you know	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 3
theyre theyre usually the worst one of all	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 7	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
the rest of it was all hog wash	2 4 4 3 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
get the type of degree they want	2 7 5 2 4 3 2	6 3 6 2 4 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
where you from	6 3 6	6 6 6
is it	6 3	6 6
when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
but we have several guns around the house	6 3 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 4 4 6 6 4
oh oh oh oh i know what youre youre talking about	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
it it someone you know keeping an eye on the kids	3 1 1 1 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
we were were bothered that much by mosquitoes	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
but he would not vote before that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
when people in industry have been getting cut back and youre youre getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey wait a minute	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4
those are the only only issues we ever fight about	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
yeah- if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
you end up being your own person	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 4 4
well nowadays you have to be	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
that i think there there going to be more	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
that sounds like my my kind of	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 3
magnum gun school	2 4 4	6 6 6
i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who who well educated to be able to	3 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i think um	3 6 6	6 6 6
so i do do have as much time	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
but i i really think that in	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you could always make them the slave of the	3 6 6 6 3 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
stayed in for ten years	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 4
i mean i feel really sorry for these people	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that mine	3 1 1	3 1 6
and he says well hopefully i wo wo have to change them before i trade it off	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
things like that	2 4 3	6 6 6
it was raining	6 6 6	6 6 6
but other than that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
oh wow	6 6	6 6
the cream of the crop i guess you could say	7 5 5 5 5 3 7 3 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
it it just a matter of passing the law	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
when you do that	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
and they do do allow um	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
using things against us later on anyway	2 3 2 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that guy guy going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or	3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 7 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
um there there there there different value placed on human life and uh right down the list you know possessions and	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 7 5 6 2 7 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
um a twelve pack then that that like twelve cents back	6 7 5 5 6 3 1 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 6 3 4 6 4 4 4
always will be	6 6 6	6 6 6
i was stationed in in turkey for for a year and a half	3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
i did did	3 6 6	3 6 6
you- you know what i mean	6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 3 6 6
you you know what im im saying	6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 1 6
and it	6 3	6 6
i do do know whether i pay too much taxes	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
what im im doing right	3 1 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
so i built a box	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
i mean i think in this sort of	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
youre youre not gonna gonna	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
well when i came home	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
well there there there there a guy on that was on norm	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
it it gonna gonna	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
um yes	6 6	6 6
going to try to legislate	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
keep them forever	6 3 6	6 6 6
and uh and so	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
saint claude	3 1	6 6
and we went back	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
women and not to men	2 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 4
they did did	3 6 6	6 6 6
places like ross dress for less and uh	2 4 3 1 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
of that crime	6 3 1	6 6 6
took it up there	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
the mpv mpv mpv is more of uh	3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
so it it it it kind of strange it you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4
and when i was a child i did did really know my dad very well	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles	7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 7 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
the neighbor neighbor	7 5 5	6 6 6
well i heard it that i heard it that time	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
you just	3 6	6 6
as far as security and that sort of thing	6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
but then again it it just like all those nutcases out there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
where they have the you know the little partition dividers	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
on on on one hand you- on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
like they just	6 3 6	6 6 6
uh i put him	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
or out in the country	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 3 1 6
and i have have been doing it	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
well that that	6 6 6	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
um i put out a	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and so we we in our minds were were thinking	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
that was- that was pretty good	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4
worried about that	6 6 3	6 6 6
involved in	2 4	6 6
for you know	7 6 7	6 6 6
oh the book is really good	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
has something to do with the	6 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 4 4
my fiancee fiancee family family from wisconsin	2 4 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i would say	3 6 6	6 6 6
in uh red square or wherever said okay	7 2 4 4 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but whether it it something that they can put to	6 6 3 1 1 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6
so we we definitely have different tastes	6 6 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i think so too	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
to see	6 6	6 6
well anyway im im sorry i did did i did did have	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6
i looked laughter-conservative- and all that stuff	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
ten bucks at least or somewhere in there	2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and there only is supposed to be limited edition	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and ive ive been watching them every day	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
like a friday afternoon when im im tired it it the end of the week and i just want to go home	6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
it makes it worthwhile to take it back	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
to uh	7 5	6 6
bah humbug	6 6	6 6
that- that-	3 1	3 1
well ive ive had my	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i uh	3 6	6 6
it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
or if you you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
that that okay	3 1 6	3 1 6
i im im trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6
but they had a good time	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
it has	3 6	6 6
that that considered a privilege not a right	3 1 6 2 4 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4
i think it started in about nineteen seventy	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 2 6 6 6 4 4
id id feel better	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
kind of small town	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6
things and learned how to do things differently	2 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through follow-through with that	6 2 4 4 4 6 2 7 5 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
are they gonna gonna be taught nothing	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
where you you turn it	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
that i did did ever understand	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in two of the areas in uh in the washington suburbs	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
but he he organizing people	6 3 1 6 7	3 6 6 6 6
i mean even to	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
so i usually try to combine it with uh catching a couple of games somewhere	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
resistance to the idea of	7 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
when you are	6 3 6	6 6 6
they both moved way out	3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
voluntarily give it because someone asks	6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
that could be done you know	3 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
of composition writing	7 2 4	6 6 6
and it it hard to get them out	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
generally i do do think they are	6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
more of the game plan of how do they convince the	2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 2	6 6 3 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
i do do think theyre theyre ever going to prove that men and women are laughter-equal	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
red october again	6 6 6	6 6 6
i can see that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
laughter-but ive ive been trying more this year	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
because i teach school	6 3 6 2	6 3 4 4
whatever whatever left over is disposable income- disposable	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
i was i	6 6 6	6 6 3
i you know i do do know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
and they said theyd theyd keep her there for three days	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society	7 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
well that that diminished by	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
we screwed around and waited too long	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that we do do get fixed	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
as a	6 6	6 3
ill ill have to admit i do do i do my own yard	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
and there there four two girls and two boys	6 6 6 7 2 4 7 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
you they do do have maternity leave	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
these are are pets	3 6 6 2	6 3 6 6
you know it it their money	6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
i think that that what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty	3 6 3 1 1 6 7 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 2 4 4
we were just out recently at the outer banks of north carolina	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are are	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
oh about	6 6	6 6
i believe it costs about ten dollars	3 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 4 4 4
it it not clear to me that it is really a problem	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4
some of the cases ive ive heard about over the years	7 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
very seldom	6 6	6 6
well you said you have kids	6 3 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 2 4 4
really independent	6 6	6 6
well we could talk about that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
so it it got into the carpeting got into the floor	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
now impact is kind of bad too though	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and indeed his trend started upward	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
uh i do do think i would either	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy	3 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
what if we	7 6 3	6 6 6
you know sometimes you have to ask them for that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
rich poor or in between	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and uh it it just human nature to walk through an open door	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
you become callous	3 6 6	6 6 6
theyre theyre afraid theyre theyre going to get sentenced to death	2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
my kid kid a great kid and all this	3 1 1 2 4 4 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
i had a waiting period on my pistol because1 i was down in uh tennessee	3 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
they they just have like outhouses	6 3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 4
able to have the recognition	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4
oh yes	6 6	6 6
well you would think that they would get that in the uh	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and it it probably gone by now	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
i just was there you know	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
the belts	2 4	6 6
do you feel like that that an invasion- invasion of certain people people	6 3 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
they have have gone down	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you know helpful things	6 7 2 4	6 6 6 6
like i when i was home- i went home	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
ive ive been pretty lucky about	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
and it it not uh it it not a hard back book	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 3 4 6 6
uh they could be made uh you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
they never learned to be responsible when	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
we ca ca we ca ca balance a checkbook without a calculator	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4
they they designed it and everything	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4
so it does does matter	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i saved that issue actually	3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4
an ibm ibm ibm pc pc	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
out of the norm not to find something that is is air conditioned	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 4
but that that was my first real experience	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
to go either as an apprentice which they	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh claustrophobia i mean	6 7 3 6	6 6 6 6
really tried they would would have to	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and then we have to take another one that that mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
kind of moved up	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
im im not saying theyre theyre all bad	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 4 6 6
fountain i mean my water faucet	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4
and there there a power structure that you have bow to	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
instead of wallpaper	6 6 7	6 6 6
ill ill bet you did	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
i was too	3 6 6	6 6 6
but the story	6 2 4	6 6 6
i mean we need to redo some rewiring ourselves	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
are they really even educatable or trainable	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it was one of those things	6 6 7 2 4 4	3 6 6 2 4 4
well that that real neat	6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
and he	6 6	6 3
i do do have the foggiest notion what it is about	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
it seems like a lot of it that it is more	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
oh that that nice	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
uh of	7 5	6 6
and now were were up to proposition hundred and	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
it it it it not just antilock brake	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 1 6 6 4 6
and i guess also youre youre going to see the first of the uh crack kids	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 2	6 6
certain- if you look at other cultures	6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 4
uh no no what we call broad base taxes	6 6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
so uh	6 6	6 6
uh especially1 well the black gospel	7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
am in favor of it	6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
youre youre with the home office now	3 1 6 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
right now i do do see it making a difference	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
um when	6 6	6 6
i i could could see having fish like that	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
the uh the	6 6 6	6 6 6
and actually ive ive started working up there in the afternoons too	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
think youre youre just a number you know	6 3 1 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i think they do that for most everybody	3 6 3 6 3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i know i never felt	6 3 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
i mean i feel like if	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
no matter how much the	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it was dukakis	6 6 7	3 6 6
and there there not enough time um	6 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
uh i guess not	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
what what amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years	3 1 6 6 7 2 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
that we have such a fragmented system for uh	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
she knows when im im upset and i know when she she not feeling good too	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6 6
and ive ive been drug tested three times	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
the three fifty in the van	3 1 1 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 2 4
they do do get spanked very often	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
organic fertilizers and	7 5 2	6 6 6
i guess a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war um	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
and so youre youre basically you sit	6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
ive ive been through there	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
record should	2 6	6 6
youve youve got to start them1	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4 4
uh in a secretarial position	2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 6
i put my work number	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i do	3 6	6 6
typically feeling	6 6	6 6
my uh my roommate is a uh	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and he so far he he bitten ten people	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 3 4 6 4 4
and uh loved that thing	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
they they try to do it just from the selling the water	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it	2 4 4 3 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
uh definitely	6 6	6 6
is what im im doing	6 3 1 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
well i mean i mean i do do really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 4
im im still a student	3 1 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6
many laws but little justice	2 4 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
there are areas where we could uh	6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i think you can	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what theyre theyre doing	6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 3 1 6
um codes and and and stuff	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
but also like you said	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4
and and it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that the card fee	3 1 2 4 6	3 1 2 4 4
theyre theyre great	3 1 6	3 1 6
i think that sounds great	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
i mean it it nice when you have a piece that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
you do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
but ive ive never actually been there	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
it it kind of it it kind of laughter-disappointing	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 3 1 6 2 4
i see that as being	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
these are well fed	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
the major	2 4	3 6
for example um	6 6 6	6 6 6
might do	2 4	6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
they they drove up	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and a lot of people go by their uh	6 7 5 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i- i think im im kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
so i think i think it it a good idea	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and i can uh relate to that uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
but i did exceeding well	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
well im im a ranger fan simply because1 i live here	6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and theyre theyre not always the best person for the job	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
so that that another example of the invasion because of a nonsolicited-	6 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
gosh it sounds so close	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
that that the thing	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
before they can	6 3 6	6 6 6
it was about a year ago	6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 2 4 4
but ive ive gotten to the point where	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
a stray	2 4	6 6
but this is something to me that that sad	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6
it you know	3 6 6	6 6 6
and i never felt	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let	6 3 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
you know how they can do some of the tests-	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
laughter-you laughter-know	6 6	6 6
trying to be	6 6 6	6 6 6
somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 4 4 4
because they have the ambition i guess	6 3 6 7 5 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
different uh a few different uh hybrid tea type	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6
our house in new mexico it was stucco	2 4 4 4 4 3 6 7	3 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
a lot	7 5	6 6
the argument	7 5	6 6
and if youre youre pronounced cured	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
and i am i am afraid to go down there because1	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and you get up there	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
hold on here	6 6 6	6 6 6
and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that theyre theyre	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4
so itll itll go up	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
the other fifty	2 4 4	6 6 6
it it gets bad	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
what can i hide and what do i have to tell	3 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i think everybody does	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
first house	2 4	6 6
uh the biggest	2 4 4	6 6 6
youve youve got it	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
i also have a good languages background linguistics	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and there there been a lot made in the local papers of that fact	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
you know to see different things that we could come up with	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
that that about right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and nothing nothing being done about it	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that was good	3 6 6	6 6 6
whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce	6 2 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
what what even worse	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i i think i agree with that	6 3 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
you know they they understood that the principles of the country were	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 3 1 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
the big white	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
really probably they could they could uh	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you still have a view that the american voter is different from other voters	3 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 4
a supervisor maybe anonymously or something	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and ive ive kept it	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
because1 they do not take the heat here	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i got up	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
and two thousand and ten and grant takes command and the war in the laughter-year	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 6 2 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
so there there always this feeling of	6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and then she grew to be pretty big you know like a pound or something	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
you know do do do do have capital punishment	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
uh working cleaning up the	6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
we i	6 3	6 6
i mean you know weve weve never caught up	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
with the suits and uh white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 6 6 6 3 7 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
jimi hendrix was the original	2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
you will be in prison for the rest of your life	3 6 6 6 2 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
time for it	2 6 3	6 3 6
well i went to school at west virginia university	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
one morning	2 4	6 6
and then you take it back to the store	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh public that you do do know about	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
something happen	3 6	6 6
but see theyre theyre trying to find an excuse not to deal with what	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
um then it really does does give you any indication	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i think that that just the biggest problem is keeping it in	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 4
i just i just	6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
she she uh fiscally she she pretty tight	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6
and i mean theyre theyre really super	6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
ive ive been there before	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
you know to have the you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
yeah um	6 6	6 6
and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the	6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6
maybe it should maybe it should be	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
have you served on a jury	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
the uh the	6 6 6	6 6 6
and and so they did did really go through the child care route	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but um there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there you know left to do that	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
got another one	6 2 4	6 6 6
and they tend to view	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
i think id id probably do it	3 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and and that is is fascinating to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
he says itll itll probably be gone in a day	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4
it was one of these fish that i- it	3 6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but it it got a like a whole bunch of people singing	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 3 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
and i think it	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
it it a statistic that has to do with	3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
my wife got them from uh	2 4 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 4
and they have	6 2 6	6 6 6
because you can get	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
they all have a pretty good reputation	2 7 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
are all double	6 6 2	6 6 6
well he put	6 3 6	6 6 6
did he did he hook up the wire wiring wrong	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
im im leaving the big city mom	2 4 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
uh the first time we went out there was uh	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i was reading just recently where the typical	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and a newspaper if i have time	6 7 5 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i think youre youre right there	3 6 3 1 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6
and with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries	6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
were were gonna gonna be involved in our child child education	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2	3 6 3 1 2 4 6 4 6 4 6
but ive ive got to go stop and go traffic and everything	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
i can i can actually work on that engine	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
i bought	3 6	6 6
well the you know nursery men will sell- will sell you things here	6 2 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 2 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know	6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
and three bucks- three- you know four bucks now to get in	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
and uh and you know but half the time they seem to	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
and uh it was just kind of funny because	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
seven twenty	2 4	6 6
well it it really bad that you have to be you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and then progressively through the week ill ill ill ill	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
it it uh right below virginia	3 1 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 4
but on the other hand there there a lot of advantages to it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6
well see we were under	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
what theyd theyd have to do to	3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i i really enjoyed it	6 3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
say if you change jobs	6 6 3 6 2	6 6 2 4 4
then you know that was it	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
situation youre youre in	2 3 1 2	6 3 1 6
yeah- yeah	6 6	6 6
we we see	6 3 6	6 6 6
probably there there easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 2 4
well we	6 6	6 3
well that that probably influenced maybe a little bit	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
price is as reasonable as renting a video	2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
three i think that i know of	7 3 2 3 1 2 4	6 3 4 6 2 4 4
i- i guess i should have specified	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
you know people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods	6 6 2 6 7 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
i like breeze	3 6 2	6 6 6
it was	3 6	6 6
but i do do even know their names	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
that go on and that they just have hopeless lives	3 7 5 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months four months ago	2 4 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
said my mom mom making me get rid of the bird	6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and trees help so that uh	6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6
keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
but at at evening	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 4
kids now that	2 4 3	6 6 6
and theyve theyve got a fifteen year old that that their boss that is carrying a gun	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
they do do have be totally roaring drunk	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
im im a sophomore	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
and everything else	2 3 2	6 6 6
but it was in	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that good	3 1 6	3 1 6
i guess freedoms or expressions of freedom	3 2 4 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
im im sorry	3 1 6	3 1 6
so um	6 6	6 6
but is is that is is that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and hispanics and other minorities just do do vote	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4 4 3 4 6
uh to keep these guys	6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 4
it it okay	6 6 6	3 1 6
and i was so mad	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and the whole idea was	6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 4 6
a touch of experience	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
do you read	6 3 6	6 6 6
did you crack the block or what	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
it was too bad	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
do you do you have children	6 6 6 3 6 7	6 6 6 6 2 4
you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them and ask for their information	3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 4
i see so many times kids just	3 6 2 4 4 4 6	3 6 6 2 4 4 4
but i do do think they could cover everything that you could	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
i know what you mean	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4
the old people	7 5 5	6 6 6
they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around	3 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
movement you laughter-know	2 6 6	6 6 6
i have have ever really looked at them	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
well i was i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 2 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 4
but i have enjoyed the conversation	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
and youve youve got a lot of federal money too	6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties	7 2 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
so when you turn in the cans unsmashed youre youre just like reimbursed	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 4 4
plan on those being shot	6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
theyre theyre not so	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
laughter-because1 it was assembled in canada	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 4
course there there	6 6 6	6 6 6
you just do do see cars like that	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so i guess youre youre better off laughter-sitting laughter-behind laughter-a laughter-bus than a car although i can never	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
and then you think	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
like we said before they do do have enough room in the jails um you know there there a lot of incentive for	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
and i	6 6	6 3
laughter-that laughter-that laughter-true	3 1 6	3 1 6
somebody else is messing it up well then that that their problem	3 2 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4
error though be it not the right way to do it	7 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
was planning on marketing a uh	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 3
it it kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 4 4
and there was	6 6 6	6 6 6
and if privacy is something	6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 4
but until that laughter-time	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you run obviously	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
have a friend that uh has	6 7 5 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
that grudge attitude that many have	7 5 5 3 2 7	6 6 6 6 4 6
did you have carpets and stuff	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here	2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6
diesel is burned it it it	2 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 3 1 6
uh something else along those lines	6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
that that typical bureaucracy though	3 1 7 5 6	3 1 6 6 6
police chief of the town	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
maybe they will if up further north	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i remember	3 6	6 6
and that is not emphasized	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
and we have a	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
i see	3 6	6 6
uh airplanes	2 4	6 6
total almost total silence	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
but it it not a a structured sort of thing	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
being told what to do is worse	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
as do	6 6	6 6
oh i bet youre youre glad	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
there is	6 6	6 6
is is the	6 6 6	3 1 6
but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4
i get married in a couple of weeks	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
and a used cadillac about three or four years old	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
texas is too	2 6 6	6 6 6
i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh	6 6 3 2 4 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
and i was listening to npr npr npr the national public radio	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
i was an engineer with uh	3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
and theyre theyre still convicted of of a crime that that deserving of	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6
i i usually get it started for my wife	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
and i think well what if somebody somebody dumped something back there in the	6 3 6 6 7 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 3
that that scary because	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i dont- dont-	3 6 6	6 6 6
um id i think it it it it voluntary	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
you know all kind of thing	6 7 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
when were were paying all these welfare recipients	7 3 1 7 3 1 1 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is	3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
you know george bush who who who the main owner of the	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 7 5 5 2 3	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
i mean people that may have been close to the edge just go over because1 they see something or read something	6 6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
you got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 3
go with something smaller	6 6 3 2	6 3 4 4
my got my mom a teacup	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
if nothing else	6 3 2	6 6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
uh if you enter any type of contest or anything	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
the guy the guy that played in it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
excuse me go ahead	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3
it it on at four	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 4
for uh	6 6	6 6
i mean i could could give an accurate	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
people are going whoa	2 6 6 6	6 3 4 4
i i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
i wish i could do that	3 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
judeo-christian ethic	3 1	6 6
it just it-	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that usually the way it is	3 1 6 2 4 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
uh uh to the degree that they thought it	2 4 4 7 5 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
in raleigh	7 3	6 6
thousand miles on it	7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6
i think youre youre right	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
so much with the prison system	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
and he got a demo	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4
danny glover	2 4	6 6
but i live in pensacola florida	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 4
but the the way they behave	6 6 7 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean it it better than it used to be	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
and the children are left without	6 7 5 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4
and stuff- so they just market them1	6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
well i guess	6 6 6	6 6 6
but you can	6 3 6	6 6 6
in the	6 6	6 3
unless i happen to go on vacation	6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
it- on the two story part and then on the back	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
you know things that would come up at work	6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that are are almost uncontrollable	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
and these kids were more foul	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
and it it it it just marvelous	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
im im	3 1	3 1
you know	6 6	6 6
my next door neighbor when i was growing up worked for the unemployment division	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and they were talking about selling the dmv dmv dmv lists	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 4 4 4
but supposedly they have	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i mean there there no doubt	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
weve weve tried it before	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
not a you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 3 2 3 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
it is a lot of repeat crime	3 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
and it uh rather bothers me that uh	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you just get used to weather	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
he he been overseas	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
now the	6 6	6 6
the case was reopened	3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6
um she she had them for a couple years	6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
a lot of a lot of people did	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
i i guess what bothers me is is that when you go	6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
but um i like a lot uh	6 6 3 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
now i do do know how	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
so i am kind of at this point	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside	7 5 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4
and this candidate tells you some things	6 2 4 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
uh during the incidents where they were you know like they are are paying their their restaurant bills and theyre theyre bouncing checks all over the place	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 7 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
now we have a kid	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
they came out with a european racing	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but then when youre youre when youre youre picked	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6
i have i have my doubts you know	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 4
need that shock effect where they equate	6 7 5 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
like you said i mean	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well of	6 6	6 6
one year	2 4	6 6
so what made you decide to put her in a montessori school	6 7 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
or you know if you want to be comfortable and casual you can	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4
being used	6 6	6 6
but uh there there you know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
but it it going to be a lot of work	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because1 of their low quality schooling	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4

been raised in one you know	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i think the elementary school teachers	3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 4
kind of an extra buffer	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4

i could could help myself	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
because i remember my brother he came home	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 7 5 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4

uh train engineers	6 7 5	6 6 6
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
to meet these people	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6

my husband does that	2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6
fairly solid- solid scientific ground	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 4 4 4
or sixty	2 4	6 6

get something out of that money	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
well i guarantee you youd youd be paying a lot more in taxes if- if uh the democrats had	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 6

extracurricular sports activities or something like oh were kind of traditionally the school school roles	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4

i mean even- even the greedy kids that weve weve got now	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 3 1 6 6
threaten my life	6 2 4	6 6 6
i do do know what they wanted laughter-i	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh were were getting value for it	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 4 6 3

you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff	3 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 6
and it	6 6	6 3
theyre theyre sociopathic	3 1 6	3 1 6
it was an acceptable social behavior	3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 4
well i guess mainly because um	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything	6 3 6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
the birds you it it hard to keep them1 from squawking or whatever	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i agree	3 6	6 6
nobody could figure it out	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
civilian conservation corps	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh bureaucracies wed wed get into and expense	7 5 3 1 6 6 6 7	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
percent of their gross income in taxes	2 4 4 4 4 6 3	6 3 4 6 4 6 4
they are probably going to miss the person	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4
youre youre just as blessed probably more	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
which indeed it really is	3 2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
well you know uh uh other	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
so the cost of it is higher	6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
either the radio or the tvs tvs tvs got to be on	2 7 5 2 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
but when it comes to uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
they want i mean if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well im im in texas	6 3 1 6 2	6 3 6 6 6
if i	6 3	6 6
you know beyond the suburbs you know	6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
it is uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
because that that like my daughter	6 3 1 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6
i guess kids do mature at different ages too	3 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
and then how many	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the	3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 7 5 6 6 2	3 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6
i we keep it the english system	6 3 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i just	3 6	6 6
as you get outside the dallas area	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
because um	6 6	6 6
we want to see	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6

a bit of	7 5 5	6 6 3
if someone is found guilty of a uh felony	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4
the egyptians would pull out	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
uh that that why it it filled the prisons up so much i think	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4
same sort of problem that happens sometimes with these some of these uh	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6

some of the stuff is good	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
so that was	6 3 6	6 6 6
and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4

and uh there there a lot of car thefts in that area	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yard- do something to beautify the school property	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 2 4 4
and sure it has	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
they did did pay any any attention to banks and	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
ill ill have to keep that in mind	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
you know unless they really make it rough on them1 that that not a	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and uh so i guess it these plants they just they do do	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6

does he get some royalties from that hopefully	6 3 6 7 5 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
everybody else	2 4	6 6
i thought that was the point of uh a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees	3 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 3 2	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
she she only nine months old	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6

i just-	3 6	6 6
that have been observed	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
you know i mean some topics	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed	2 4 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
rules if any	2 6 3	6 6 6
and i ca ca remember	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and im im in favor of keeping the the illegal guy from getting one in his hands	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 1 7 5 3 7 3 1	6 3 6 2 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 4
the devices of	7 5 5	3 6 6
youll youll hear one report	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
i think there there been like six or seven of them1 over the last like probably eight	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6
where baltimore is	6 3 6	6 6 6
there were several of them1 in north dallas	6 6 7 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
it- it- it is dark purply	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
say you go to a rock concert or or even a performance uh	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 6
well he does	6 3 6	6 6 6
they went back to her dorm room	2 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
i would say there has	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
when you when you if you if you teach them when theyre theyre little	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
if you take him to a home with a with private individual	6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
and that that	6 6 6	6 6 6
they call it something else	3 6 3 1 2	3 6 6 4 6
uh the houston astros	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
you call up their regular	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6

ive ive never even been called to jury duty	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
who to	3 6	6 6
it it a rotation	6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6
to be you know not to be crass about it but uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
you wanna wanna start	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
it just seems to me that only about uh from what i read only about ninety percent of the cases- only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre not really that bad	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
with petitions trying to get the judge	2 7 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it was hard	3 6 6	6 3 6
i laughter-mean	6 6	6 6
i can	6 6	6 6
late fifties	3 1	6 6
you know leery of the whole thing	6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
an advocate of	2 4 4	6 6 6
a lot more single moms	2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4
and i used to go up and visit her	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
so that you know that could work	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
that that crime that you ca ca fight it if you need that money	3 1 2 3 1 2 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4

uh i guess that should be taken into consideration as well	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
it shorted it out or something	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4

they do do have enough um	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4

and this boy really wanted to go on the beach	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4

i do do know what the solution to that is	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
and it	6 6	6 6
followed the tigers because	6 2 4 6	6 6 4 6

that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6

let let say compared to maryland	6 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 2 4 6 4

there are advantages to having	6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6
it it it it so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4

to break the flours down	2 4 3 1 2	3 6 2 4 6
and then lots of	2 4 7 2	6 6 4 6
and so im im used to sort of being	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
uh it it fairly	6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6
medium house	7 5	6 6
and they had took root right where they were on top of each other	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
such and such a date	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4
like buffalo who were were	2 3 1 2 4	6 6 3 6 6
they theyre theyre caught dead to rights	6 3 1 6 6 6 7	6 3 1 6 6 6 6

now she says that you know maybe when she she thirty she might want a child then	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 2 4 6
do you uh	6 3 6	6 6 6
and she still loves her to death	6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive had interesting conversations on several subjects not	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6

i had to have my uh radiator flushed	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
down you got to you got to have one	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i think if youre youre going into like uh law	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
i i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
enough of a vote out to to pass their plan	7 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 4 6 4
talk to you later	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but the ponds because theyve theyve had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
which is	3 2	6 6
and youre youre not supposed to eat those because1 theyre theyre bad for you	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
but still im im sure there are	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
into playful little	6 7 5	6 6 6
and the tanks came in and	6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
well i know both of my kids did did want to live anywhere around the	6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
there there there a lot of times though uh you get those calls and	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
more governors and i think you know roles like that	2 4 4 3 2 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
no that would just be a few	6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then i i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 6 6 4
and it it like eight hundred laughter-pages	6 3 1 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
um vice	7 2	6 6
that was that was really hard	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
i do do think this whole issue is settled as far as were were concerned	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 3 1 6
well i turned around and sold it myself for forty hundred	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
um jeff bridges and karen allen or nancy allen	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
he always uses it to	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
uh we have no basement	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
arcade was	2 6	6 6
are you able	6 3 6	6 6 6
and those jurors do do know about	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i recycle my newspapers and	3 6 2 4 7	6 6 6 4 6
like ponds that they had to filter it with	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
that- that that that really sad you know	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
ive ive	3 1	3 1
there there a lot of places that use human factors people	6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
probably another twenty years	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
quarter fifty cents whatever in a	2 4 4 3 6 7	6 6 4 6 6 6
in like the past several years	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4
course you know theyre theyre	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
take it to one of the uh	6 2 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
you know in the legal environment	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
do you really feel that sure about	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
well i guess i would	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and people who are on medication for example or	6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
and then you crawl over it and	6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
two parent	2 4	6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
laughter-you know on the other hand he voted for george bush	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4 6
oh well that that pretty good	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
are filled now in in garbage fills	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
they did	3 6	6 6
who knows what taking over mongolia or or something like that	7 6 7 6 6 2 7 5 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6
in fact i think that that	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
is uh	6 6	6 6
they just have have called me up yet	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think youd youd be more willing to either help that person or help it	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
it was just you know it was just plain	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
just easy to get them1 there and	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
we were living in	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but i do do	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
out before long it it gone	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
gardening and lawn care	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4
but it was a very	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
quite concerned	6 6	6 6
people suing people over	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
the bags behind them	2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6
the ears	7 5	3 6
or the plants do not make the winter time	6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
left him there for about a month and just decided i ca ca do this anymore	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 3 6 6 6 6 4
i think the program- you know that that one reason uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
but ive ive kind of gotten out of that	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too and	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6
and that um	6 3 6	6 6 6
and all of a sudden we had a bad	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
clean and	6 6	6 3
some drugs users behave	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
and uh and then to go to the trouble	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
breaks it down	2 3 2	6 6 6
we do do get a paper	2 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
and i mean it filled up my light fixtures because1 theyre theyre the old kind	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 2 4 4
because he he out there every day facing these people	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
but it still has to be a group of your peers	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4
strip east to west eastern part	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 4
it it suppose to be a huge stadium	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
usually takes long	6 6 2	6 6 6
and walked and i looked down both directions of the alley	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
and i think	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh i mean it it	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
uh uh i tend to agree with you uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4
and so its its better for us if it has has been just totally wet before we laughter-go	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
it it yeah it it it it like it it frantic to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 3 1 6 3 1 6 6
through the grapevine sometimes that there there been an earthquake or sliding or something	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
in texas law	6 6 6	6 6 6
off of the main highway	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
if theyre theyre out in the street at night it it it it really looked on as odd	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 6 2 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
the blowers	7 5	6 6
at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 3 2 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6
huh that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
i i was uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh the state state prisons were under a mandate	6 3 1 1 2 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i just like to have the tv tv on if you know if im im home alone or something	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
certainly intense about the cardinals	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
for some reason ive ive come up three times	6 2 4 3 1 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i was a linguist	3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
through the whole winter	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
uh perimeter bordering the house is all in	2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6
which i think is	3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6
you do do really have that	3 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
i think so too	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
thought through quite to the detail which you have	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
what what right is wrong	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4
she gave her no time in jail	3 6 3 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
your identification	2 4	6 6
how funny	6 6	6 6
if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
and the federal	6 7 5	6 6 6
well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in evenings my dog greets me at the door	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 3 1 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
my my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries	6 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 6 3 6 7 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
and always carry a sweater	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
you know in the summertime when it it really really hot	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i guess if that that all weve weve done	3 6 6 3 1 7 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6
also i mean there there hundreds- you know hundreds of people work for ti ti	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 4
when it when it came out	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4
get dressed again	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
and which- which was uh kind of stupid	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i would seriously question it	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 4 6 6
so i- i can see the advantage to that one	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
theyre theyre in college	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
one for just your normal trash	7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
purple buddy	3 1	6 6
that that causing the hole in the ozone	2 4 6 7 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh i- i should imagine that	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
and that that it	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
and you know if you can	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and and and it	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 7	6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 2 4 6 6
you see some of this stuff	6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
and they	6 3	6 6
they bloom in the spring	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
i thought it was funny	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
he thought it was too long	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
it it not all bad	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 2 6 4
let them1 try some innovative things and see what works and then	6 3 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
in such cases	6 2 4	6 6 6
i really enjoy that because1 it it kind of a	3 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6
it it just	6 6 6	3 1 6
but itll itll be hard for those that people have- have- have in school because1 they have to pay out even more	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
well not at the moment	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
and of course you know they tried to make the cop look out- like he was uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6
browbeat the jury a majority in the	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6
you do	3 6	6 6
who who in your family	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 4
and i my folks have always had	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 6 2 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and it was built in buffalo new york	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
how how old is your child	6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
and what does the foliage look like	6 7 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
four or five years	7 5 5 5	6 3 6 4
it is	3 6	6 6
than i do in the summer	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6
i remember when they first opened up	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 4 6
they just get out	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and uh it it	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
home school	3 1	6 6
well rome rome pretty laughter-small	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that was a very	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i cannot cannot	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
it it	6 6	3 1
and to have it located out in west virginia	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and apparently the rangers last year won a lot	6 6 3 1 2 4 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
maybe they run a lot of other tests	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
when we went and voted the next time i asked	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6
for two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment	2 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
and and i think that that where we as american people really failed	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i um i wish i i mean id id seen it when when you know it was originally in the theaters	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
you know i think if we	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
i guess so	3 6 6	6 6 6
i- i really think that um we spend a lot of time	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
data base	2 4	6 6
i maybe should have taken the higher grades because1 at least you can	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
but that that one thing to be said for credit it how it gets you some muscle where you need it	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3 2 3 7 5 5 3 7 3	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
are able to charge us like twenty and twenty percent interest	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
oh my it sounds like um	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
im im going to let you kind of lead the pack because you sound like youre youre	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
to bring them and take my garbage back out	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
from the	2 4	6 6
positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in	6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
there there such a there there such a difference through the year	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4
the best way	7 5 5	3 6 3
fifteen years	7 5	6 6
until they got in junior high school my youngest got in junior high i did did have to work	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 3 3 1 6 6 4
now not too many people have read that one i do do think	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6
do you get paid for these	6 3 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 4
and uh like the maltese falcon and all those uh	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
decided that	6 6	6 6
and and that it is a	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
that type of thing	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i guess we can end	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
getting in	6 6	6 6
that that correct	3 1 6	3 1 6
just citing that you know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
oh is that right	6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6
well at that time actually i had a volkswagen rabbit	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
but i should have	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
they were able to be home together	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and and- well it it gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
our criminal system is just so	2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
laughter-capital laughter-punishment	3 1	6 6
you know in a sense i do do	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
and i thought well gosh that must be pretty good	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
she just appeared	3 6 6	6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
go around all the places	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
the logic behind it	7 5 5 3	3 6 6 6
i like the	3 6 6	6 6 6
the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize europe	2 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and then they found it fried on laughter-the laughter-radiator laughter-behind	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
we were staying at the other end the island	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
i i should should say i do do know	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6
what do you think about the uh peace corps or public service commitment	7 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
it probably- it probably basically goes right back into the home- home though unfortunately	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
he shouldve he shouldve shouldve let them1 um	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
very little	7 5	6 6
do they car pool in	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and now it it running ten or fifteen minutes fast again	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
would object	6 6	6 6
well he went tumbling down the steps along with	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6
you can you can only build it in one place you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
i do do know about the young women	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and perhaps it it because somehow that implies to me it it not fun or something like that	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and it it it it like new	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
the concern for	2 4 4	6 6 6
well we go to maine every fall	6 3 6 6 2 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
not yet	6 6	6 6
id id like to try you know just try something new every year that i have have tried before	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 3 3 6 6 4 4
they have nice plans	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
um you know he would come home	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i personally i will i would take a person who who motivated and a little	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 2 4
but the you know the	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
i kind of	3 6 6	3 6 6
also i lived in georgia for about four years	6 3 6 6 2 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but theyre theyre trying	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
i enjoy	3 6	6 6
things went	2 6	6 6
and fifty percent of the population is minority	6 7 5 2 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 4
uh however i i do i do like a lot of different forms of music	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
and im im thinking	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and they got pretty scenery in ireland	6 3 6 7 5 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 6 4
and that place boy	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
you take pride in that and and	3 6 7 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 4 4
i mean theyre theyre theyre theyre totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
so apparently it was the same one that was on there	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well i i live in an apartment building	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and they they get off for good behavior	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm	6 3 6 6 2 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and uh that just kind of throws my whole schedule off when doing that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
and youre youre waiting and waiting and waiting	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
the da da da da office	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
i i do do believe in um	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh steel magnolias	6 2 4	6 6 6
very hard attitude to change	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i lived in germany	3 6 6 2	6 6 6 4
leaving you know in a legal way or something	2 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
i had the ceiling fan put up	3 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know or	6 6 6	6 6 6
and they did	6 3 6	6 6 6
oh you did	6 6 6	3 6 6
is it three or five	6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
the drunk driving has just actually just caught on	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the suburb im in is more of the upper middle class	6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i feel good after i do it	3 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
they you would would believe it though her kids	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and of course while im im doing it i feel pretty good	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
relax or or whatnot	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
and i do do understand sometimes the way	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3
but anyway	6 6	6 6
but i	6 6	6 3
plays the trumpet	6 2 4	6 6 6
like all the brass and everything	6 2 4 4 7 3	6 6 2 4 6 4
there there a couple of uh	6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 1 6 6
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
people speak	2 7	6 6
but i have the morals	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4
and the last i heard theyd theyd backed down from that idea	6 7 5 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
i mean it it not the	3 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 3 1 6 6
now you did did hear me say that	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
i think it it unfortunate uh	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
you know their	6 6 6	3 6 6
but they have	6 2 6	6 6 6
she um she had this uh book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 1 2 4 4
itd itd be like itd itd been like deactivated as far as uh	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 6
that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided	7 3 7 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
oh ill ill have less of a bug problem	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i have a few ideas of um	3 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 4 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
it was making the friends and going all the places	3 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4
and there was a lot of uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
order anything but the	6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6
because1 he said uh ive ive got	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
um and chopped up water chestnuts	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 3
are they	6 3	6 6
things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way	2 3 1 7 5 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
but no	6 6	6 6
one of my one of my friends here he was just talking how he he thinking on leaving the company and going to dallas	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
and so there there	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
you know where they could go from there	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6
might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6
to have a divorce	7 5 2 4	6 6 2 4
ill ill get out there and pull my weeds	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
oh it it just so many	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4
it it this is the way it it going to be	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and so that was two weeks i had missed	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but i ca ca imagine you ever making me that sure of something	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4
so a lot of the uh cars go to uh	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
theyve theyve had some terrible problems with hispanics	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 7	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
with scallops	6 6	6 6
and i have since then probably ripped out	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know	6 7	6 6
get a news magazine	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
from taxes	6 2	6 6
i mean im im going to raise mine the same way	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
to kill somebody is what it amounts to	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
im im not really	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
everybody had what they called there social year	3 6 3 2 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and then like the week before that they said go through your cupboards	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
well it should be given	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
in a room	7 5 5	6 6 6
i did did use to	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
more of it from a nationalistic	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
even from reagan it was all just like	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
in fact one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had	6 6 7 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 2 4 7	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
uh why why they could could do more recycling with those	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 4
were were not on city water	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
i just do do understand that	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
got up everything	6 6 3	6 6 6
i do do see anything like that to occur unless everybody	3 6 6 6 3 2 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
sixties or fifties i guess	2 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 4
to say that uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
strange book	2 4	6 6
watch them every day and keep them watered	6 3 7 5 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4
i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
and so it it not so hard	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i do do remember anything about dukakis	3 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
if you did did like beetlejuice youll youll probably wo wo like edward scissorhands	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
you do do have to live on the	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do think it it involved any longer with	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
then we have you know	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
got a bunch of groves in it	6 7 5 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i i think a good one was um	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
you know that that a good way to approach it	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
what is your name by the way	7 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and it it just going to be an accepted thing	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and it turned out to be kind of a joke	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
anyway my home is um	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 4 4 4
um youve youve probably seen him	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
stillwater is or	2 6 6	6 6 6
i do do understand that	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
i can see where that would would be very good for a	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 6
well how like how much is an oriole game	6 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and so you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and well the newer democracies	2 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 4
have a really good job	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
calling different places can really- really run you up a bill	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
it it um	6 6 6	3 1 6
stupid guys	2 4	6 6
im im glad i do do live in a big city	3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
north south east or west	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i i picked off like twenty of them	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
well of course	6 6 6	6 6 6
and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
im im just now meeting different populations like chinese students and things	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
how about1 you	6 6 3	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
at people	6 2	6 6
to give- to give you some perspective this this town that i	6 6 6 6 3 7 5 6 7 5 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6
and you could have them around long enough	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6
but if	6 6	6 6
so that is recognized as uh you know a place where women should be	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 7 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
it it	6 6	3 1
and uh i was a little disappointed in the third one	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6
i mean this is so so basic	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
it was a lot easier when i was when i was	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her laughter-you laughter-know	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 6 7 5 5 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 2 4
what is that called	7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
i do- i do	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
uh huh	6 6	6 6
they both have their place	2 7 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
so it was really too late to do much	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so when were were invited	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
but i mean he was	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i think a lot of it has to do with	6 3 6 7 5 2 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well you know why they actually held them1 off	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
so were were a little	6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
or i do do even want to get into it in the first place	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 4 4
uh i do- i i do do think the judge should just make the decision alone	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 3 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
act and and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what what going on in the class and disruptive	7 5 5 2 4 3 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
that that absolutely right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and one uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that that that that that bogus	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6
that that you know they sit in there and everything	2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
a wall will stop it pretty much	2 4 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 4 4
he gets on national television and and says that you know	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
you know being convicted is one thing you know	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
i mean i	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
the diesel engine	2 4 4	6 6 6
because if you follow this	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 4 6
so everybody could stay together	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
probably say that that	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
and one of the things that that they did for him they tested him	6 7 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6
so i did did vote because	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
put some good music on in there for her every once in a while	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6
my uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty	3 1 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
if should somebody be under the influence of drugs	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
he came with with his own rafter-	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 3
have have seemed to	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
they come in all different colors	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
ill ill have to tell my son about that	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
well who my husband husband parents were you know	7 3 2 4 4 4 7 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
whether- uh whether- whether get shot by	6 6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well now	6 6	6 6
in the bins	6 3 1	6 6 6
they were more for peace	3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
i think it it in canada theyre theyre using	3 6 6 6 6 2 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
this fellow fellow wife who was uh watching the dog probably- she i think she loved that dog more than i did	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4
oh thatll thatll be fun	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
some period of time	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6
all this that and the other	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
they usually are real basic	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
it it it it something that you can really talk about	6 6 3 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
that a lot of people	6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
ive ive um	6 6 6	3 1 6
you ca ca you know	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it might not be such a bad thing	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
might be worth it for peace of mind	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
but still	6 6	6 6
whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it it not even going to effect anybody but his uh you know himself and his own family perhaps	6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 2 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 2 3 7 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
so you know yeah	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
slow learners	7 5	6 6
so that that that that what matters	6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
you know it has pieces that are uplifting	6 6 3 6 2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
kind of stiffen them up a little bit	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
they just do do care	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6
another good example was i heard miles davis	2 4 4 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
of the effects	2 4 4	6 6 6
you know hack shops	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
and im im not an advocate for that particular	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you they they own you	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
miles each way	2 6 6	6 6 6
i- i can imagine	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
is that what you ended up going into	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
really now you know now this topic	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know you	6 6 3	6 6 6
ice and rain and everything	7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 4
like um	7 5	6 6
the farthest south ive ive been on the east coast is charlotte	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 2	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i mean not a whole lot	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
and yeah	6 6	6 6
and the parents send them1 there because theyre theyre supposed to	6 7 5 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6
or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it	2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 3 7 5 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
purple buddy	3 1	6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
in the first twelve months that i owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month	6 7 5 5 5 5 3 7 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 4
so she was uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
to uh to	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it	3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 6 4
the kid kid having to give up	3 1 1 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that that getting a little bit	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
just wanted to give him some medication to sort of	6 6 6 6 3 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
sitting home in your parlor	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
were were just above carmel	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6
but um of course i watch every saints game that i can watch	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6
it it pretty high alkaline- well-	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
and they dumped it all on the local school districts	6 3 6 3 7 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
in years past i know in fact even even the word drafter has changed	6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
i mean it	6 6 6	3 6 6
the prisoners make	2 4 6	6 6 6
the kids now	2 4 6	6 6 6
we you can pretty much wear whatever you want to	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know maybe	3 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6
forcing each other or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
most men do do walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it	2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
well you too	6 3 6	6 6 6
i mean they have um better	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
you messed it up	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
there there a lot of crime	6 6 7 5 2 7	3 1 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre smart	3 1 6	3 1 6
have you ever heard of george winston	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
to me i do do see any way of rehabilitating the guy	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
because of the way children are being raised theyre theyre not learning	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 4 4 3 1 6 6
but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 6
ive ive got a nice little business at home	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 2	3 1 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
when you do that then it becomes almost uh	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh than they ever would a man	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
so it would would	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
society society not going to put them to death	2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
basically that that it	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
so you have to	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
so did they get stuck	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
you got to you got to be your child child best friend i guess	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
consider considering a pool or anything like that	6 6 7 5 5 3 2 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
youre youre youre youre going to do that because you want to	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
if you fail	6 3 6	6 6 6
and at one point they did they took another vote on it	6 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
to expect of a person	7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
-depends on what issue youre youre talking about	6 6 7 5 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
she picked up the phone	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
is it what is what what the rule-	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
taking uh little girls right straight out of their beds at night and you know breaking in	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 6
im im going into thesis- or going into the uh	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
it- youre youre still circumventing it	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
and that we should support each other	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 6 4
she knows real well about um	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and youve youve lost your back yard	6 3 1 6 3 1 1	6 3 1 6 6 4 4
there were one case where uh	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
that that bad	3 1 6	3 1 6
the american public goes crazy	2 4 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 4
and i stiffen those with a	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
dinner party i would probably think of something else like um	2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
my husband had a uh	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
um also the worth of the hub of three airports	6 6 7 5 2 7 5 2 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
so you know theyre theyre not you worry- youre youre	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 3 6 6
i did did care about the program or anything else	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
ive ive not	3 1 6	3 1 6
and i- i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4
but it took them1 a little while	6 6 6 3 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
and you know i would would even look at another car	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
um they they feel	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
deep down i think every	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
uh adjourned	6 6	6 6
you people walk in out	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
it really does does	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i was in the super market this morning	3 6 6 3 1 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
invite the boss over and	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 4 4 6
but that that one good thing	6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
that is true	3 6 6	6 6 6
i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from dallas is	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 3 7 5 2 7	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
that that exactly it	6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6
or you ca ca get a deer license	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
wherever there are more	7 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
but i mean it in the back of my mind it always bothers me	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3
but um	6 6	6 6
now you watch	6 3 6	6 6 6
uh the c i a is moving out to west virginia	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and he said you can pretty much	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6
talk to their kids about school	6 6 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 4
that when they have inspectors coming they you know shut down everything and they clean up their act but on a normal basis	6 6 3 6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
and i believe that too because	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five	2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
even for	6 6	6 6
uh the uh	2 4 4	6 6 6
well one thing i miss is uh is the people from texas are are	6 7 5 3 7 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
i do do remember which other one it was	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
a victim	3 1	6 6

what they were going to say	7 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4
they were were i think they were early twenties	6 6 6 3 6 2 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4

all the other places	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that was all that was there	2 6 7 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and his son was failing gym and uh	6 3 1 6 6 7 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6
the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get get something in your hands	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4
well i know im im in the you know	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 1 2 4 6 6
because i know i certainly would would want to uh	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6
but but regard to benefits you know most companies have	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
hey youre youre required	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
dirty than anything you know	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and the boys were gone	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i do do usually have time to read the newspaper everyday	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but never did it	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
at work we started	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
to a private institution for the first two years	6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
the kids are are getting the attention that they need or	2 4 4 4 4 7 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
one of the unique things in this like a pound of ground beef	7 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
but it it the it it it it a reverse indicator	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4
what they were going to do and say	3 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and because of	6 6 6	6 6 6
and it is is because of the well	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
and you	6 3	6 6
i mean i would would stay in the um	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i heard like mixed reviews um of that	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
i was driving a lincoln a mark seven	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and uh the dealership i dealt with they order them1 all with the uh moon roof and uh	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 6 2 7 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
what is that safer soap uh b t spray this year	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
i could could tell my kids what you know	3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
and with that of course you know you have to pay them a accordingly	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
anybody caught talking in the english	3 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4
i think that that a good idea on your part	3 6 3 1 7 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
but it really is is	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
uh it it you know	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
some group paid part of his college	7 5 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there there enough	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 3 1 6
generally the uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
i figure if there there big big news ill ill hear it from my husband when he gets home or	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
and you know you know there was a law in	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and then i buy the bibs separate	6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the uh the jury that that trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel	6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
uh youre youre supposed to get five minutes	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
if you make homemade bread	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and you know i	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
but the point is is that businesses do that	6 7 5 6 6 6 2 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
but i do do think fossil fuels are the answer	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
what brand is it	7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6
usually sit out there	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean that- that that a sad thing to say	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 1
and and- it can be good for them too	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
in other words youve youve increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 6 6 6	3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
and she just turned five last month	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
they tend to like fry people left and right	3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
im im not getting any news magazines	3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
is there a problem that we should be aware of	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6
well um do a lot of people take advantage of it	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
our our kids love pickles	6 3 1 6 7	6 6 6 6 4
but has has it changed a lot over the years	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
much younger sister who listens to a	7 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 6

and uh it it one thing	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
it it great for mowing	6 6 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 6
i mean it it not so serious i guess until	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
but you know as soon as you	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
but you you be surprised also how much people watch you that even uh	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
other obvious things like that	2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6
i just oh	3 6 6	6 6 6
take me	6 3	6 6
i know this sounds like a slogan for the government	3 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
everyone come around and watch them	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 6 6
this ca ca be you know	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
just how	6 6	6 6

i have a sister that used to live in sevren	3 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
it would come right down to the end	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 4 6
and we we went up there to hopefully	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i laughter-probably-	3 6	6 6
it it terrible for us	6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
stop you	6 3	6 6
both parents to work while the kids are under seven	7 5 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4

at all	6 6	6 6
you know purely metric	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you ca ca arrest all of us	6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 1
illinois at one time	2 6 7 5	6 3 6 6
seven or something like that	2 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6
well so so that that another thing that has to adapt is you know the	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
not being in the	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6

ive ive only taken uh	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
self preservation more than theyre theyre actually looking after the good of the country	2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4

that that	3 1	3 1
this is a little bit of the subject	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
almost impossible	6 6	6 6
were were planning on moving to flower mound	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
beginning of	7 2	6 6
listens to their vote	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i was out there last weekend	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
lonesome cowboy or something	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6
but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 3
and they	6 3	6 6
and i got- i got it at a real good	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
it is over with	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 3 1 1	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6

she she big in the democratic party	3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
everything everything pretty expensive	2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6
see now	6 6	6 6
and it was late at night and scary and	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 2 4 4 4 6
as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
and they were just screening some candidates	6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
but um in many many cases	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
i was careful to keep her away from the	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
and it it just ten children at a time	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so i i i would really rather know	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4

our in uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
so it it a a complete	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
imagine the guilt that person would have	6 7 5 2 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 4 6 6
the only thing that was in it was built in the us us was the uh differential	2 4 4 3 2 4 3 2 4 4 3 1 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6 6 4 4

well that that good	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
uh to to future crime	7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 4
and you give him a license because he waited nine days	6 3 6 3 7 5 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 4 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
well i	6 6	6 6

three four weeks we have over a hundred	7 5 5 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4

and im im sure that the uh driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
it it it it your core education your general requirements- general education requirements	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
and i- i- i love to swim	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and they work at the same place i did	6 2 6 6 3 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
did did have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh	6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6
uh im im going to start this summer	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
a train	2 4	6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
i am wanting blue-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
if i was a cop id id be	6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 3 6 6
killed some people because1 he was uh smoking some marijuana	6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
you know it was this is how you hold it	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
pepsi cans and whatever laughter-up laughter-there	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6
bounce the first pitch off the ground	7 3 1 1 7 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that is crime where they videoed	3 6 2 6 2 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
a lot so many different songs	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
i think i sent in in money for	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
like you know the one over here on seventy skaggs	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
to see if when you make them available people then do do use them	2 4 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6
rather than the larger ones	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
well in a criminal case say one in which	6 6 2 4 4 4 7 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
boy scout troops or church groups or	2 4 4 4 7 5 2	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and we could could go get it sooner because1 i just had the baby	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman	3 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
initiated this random testing program	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
and you also get a lot of um	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
they were allowed to do hospital service or	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
and some of them require me to go out of town	6 7 2 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
in fact my dad recently got a um	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and sometimes-	6 6	6 6
so i went ahead and	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
but he he done well	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
flying missions into you know for whatever reason into uh	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
never been involved with them	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
do do let him go away	6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4
the student teacher improve very much	3 1 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
well uh the police force for one	6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and you just sit down	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i mean i like you know i like costner	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	3 6 2 4 6 3 6 1 6
you know if we do do want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 3 7 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
that that see that that an example of a right not a	6 6 6 3 1 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 4 6
ill ill try to remember that one	3 1 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 2 4 4 6
so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
you know they always offer	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
we hear so much about the violence and how it it not safe to walk the streets because somebody	3 6 7 5 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
realizing that that probably not going to be possible	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6
and the matinee starts before i can get away from work	6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i guess it it right in certain cases	3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
of course were were not we ca ca	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
do do do do	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i im im not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
and i suppose that that maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
now a days	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh number one is i im im im im kind of	6 7 5 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
problems they had in the past	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6
are you still there	6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6

i was hoping he was going to get best actor	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about	7 5 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 4
this is a uh	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
gordon lightfoot	2 4	6 6
and i laughter-really	6 6 6	6 3 6
i do do know what the answer is	3 6 6 6 3 7 5 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i see	3 6	6 6
the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
you get the impression that	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
had themselves a ball for about an hour	6 3 2 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4
in like a classroom or a day care center	2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre	6 6	3 1
it it it giving some people	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
that seems to be true	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and on the cover of time magazine	6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
well ive ive had a hard time enjoying harrison ford in anything since the indiana jones movies	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
she really has no idea	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
a large agency like that and for almost any agency	7 5 5 5 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
parks and rec building	7 5 5 5	6 3 6 4
i am into that	3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
for me i just	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6

he may never	3 6 6	6 6 6
i mean it it pleasant you know music	6 6 3 1 2 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
voting and with non	3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6

petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth	7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
and um so you sit there	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
so see there there they would have a doubt about you	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
well one of the things that uh	6 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4

and and ive ive seen the same thing that youre youre talking about uh	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4
oh it was great	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
in the last few years just his	6 2 4 4 4 6 2	6 3 6 6 4 4 4
graduated from my high school	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
which uh	2 4	6 6

that way you ca ca feel like somebody somebody out to get me	2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
number of people are are working	7 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6
that was before the uh uh they adopted the death law again	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
did we did- what-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
more now	2 4	6 6
i remember	3 6	6 6
ive ive got carrots i mean yes ive ive got a few carrots up	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
does a parody of the character he played in the godfather	6 7 5 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
it did	3 6	6 6
well how about having a jury- jury and a judge work together on it somehow	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 2 4
i agree	3 6	6 6
of being winnowed out	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
well i we were we uh we just started we lived in redwood city when we were out there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6
and she she been a lot of company	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh they have	6 3 6	6 6 6
uh to all new entrants all new applicants- applicants coming into government	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
a few big stories	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and then taking	6 6 6	6 6 6
and educating uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
like paul simon-	6 2 4	6 6 6
but the dogs are	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
and he traded the other one in and got this one	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
because were were in the metroplex	7 3 1 7 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be taken- uh done	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
it it just appalls me that they can be out	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i mean	3 6	6 6
the fact that that it it it it a better established and that the the city is is is more of a	7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4
and youre youre not doing your job	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
she makes six different meals	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
you know teaching him commands and stuff	6 2 4 3 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
before that i really did did pay any attention at all	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4
i suppose you know if you just make sure your car is	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh wonderful	6 6	6 6
so there is a base up here	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
go ahead	6 6	6 6
weve weve got about	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and i mean theyre theyre the first ones that take the brunt of everything	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 3 2 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but i do do know whether theyll theyll be far enough up where they can do any good	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
bought a mitsubishi mirage here a couple years ago	6 2 4 4 6 7 5 2 6	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
i do do have a problem with them	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
do you think the program came first or the	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 3
alternates to uh ama ama ama approved medicine	2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
not in my laughter-family	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
spend a day and a lot of money	6 2 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6
and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
how about	6 6	6 6
even people who might be of the gay community	7 2 3 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
and then he got hit by a cadillac	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then i would feel	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
it it the first and only time ive ive	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class	6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
maybe not in a in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
and i do not know if that that i mean that that it it a militaristic point of view i guess you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 3 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
so what was the verdict	6 7 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
and with that type	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
and- and go	6 6 6	6 6 6
you miss the whole thing	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
that way i did did think you- you know the house would be you- you know cleaned or anything for me specifically	2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
i- i think weve weve	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
you can find a lot of good public schools if you	3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
so they work on that job	6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
next year she she going to be five six years old in kindergarten	2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
obviously we do do have any	6 2 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6
i think the the gun clubs serve a useful purpose	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
ill bet you it is a dutch iris	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
but i think it it uh	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
but it it pretty effective in that you know youve youve got to get along in the community	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
we got married right out of high school	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
like if they did have a big brother big sister program	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
and he keeps saying oh no	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
golly gee you know youve youve got to be able to walk in the door	7 5 6 7 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
and it is right	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
my husband husband built a walkway across	3 1 1 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 4 6
i know some friends who went to see it	3 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
ahead of them that probably never serve and and to each succeeding generation	7 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
oh boy	6 6	6 6
and i screw around and do do do it or wait too long or something	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
and you know that that gonna gonna that that gonna gonna affect the people that are having kids in school of course	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
number of women in the work force	7 2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
weve weve flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
is for demographic	6 6 7	6 6 6
and it it about eight dollars a month	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i do do i do do uh	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
and we do do i do do believe we have as much as my parents did	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
well ill ill tell you another thing too now	6 3 1 6 3 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
like um	2 4	6 6
laughter-how we got together i do do know	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6
overdone overdone something	6 6 3	3 1 6
like everything else	6 3 2	6 6 6
so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
that that a nice little town actually frederick um	3 1 1 1 1 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
support the church instead	6 2 4 6	6 6 4 4
he ca ca hear me	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
probably some of them did	6 7 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
unfortunately there are often these correlations that are	6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
im im glad to hear that	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
and you press like one for yes and two for no	6 3 6 6 7 6 7 6 7 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that stuff we never even thought about three years ago	3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
nice talking to you too	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
i believe- something like sixty	3 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
up here some of the state parks are really nice	6 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy	3 1 6 6 6 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4
so i got it right out of college	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
i said you know it does does matter if	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
it puts you a hole in your money bag	3 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
you know for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
we just moved to a new house- into a house	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
well have we spent our at least five minutes	6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
oh well can you go to so	6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
but i think that	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
how do you feel about uh	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
it is	6 6	6 6
the oil leaks	2 4 6	6 6 6
i mean it it good because	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
you know where saint joe is	3 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
once it gets over seventy seventy degrees that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6
for road repairs	2 7 5	6 6 6
i i enjoy them	6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6
um in the punishment phase	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
a greater one	2 4 4	3 6 6
do you have any pets	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
in sending my sister	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
how old	6 6	6 6
what was your degree in	7 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6
i can trust him	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
you know if you do do	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6
so that that yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6
they ca ca even afford to take off you know to	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and where as	6 6 2	6 6 6
their uh existence in that neighborhood	2 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
and i was real upset	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
work on that	6 6 2	6 6 6
you can find out so much easier that way than try to locate it you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
but on the other hand	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
he pretty much confessed to it	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 3
because it makes a bigger problem	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
that that	6 6	3 1
which is something different um	3 2 3 2 4	6 3 4 4 6
you know the guy gets out in two months	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
then are you- can can you be helped laughter-you laughter-know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 4 6 3
i want to see it	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
because back then i was walking back and forth to	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well that that nice	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
well i guess that that uh	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 1 6
so i was reading the book	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
he was	6 6	6 6
there there a a real name for that like the judean law or something like that	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 3 2 3	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not	2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
need to teach their kids what not to what to do and what not to do	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 4
you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season	6 7 5 5 5 5 2 7 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
whether maybe through a commitment of the pta pta pta	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 3 1 4
so maybe i will	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
when i was uh married	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and my son was exactly the same way that i was	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that was it it a really nice area	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
you know be there at every beck and call	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
do you	6 3	6 6
this is quite a laughter-quite a long distance	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 4 6 6 6 4
and if you look at history at all you see that you know	6 6 3 6 6 7 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 6 6
that we hear all the time is how you bring them1 up	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 2 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
and a lot of them1 are going back there	6 7 5 2 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
uh and i i guess i i ca ca see that as being something to really object to	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
my parents live in boston	2 4 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4
the aerobics	3 1	6 6
real sure there are	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and he was treated like he had five fathers or something	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
bands together to do that	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4
and the uh the male instincts i guess or something about uh	2 4 4 7 5 5 3 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6
ive ive um	6 6 6	3 1 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
but i was out of the country	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
each attorney can use that as much as they like	2 4 6 6 3 7 5 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
in some ways i do do like it because it it like youre youre playing god	6 7 5 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6
it it a	3 1 2	3 1 6
you know	6 6	6 6
that that really good	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and they still	6 3 6	6 3 6
naw i guess that would be a good idea	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and it it called a user boards	6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
were were out of the service now	3 1 6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
it it just thing	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
utilities and so forth	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and i ended up getting you know basically something that i could	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
recycling trash	2 4	6 6
it it less expensive	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
so i do do get any overtime or anything like that	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know you would would have this uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i just could could get over the fact that reagan beat him	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
especially you know in the case of murder	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
so um	6 6	6 6
and i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
that that unusual	3 1 6	3 1 6
were were getting uh	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
you see all these people yeah these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
are very understanding	6 6 6	6 6 6
what were were more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city	3 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
that that about right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
the the family unit unit just not going to even exist anymore	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean these games	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
im im clouding up right now	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
the big advent of that i believe because	7 5 5 2 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
well my sister sister involved in one also	6 2 4 4 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
um if the purchase was	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
pretty much telling people	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
and were were were were kind of experimenting right now	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
theyre theyre all real young	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
teachers did did seem to be	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
well what you can do is take your car payment	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
uh it it almost like theyll theyll spend as much as the	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
that that great	3 1 6	3 1 6
it really does	6 6 6	6 6 6
i think we learned too much	3 6 3 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
very much so	6 6 6	6 6 6

passionate good argument	7 5 5	6 6 6
i mean	6 2	6 6
you got to take them for walks	3 6 6 6 3 6 7	3 6 3 1 6 6 4
are soliciting you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and and that that	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
but i would think that	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
maybe again	6 6	6 6
got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 6

judge or jury	2 4 4	6 6 6
except quit laughter-smoking	2 4 4	6 6 6
developed- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 3 1 6 6

i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
have gotten out as much	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i said this is the most	3 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
i mean i do do	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
you know if there there some gauge	6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
as far as credit cards go	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
if you	6 3	6 3
areas in the houses the way theyre theyre constructed	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 1 6
and it it a lot cheaper	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
i think the demands demands gone uh down a little bit	3 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
but i think i got rid of the wrong one	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4

that that really good	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
there there saying oh well you know the the people ca ca afford it	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 3 1 6 6
you know they do do really	6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6
were were just so protected	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i mean they have	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
im im not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision	3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 7 5	3 1 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
it it a problem if those voting	3 1 2 4 6 3 2	3 1 2 4 6 4 4
you know that might be it	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i grew up around san antonio	3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
just loves dick- dick vitelle which not laughter-many people do	6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
we do do have	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
up here you got to wait till	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
programs like that you know	2 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but i think it it gone up to four- four dollars this year	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
i have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally	3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 3 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
um the top headlines are always a murder	6 2 4 4 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4
but for the	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
but uh really it it part of this compliance thing	6 6 6 3 1 7 2 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
you know why should we	6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
you could hardly wait	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
like to have	6 6 6	6 6 6
but then	6 6	6 6
you get ticketed if you do do do it right	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6
uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient	6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know and these were all the soviet	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh for the sneakers	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
oh i did did realize that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
have several	6 2	6 6
is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of	2 7 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
they went from eleven to fifteen hundred	3 6 6 2 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and it it the same way with	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and also	6 6	6 6
i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3
between uh	6 6	6 6
i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught christianity in japan	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 2 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
i think one of the positive things	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
even if it it at the top and it it a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 2 4 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
uh we had no regulation against it	6 3 6 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
uh being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
that uh	3 6	6 6
it it that that simple	6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 6
i do do think you have to register a shotgun	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 6 4
he felt that he really had an in	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and he he their head chauffeur is this funny as theyre theyre parking the cars the valet service	6 3 1 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4

it it interesting though um to meet different populations	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh i think the	6 3 6 6	6 3 4 4

and it it not a story of the civil war	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
going to do it	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
and that we should recognize that	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4
it it easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that yeah the death penalty penalty the way to go	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4

i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
not really concerned about	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6

have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms	6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and that that one of them	6 3 1 7 2 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
the one that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you would would have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
it was an easy decision	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
i think they do too	3 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i would would want to see it cut any more than that	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i have have gotten any calls in two weeks	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4

the first the first one	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6
accepted as an automatic um	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4
and i do do think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4

you can have it come on just early in the morning and and off by the you know by the time youre youre up and about	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4

im im not that familiar with their future	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
and it it uh really cool	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 4
now you youre youre youre youre from texas	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6

it does tend to	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well maybe they run	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6

waving the normal uh procedures	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 3
but because it	6 6 6	6 6 6

and well well probably-	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6

i looked in every day care there was in louisville	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 3	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 4

and theft and probably murder	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
do you know what i mean	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
to me	6 3	6 6
so i i to stay away from them1 except ive ive gotten real attached to this one	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4
it it kind of like a historical compendium	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
it is	6 6	6 6
nice to to you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
they have probably	3 6 6	6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know what theyve theyve what theyve theyve been reporting about in milwaukee	6 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4
uh refined test uh	2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6
mine too	3 6	6 6
which was was by my choice	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
couples with	7 5	6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
have all the money	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because	2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 4 6 2 4 4 4
and there are several- you know several larger	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
reconvicted for	6 6	6 6
i tend to agree with you with you know	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3
just for protecting myself	6 6 6 3	6 3 4 4
well theyre theyre trying	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
that would be nice	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
it it just real nice that way	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
in fact ive ive got family that still lives up there	6 6 3 1 6 7 3 7 5 5 5	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i know for a fact that the any kind of stuff that if you	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
it was kind of funny	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
i mean uh uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
so i mean they they did did have any power	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 4
but i mean	6 6 6	6 6 6
i do do think it it going to change very laughter-much	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
but as far as cars ive ive never	6 6 6 6 2 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
i mean some maybe	6 6 7 6	6 6 6 6
i think that needs to	3 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i really do do know that much about it	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was was in panama where where	3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 4
i dont- i forget	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and most of my things are	6 7 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
the rain for the past few weeks has been	2 4 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
actual nightly news	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that was an awful three years afterwards	6 2 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
about nine of them1	7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6
um one is that um if youre youre coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever	6 7 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 6 7 5 2 7 5 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 4 6 3 6 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i think that that great	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
i mean it will just in incapacitate them1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
but theyve theyve got a statistic-	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
but you do do have	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i mean i i i was raised on walt disney films you know	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
seems like usually	6 6 6	6 6 6
preference is to be in an office situation	2 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
does does	2 4	3 1
i did did realize that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
were were changing doing other kinds of things	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that a good idea	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 2 6 4
and then just like the glass bottles	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
all sorts of things uh in the schools uh	7 5 2 4 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
i guess the only	3 6 7 5	3 6 6 4
in accordance with that	2 7 5 3	6 6 6 6
and then there there a very large hispanic population there	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6
with no problem	6 7 5	6 6 6
what about you	7 6 3	6 6 6
state- it goes all through the state supreme court system before theyre theyre	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
of how bad	6 6 6	6 6 6
would be benefit me greatly	2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6
when it was just starting i heard	6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
that sounds great	3 6 6	6 6 6
here when we run out of places to put it	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4 6
you know it it not so bad on your car as	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and it it fascinating because i had always you know been raised on this you know emancimationemancipation proclamation with the civil war	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4
we have too many pets	2 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
difficult to stick with a budget during uh during school and so forth	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6
whereas you know if the soviet union wouldve wouldve	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
attachment to	7 5	6 6
it it right there	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
well you-	6 6	6 3
a male rat had been bought	2 4 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4
but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 3 1	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
anyone who does does vote it it fine with me as long as i can have their laughter-vote	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
that that the thing about baking	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
which is really	3 6 6	6 6 6
that is a privilege	3 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 1 2 4 2 4 6 6 4
think the nra nra nra has gone overboard the wrong way	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
could- good possibility that their facts were were fantasy	2 7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
see i have i have a tendency to	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
he knew it	3 6 3	6 6 3
the institution	2 4	6 6
he was young	3 6 6	3 6 6
sure before you convict somebody	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 2 4 4
i do do i do do really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
but i do now	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
that that neat	3 1 6	3 1 6
because my husband	6 2 4	6 6 6
i do do know twenty	6 2 4 4 7	6 3 6 6 6
i think the handgun	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
an invasion	2 4	6 6
if youve ever know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and and i quite frankly do do see anything wrong with it	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 3
whereas at the same time the uh	6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6
have they stopped that practice now	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 4 4
that type of thing	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4
you know a good i-	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i think im im going to do it this spring actually	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
were were going to try it again this year	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
forty to fifty foot tall	7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6
i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what ive ive heard	3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 2 4 4 3 4 6 4 4 6 6 3 1 6
and so it it really since it it counted you know it it really a lot of work	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
as many	6 6	6 6
i look back at it now	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
that was quite a	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
and the people that he got the akita from used to have cats	6 2 4 3 1 2 3 1 2 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
served nine years was it	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
then do they give you like	6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
they do do have the offense to uh	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
oh do do say that	6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
you know what they called hawks which is more	6 6 3 1 6 7 3 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
about1 uh private citizens selling uh weapons	6 6 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and then freeze them	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
their own lives and things and usually working	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
generally people	6 2	6 6
and in fact theyre theyre not	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
well i do do know what oklahoma oklahoma laws are	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i did did	3 6 6	3 6 6
and the way it is now it it not	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
they might be saving money	3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 4 4

there is no curb pick up of uh	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
all split	6 6	6 6
encourage them1 you know to to be active and everything in school	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
at some particular point	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
well now	6 6	6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
i have to	3 6 6	6 6 6
especially in you know if you take a a child that that from the	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6

you do do have to spend the big money	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
volunteer work for teachers	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
trial by jury certainly should be mandatory	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 4
i think that discover card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you	3 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 6

we rarely go in there except for to play chess	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
let let move this way let let move that way instead of me having to think about it so much	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
we talk about this a lot	2 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
that they could pass on more	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 4 4
perhaps the government	6 2 4	6 6 6
and the real sturdy	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
they like to play in them1	2 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6
then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 2 4
um and i	6 6 3	6 6 3

it has to be reinforced in the home	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
that that just it	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
the last two years i have done more theater	7 5 5 5 3 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
we we got the connection through a ti ti uh church member	6 3 6 7 5 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
in order for my kids to	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
and the things that are important to you	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4
she finally admitted you know she finally told me it it okay if you do do	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 3 1 6 6 3 6 4
were were down here at the bible belt are are we	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
i know that	3 6 3	6 6 6
you know i think im im just part of that- the new stuff that	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
and i do do	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
you really	3 6	6 6
no uh	6 6	6 6
him and wanted him	3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
he started in day care when he was eight weeks old	3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you might even find somebody somebody been reporting on you	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
because i mean there are some	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and that uh for buses	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4
i did did play	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
not really	6 6	6 6
a sign that they would put down at the end of your block	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and uh the kitchen is norm	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4
end up killing theirselves	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but that that been a republican government for the last ten years	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 4
a lot better than i did	6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
angry about this because they said why is my child	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
the further away i get the the uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
pennant last year	2 3 1	6 6 6
and there needs to be some	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
uh or clerks	2 4 4	6 6 6
like nine- anywhere from nine to twelve years old i think is what theyve theyve been	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
is that democratic	6 3 6	3 6 6
he has his in the kitchen	3 6 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
uh american history	6 2 4	6 6 6
and if so should uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 6
because weve weve got a lot more people now than we did then	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6
so that your mom does does have a job	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i i think that if they	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
let let burn him	6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6
there there	6 6	3 1
give an incentive	6 7 5	6 3 6
promised the best he could	6 7 5 3 7	6 3 6 6 4
we set a table up	3 6 7 5 6	3 6 2 4 6
and if it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and he was using his furrows charge card too	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
there there pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh	6 6 7 5 2 3 2 4 4 4 3 2	3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
all these all	7 5 5	6 6 6
the carpeting was already awful anyway	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
if they have to serve in the military too	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and patriots were so depressing this last year that	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
it does does matter	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
some people will still buy them you know	7 5 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and the whole bit	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
she she just going to be	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4
they did	3 6	6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
um weve weve got	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and uh they all seem to congregate in celinas not so much	6 6 3 7 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 4
well i guess though where i would have a problem with it	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
and there are cases when you do do want that to be the case	6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 7 5 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
it it just she wants to get into trouble	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories	6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
obtainable information is on any single person	7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise	3 1 1 1 1 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
and until we have to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
well that whole uh	6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6
and of course i was i was living alone at the time	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
he he uh he was two in december	6 6 6 3 6 7 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
uh a book made up	6 7 5 6 6	6 3 6 4 6
and literally i would would have done it with the scaffolds because	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
get one thing or another	6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
but uh everything should be started on the lower levels	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
nearly as frequent	6 6 6	6 6 6
and you know there there some kids that	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
that that a beautiful state	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 4
really fast moving uh	7 5 5 5	6 6 4 6
theyre theyre doing in salt lake is uh	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6
i mean in other words if the government	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
i thought i thought it was interesting that he was doing something-	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
uh bothers me about our system	2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
it had to be a genuine toyota uh	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
i mean there there	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
it it kind of it it kind of been a drought out there has has it uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
um people becoming interested in alternate	6 2 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do trust tv tv as much	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
like i did did know what the difference between dukakis and bush was	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6
everybody in the world will offer you a a	3 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6
um it seems like there was	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and then in the winter time it it jeans or	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
weve weve got a weve weve got a couple of different things uh places uh	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
when when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
which is really really sad	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i do do know how you combat that	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
well i tell you what	6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6
a person lives across the street from me	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 3	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
and im im not used to that either	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
and you know and it creeps up on you	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 4 6 2 4 6 6 3
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and then you save- you make the bread	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
um i only work part time	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
that that some of the things i think about it	3 1 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 3	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 3
uh and you do do read a lot of fiction you said	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 6	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6

theyve theyve got to have them there to be able to milk them	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6
i mean we have these initiatives state initiatives now	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6

it does does	3 6 6	6 6 6
shot or something like that you know	6 6 3 2 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6

it mandatory for for the	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre cutting it back now what twenty percent	3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh by the moment uh to either be too lenient or	2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
and it was really nice	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6

just within the last	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4
after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it it it it something	6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6
he was	3 6	6 6
discrepancies that other people people like myself might not pick up on	7 3 7 5 2 4 3 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
especially like	2 4	6 6
like the cottage industries	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
putting out	6 6	6 6
prohibit them	6 2	6 6
that that just since in the past say about	3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
recently for	6 6	6 6
i saw part of that	3 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6
but im im not a real avid camper	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
just the john q citizen out there on the street	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
how long have you been	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
because1 that that kind of selfish on my part	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre going to use it uh too frequently	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i i feel that everyone is	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6

oh that that wonderful	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
uh in the school system	6 6 3 1 1	6 6 2 4 4
still is an interesting story	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
it it like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4

men take out their frustrations by watching football	2 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
endanger someone	2 3	6 6

big places	2 4	6 6
and it is i would imagine in terms of	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
they were all everybody was trying to flee the campsite	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4

and you ca ca sing along either	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and so forth	6 6 6	6 6 6
it was wonderful	3 6 6	6 6 6
g e double l o	3 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6
cases of you know	2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6
i think i know a little more than i used to	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 3
or proposed- or is it proposed	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
we are are	3 6 6	6 6 6
the methods of	7 5 2	6 6 6
oh twenty uh seven	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
i mean maybe one snow	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
you know and i	6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6
i- i know i- i i know it is getting worse	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6
i mean it was amazing	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
that that okay	3 1 6	3 1 6
i come from a state that has	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 6 4
even despite you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
it is overcrowded because there there so much drug uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 4 6
and it it	6 3 1	6 6 6
but those are nice- germantown is a nice area	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
youre youre youre youre aware of that kind of thing	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
see the movies lately	6 2 4 6	6 2 4 4
supposed to be a great babysitter	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
but they do do do it	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
i have wondered why	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
if they need to do that as a condition for employment	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
very severe	6 6	6 6
and i was picking up uh some background noise	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
because uh were were just having conversation on this uh with a couple of people yesterday	6 6 7 5 6 6 7 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
oh i will	6 3 6	6 6 6
you you you	6 6 3	6 6 6
and that that hard	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
that that kind of how my husband and i are	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 7 3 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
all right	6 6	6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
when you go through uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
two days before his sentence was up	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it is	3 6	6 6
im im	3 1	3 1
he he identified the the people that have written certain songs	3 1 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
you know a talk show about sports books	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
the the books are kind of uh	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i mean-	6 3	6 6
i think those guys- those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
but it it just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 6
and theyre theyre more expensive of course	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
how about meryl streep	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
the the straight edge	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and she did did act like it bothered her at all oh	6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
you take care	3 6 2	6 6 6
it it probably	6 6 6	3 1 6
if the parents are are supplying it theyve theyve got to get it from someone else from the schools	6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 2 6 2 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
or a judge wapner like	2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
it would would be hard	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
if it if it it just one more piece of something	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 4
these two men	2 4 4	6 6 6
uh it it just so	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i guess that that an invasion of privacy	3 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4
well we have those um which i think is one of the best things is those	6 3 6 3 7 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4
uh now i happen to know several judges	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 6 6 4 4 4
and ca ca have what you want	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
those kids getting snatched	2 4 6 6	6 6 4 6
the credit limit	2 4 4	6 6 6
this was twenty years ago	3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 6
did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
really enjoyed it	6 6 3	6 6 6
crawl on me	6 6 3	6 6 3
and trying to rehabilitate him too	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
presents it to the to the jury	7 3 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4
looks like a mcdonald mcdonald commercial you know	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6
two weeks later i get another letter even nastier	2 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and i enjoy those	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion	6 3 1 1 6 7 2 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
well that	6 3	6 6
and it it kind of a weird feeling	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6
the united states intervening- intervening with patriot missiles	2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
with a lot of things that	7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6
songs that	2 3	6 6
and i think part of it is that theyve theyve got to give authority back to the local school	6 3 6 7 2 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
you know in a	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
treatment or you know	7 5 6 7	6 6 6 6
i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did	3 6 6 6 6 3 2 3 1 1 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh six- between six and eight six to eight weeks old	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh it	6 6	6 6
i id id like to see something like that	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
and during that week youre youre kind of an ad hoc	6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
that that very interesting	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
if there is some	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
increases each year does does it	6 7 5 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
i dont- dont-	3 6 6	3 6 6
i i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
i mean looking at it from the american- the american public public standpoints they do do understand the middle easterners	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 2 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i know the shiite are their people	3 6 2 4 6 2 4	3 6 2 4 6 6 4
like like i said at the beginning ive ive got so many connections with people in central america	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 2 7 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4
and it was for a murder trial	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 4
and she she almost housebroken	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and i put paper all over the floor	6 3 6 7 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i would would mind having oh more votes than i get to have frankly	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
i wish that	3 6 3	3 6 6
well is there enough money	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6
how many people are in	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i would say that that probably their prime motivation	3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
but again it it going to be the law abiding citizen that that going to comply with that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
and the first	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i ca ca wait until stuff like that starts happening	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
long enough to to bring in the big dollars	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
their success rate is very high	2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 3	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6
last year it was dc dc	3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
what uh	7 6	6 6
but uh like ten years ago	6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know millions of dollars a year for for what	6 6 7 2 4 7 5 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh back when i had my business i got one	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 7	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
does does seem fair to me	6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
so theyre theyre the last	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 6 4
i said	3 6	6 6
some of the schwarzenegger stuff	7 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
out here in california there there a program like that for uh juvenile delinquents	6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
worth our while to	6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6
it really	6 6	6 6
some of the northern	7 5 5 5	6 6 2 4
maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 2	6 3 6 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
or if your management does does think that	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 4 3 4 6 6
and you know as a teacher youre youre alert youre youre alert for the kid who who very drowsy	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know	6 7	6 6
the major cause of air pollution or at least in the boston areas	7 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 3 6 4 4
you borrowed somebody else else jack	6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
i can start doing it in the evening after work	3 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
idea for the young kids like that too is to have like a	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
well i mean yeah	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
have to pay them something	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
there there there there no	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
it depends um you know it depends on what-	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
i was just	3 6 6	6 6 6
and you talk about stress and pressure	6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i just made my first job hop about eight months ago	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
i did did pay for	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
and then he	6 6 6	6 6 6
and uh i was just absolutely shocked	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
or perhaps we have paid too much there	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i was just going to say i think one of the	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
it it just so well done	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
i just um	3 6 6	6 6 6
i mean there is a lot to learn	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
she had a dispute black girl	3 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i i like it i like it a little bit better too	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive never seen one	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6

that sounds good	3 6 6	6 6 6
and im im just	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
from dallas	7 2	6 6
you really do	3 6 6	6 6 6
advanced education is because down here	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
thered definitely have to be a major	6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i was just looking	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
oh no	6 6	6 6
and and when you find someone like that that you know	6 6 6 3 6 3 2 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
they enforce the death penalty for that	3 6 3 1 1 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and theyre theyre just kind of	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
it it got a hell of a kick to it	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
you know selecting-	6 2 4	6 6 6
least with the jury you have	6 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
should say	6 6	6 6
well i thought you work for t i	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
what else	7 2	6 6
so you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
most big organizations have	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
i youre youre talking about the person person already been	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
we used to do that um	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
and we um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
dress suits- suits like	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
downtown if you were to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
got violent- more violent every year	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6

you know checking with to see what	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
the government	2 4	6 6
good for you	6 6 3	6 6 6
you know to to	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and we found that uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
uh i live in dallas	6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4
even some of the immediate things that i need to know i do do know it until the next hour	7 5 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
industry pollution	2 4	6 6
where you know like one cow produces like	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
oh does she	6 6 3	6 6 6
he got out of it his unit right after panama	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
but i do do know if that that the case	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4
well see what they did was okay they uh they wrote to all the initial people you know the	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
and they they said that	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
we are to compare homes	2 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
well there there so many parents that say	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
we get the uh	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
what else	7 2	6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
that that exactly right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
you know as someone that has merit even if they are	6 6 6 3 1 2 7 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
you know is uh	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6

and im im really allergic to them1	6 3 1 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i guess it it the reflection of	3 6 3 1 7 5 2	6 6 3 1 2 4 6
that was good um	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i i do do see it just relegated to the young	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4

oh okay	6 6	6 6

that because this is uh between a company and an employee it is not	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
but they	6 2	6 6
i mean i do think that	6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
in a way it is	6 7 5 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
i agree with that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
visited around	6 6	6 6
may be more productive if youre youre comfortable with what your your wearing and can be be feel more relaxed	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
in graduate school working on my master master degree	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
whenever you say bright steps everybody goes oh ive ive heard that that the best day care in town you know	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
you know people get fired	6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and so to me that that	6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
you never heard about that	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
for you know their fall semester	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
you know once again those things are not that accurate	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so i mean it it it it kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
ive ive been over-	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
id id probably id id probably say about a five	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
the very next month	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
brought- brought up	6 6 6	6 6 6
a majority of the jury	2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 2 4
very conscious of of passive smoking	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
we would be ahead you know	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
so i	6 6	6 6
im im embarrassed to say the last	3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know almost the goodness of character	3 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 7	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
that got him a bonus of twenty	3 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
but realistically	6 6	6 6
being informed better	7 5 5	6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
so i finally just went to see it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and also you know you you feel more like you know youre youre actually part of the community if youve youve done something	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 4
crime problems that theyre theyre having there	7 5 3 1 1 7 5	6 6 3 3 1 6 6
who do you work for	7 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
not you know not like	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
i enjoy reading t news	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
and you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
and then they have	6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4
maybe theyve theyve changed their minds	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
who who their quarterback	7 5 2 4	3 1 6 6
but uh when i look at it to me uh it does does really make any difference	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 4 6 6 6 4

unless it just hangs there like in places where it it a lot of pollution	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 4

they got along	3 6 6	6 6 6
which i was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
armed you know felony record	2 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4

all right	6 6	6 6
hit around and	6 6 6	6 6 6
a total mess-	2 4 4	3 6 6
so that the children develop good learning patterns	6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
a lot	6 6	6 6
i guess the teachers will have to	3 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 6 6 4 6
i do do know that what they have	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6

decide you know which kind of uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
and down	6 6	6 6
and that that it	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6

and they said that he he you know great in electronics	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
convicting him on some of the charges	6 3 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and i i feel like it it really just within the united states	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6

oh um have you seen the gods must be crazy part two	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4

now now	6 6	6 6
once or twice just- just-	2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
if theyre theyre the kind of people that commit these	6 3 1 7 5 3 2 3 1 2	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
theyre theyre expensive	3 1 6	3 1 6

and uh my mom did did work at all when i was growing up	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
that was always kind of interesting	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
just like	6 6	6 6
if we ca ca send people to the moon that we ca ca improve these laughter-things	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
how do you feel about gun control	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
i do you have little kids or what	6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
how do you put trees in there	6 6 3 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
inside basketball court	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that that that uh	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
it was a really cute little kid too	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the ticket	6 6	6 6
i think so	3 6 6	3 6 6
and do them	6 6 3	6 6 6
i have people that want to go to dallas	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
burton burton kind of uh	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
it it interesting to see the the wider world	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i could just kick myself for even starting laughter-it	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but it it set back enough to	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and then the shells are in another part	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and it was like ninety	6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 4 6
so if you really computed it they probably	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i uh went to purdue for a couple of years	3 6 6 6 2 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6
itd itd probably be somewhere closer	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
that was a change	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
im saying teachers should be paid more	3 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it been a pleasure talking to you	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6
having cops there	2 4 4	6 6 6
do you live in a real small town or	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
that she needed uh the woman needed someone to babysit	3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4	6 3 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
that that the way they suck you in	3 1 2 4 3 2 3 2	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
is also a doctoral student down there	6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6
a a loss i- i think	7 5 5 6 3 6	6 3 4 6 6 6
and then youll youll	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
better safe than sorry	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
the um	6 6	6 6
im im married and have uh a couple of children	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
uh then what i usually do is i freeze them	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6
i think it it i think it only has about five or six more years to go	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
just walking	6 2	6 6
and i uh of	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i can imagine	3 6 6	6 6 6
im im convinced that	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
so much smoke in the air	2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
just uh	6 6	6 6
oh can you can you hold on for just a minute	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
im im	3 1	3 1
that the	6 6	6 6
but you happen to look laughter-the laughter-other way during the time	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
it was it was really amazing	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
is is motivated to do anything	2 4 4 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 4
maybe maybe if i went back and took a sociology	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6
and you know i could go along with that if if i could be assured	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
and but you know i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
a with a certain style	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
so laughter-id laughter-have	6 3 6	6 6 3
twelve person jury- jury	2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6
well there there there there probably two or three different types of of views as far as the controversy goes	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
and everybody- all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6

and she just loves it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
oh it is	6 3 6	6 6 6

but they like them around because they do all the menial labor	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
well up uh up in new england where im im from uh	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6

and and like iran iran the big bad guy you know	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
it was on one of the networks i think last weekend	3 6 6 7 2 4 4 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
two or three months go back to work	7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive decided	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know just a technician	7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4
we had some new people move into our building	3 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
pretty congested	6 6	6 6
job security	3 1	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
but i	6 6	6 6
and then the sauce is just made with um	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
you know using all these natural forms	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and they had to sit in there by themselves	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
some i do do	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
and she told me	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
to get motivated to do it	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
get- living just sixty miles north of them	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
so we had to sit there you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that i pressed it hard enough because1	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans	2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
uh they gave everybody a number	6 3 6 3 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 4
um uh human factors	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
so there there undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they are never going to let a a teacher spank a child again	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
i have have gotten really involved in anything	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
were were were were were were behind down here	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6

write to the schools themselves	6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6
i was going to say	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
then they had	6 3 6	6 6 6
it is comforting to me to see	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh well you sound busy	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
i mean did you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
or people can drop their used newspapers newspapers and other papers	6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4

well that that good to know	6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
and you think everyone should have it	6 3 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
with the drugs theyre theyre	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
be able to have a normal happy life	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
and you do that in the primary	6 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4

maybe we do we need some more catholic schools	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it would certainly be an interesting test	3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
got a pretty fair amount of snow	6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4

i ive ive i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
i- i- i- you know	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6

well uh i think she she mostly german shepherd	6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4

well ill ill	6 6 6	6 6 6
i think to begin with	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
god i hope i do do sound like a stage mother because right now if you ask my friends twenty- put twenty mothers in a room and ask them1 how many have gifted children	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 6 6 3 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 4 4
most of the time i hear myself saying well you know we do do have enough room left in the jails	7 2 4 4 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
it it stephen	6 6 7	3 1 6
starting to show that wear and tear now	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
um and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
occasionally ill ill see that one	6 3 1 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6
and um this was a nice sweet	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
topic because	7 6	6 6
and you know my heart was in my throat you know	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
because1 you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jury- the jury	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 6 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
i think it is too	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
i do do want to i do do want to deal with the	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and then i feel like i ca ca really complain too much unless	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
and she she been okay ever since	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
protestant congregations	2 4	6 6
you probably ca ca afford to eat if you have more than two of them	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
well do you think weve weve	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
might be acceptable	2 4 4	6 6 6
but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and	6 3 1 1 1 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6
the police drove up just as he fired the gun- gun and killed the guy	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4 2 4
i ca ca remember which	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
it would be great to have some of those	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and then some of the bigger companies	6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
in america if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
if if somebody somebody about to	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
so everything around here is	6 3 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh whether it it a pistol or a shotgun i suppose	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6	6 6 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
im im sorry	3 1 6	3 1 6
theyll theyll rob one house	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
at seventy	6 7	6 6
is if there is	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
born and raised in toledo	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
x number dollars for the recipients	2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and all i do is teach reading all day long	6 7 3 7 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
however probably not enough of them uh country wide	6 6 6 7 2 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that one reason we bought a house here in plano	3 1 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
it it once you get out of that habit you just do do	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
with with a puppy	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and i see armageddon up there	6 3 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
next thing you know	2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6
they will accept it in any condition	3 7 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh well what what there to say	6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
it it	6 6	6 6
ill ill watch that occasionally	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
and i think theyve theyve got a compcontainer uh some kind of	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
that that the only reason i have a problem with it when there there no	3 1 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6

that that a two hour drive	3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
then you can find out from you know you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these-	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 2 3 2 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
have you are you a civil war buff at all	6 6 6 3 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
id id take him up on that	3 1 6 3 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
but i do not	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time	6 6 6 6 6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
oh the worst kind	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
you do	3 6	6 6
almost- i mean she she that	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 1 6
my parents were	2 4 6	6 6 6
and it was like when our ancestors first came over	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
putting you in that	7 3 7 2	6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
the work	7 5	6 6
and it was it was just bedlam	6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
two or three you know	2 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
kids do do have a a	2 4 4 4 4 7	6 3 1 6 6 6
just about anywhere	6 6 6	6 6 6
which is similar to a stress management practice or	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
but then they went ahead and charged it on my account	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
makes good tv tv movies	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
did understand politics i probably would vote more	6 6 2 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
and it it it it interesting to notice when you go to different schools that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i mean it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
is one of the main problems	6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
my dad dad like that	2 4 4 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
but uh now my daughter has-	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
you know when i had them and when they were small	6 2 4 3 2 3 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
that that that that the way you got your education in this country	6 6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 1	3 1 6 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
sit there and wait for something exciting to happen	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6
and that that not really the answer i mean because1 if theyre theyre alcoholics theyll theyll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 7 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 4 6 4 6 6
i like uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
course they pay them	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
and she always told me it was because i was still growing	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
uh cycle pitchers	2 4 4	6 6 6
there been so much work done already	6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
we went to sixty per cent state funding to sixty per cent local funding in a matter of four years	3 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
do do know you know	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
for a while	6 7 5	6 6 6
his crime was just horrible	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
well uh could you give me an example of a case where you think that	6 6 6 3 6 3 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
probably warrants it	6 6 3	6 6 6
it it gonna gonna be too late	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
in a	6 2	6 6
or people getting somebody else else blood test	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 4 6 4
i mean well you eat them1 dead	6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
that that maybe the majority of the importance i guess	3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 6	3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4
tall buildings	7 5	6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
but im im going to school uh for legal assistant	6 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
and there was this	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
you uh had uh contributed x amount last year	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
well i i have a dog that god gave us too	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
and just as easy	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it just a hassle when you know to go up	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
if i consider going the used car route	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 2 4 4 6
i guess that that a risk you have to take	6 6 3 1 7 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 2 4
i did did know that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and so-	6 6	6 6
and things like that	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6
and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
then yeah do do eat it	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
more intellectually	6 6	6 6
but um i do do	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6
so when we get like uh	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6
boy i ca ca remember	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and all that stuff loads the	6 2 4 4 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6
to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 1	3 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6
during the depression or coming out of the depression	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive	2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean these- these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
some sometimes that that fine	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
you have to start somewhere	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 2 4 4
or not a table but a desk in this closet	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
i should imagine virginia from what i read uh uh	3 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
my garden is shaped that i can	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
i think that like you said television	3 6 6 6 3 6 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 4
i mean it it like theyre theyre turned off on voting	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i i agree	6 3 6	6 6 6
i said- asked him something about well did you who did you vote for for uh cheerleader	3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 7 2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
that that a good idea	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4
i- i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls and uh only because i	6 3 6 3 6 7 2 7 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 3
give me break	6 3 7	6 6 6
got them	6 6	6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
im im not a people person	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 6
to go to through college and etcetera	6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
well i guess that that good they got something to keep them active	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 4 3 2	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
you know so that	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
so ive ive never	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
i know we did in the military	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
well what do you believe in	6 7 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
my cats do that it if i throw anything away that that any kind of meat or anything like that	3 1 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 7 5 2 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6
it is	6 6	6 6
a lot of them have uh come around	7 5 2 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
you know the uh	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
stretched across the top of her body with with its	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
so i that that kind of my favorite	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
serving other people	6 2 4	6 6 6
and having trouble with a few other things	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in my class	6 2 4	6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
she says it it wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
oh that that so neat	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
sort of hat	7 2 4	6 6 6
we should commit to spend a week	3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
oh youre youre kidding	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
there was was a lot of the drugs and alcohol and	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
anyway but	6 6	6 6
then you can look at mitigating circumstances	6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
and they have a minor league team	6 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
id never got shot with either one	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
that that a cost of doing business	3 1 7 5 5 5 2	3 1 2 4 2 4 4
she does does work-	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in other words there needs to be um more than	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4
so that that all they work on	6 3 1 7 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
national ties	7 5	6 6
so much for the bird	7 5 5 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
they in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
and uh then she recouped	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4
that um	6 6	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
like i got battle cry of freedom you know like a couple of years ago	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
because1 i wish we would do more	6 3 6 2 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
uh no	6 6	6 6
uh were seeing that here as well	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and work on their college degrees	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
all over creation	6 6 2	6 3 6
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
forty degrees right now	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6
does it give um i guess little encapsulated reports and	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i do do know all that	6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
my i have my ninety year old mother living with us	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
because it it a situation	6 3 1 7 5	6 3 6 2 4
well and i think uh you touched on it you know	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh classified that can damage the earth	2 4 3 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and the public public	6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6
and you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
she looks gorgeous	3 6 6	6 6 6
you just you know you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know get the check and everything is is	6 7 5 3 1 7 3 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
although right now it it a lot lower	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
because i told him there there a place in arlington that that gonna gonna give it to me for that price	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and there was a lot of protest	6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 6 4
and that was	6 3 6	6 6 6
that that um that that been like that since they the first newspaper you know	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
uh was a what	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better	7 6 2 4 4 3 2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
the hardest part about uh	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
just walk you know confidently	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
i only	3 6	6 6
but again it it uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6
it it uh bermuda	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
on a statewide statewide basis or do do have as many kids just have to follow along and take what texas gets	2 3 1 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
aid to people	2 4 4	6 6 6
say three bedroom	6 2 4	6 6 6
let me tell you	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
i can be	3 6 6	6 6 6
it was it was real comfortable and	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and he drove it literally into the ground laughter-you laughter-know	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 4
um i do do see it as much the like in my situation where i do do i do do have children yet	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
oh is is	6 3 1	6 6 6
but theyd theyd treat him bad	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i think laughter-we i think we did pretty good	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and brando like	6 3 6	6 6 6
they have them you know in the	3 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and teach them how to do things like farm	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i i was was either	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
like to participate in uh things like	6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 2 4 4 6 4 4
uh we just got the the dog less than a year ago	6 2 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6
but boy he sure had trouble you know putting things on on paper	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
it just really grabs your attention	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and i guess-	6 3 6	6 6 6
history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera	7 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
it does does fit the circumstance anymore	3 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
well let let see	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
to complain about it	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3
and and ive ive ive ive heard recently	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
that that the hard part is cooking with uh kids around because uh	3 1 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i think the only- closest thing ive ive come to to a diesel is ive ive worked for	3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 3 1 6 6
i how	6 6	6 6
as a general statement i feel i	6 7 5 5 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
i could just walk in the door	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and let let uh let let throw the rascal in jail and stuff	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
you know	6 2	6 6
but im im	6 3 1	6 6 6
well this has been really interesting	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things	3 6 7 5 5 5 3 6 7 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
and fortunately voting is is that	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6
is that	6 6	6 6
there there no deterrent	6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6
i was wondering that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
i mean that it seems to me that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6

i get	3 6	6 6
i just remember sting was in it	3 6 6 2 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well world music is um	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 4 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
was it like the movie	6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 4
i mean i am willing to do it	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6
conclusively pointing to this individual	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 4 4
like drunk drivers that kill people	6 7 5 3 7 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
and kind of a couple of people they just	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
i mean i i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 4
there there there a guy	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6
i read it	3 6 3	3 6 6
i do not know if you listen to him or not	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
it it not going on facts	3 1 6 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 6 4
and discipline	6 7	6 6
but a lot of the industry	6 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
toward um improvement	6 6 7	6 6 6
i mean they were were there by choice	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6
so you know it it lot different now	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6
is that right	6 3 6	3 6 6
i noticed that one thing that that ti ti did	3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
he he at um	2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6
and there there they	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
you know for sofas and so forth	6 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
a repair place because theyll theyll tell me something something wrong with it and it it not	2 4 4 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 6 1 6
and we have a paper recycling	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
now i do do know how it will be this year you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6
beneath the doors	6 7 5	6 6 6
scene you know	2 6 6	6 6 6
even though	6 6	6 6
what do you what do you think of incaviglia incaviglia	6 6 6 7 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
they said that um that he was horrible	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and ive ive got some tomatoes	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
and that was it	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i bet these are really good seats	3 6 2 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
a lot of junk that should should be in there	7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
but but the uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
well yeah	6 6	6 6
it it amazing	6 6 6	3 1 6
i live in atlanta also	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4 4
none none right now	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
but um our chows weve weve had them	6 6 3 1 1 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
but it has the entire	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
and i do do think we ever will	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh i think that that what we might have to do with the chimney	6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
but during the fall when it stopped when uh	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and they give you such high credit limits	6 3 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
of so many people with with aids and with cancer	6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
the uh	6 6	6 6
youre youre right you know	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
well i- i	6 6 3	6 6 6
what it works out to	3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
adopt- adopt teams when i went go to a team- uh go to a town	7 5 2 7 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
i remember now	3 6 6	6 6 6
she had a she had a baby- a little boy	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
and then	6 6	6 6
and im im just wondering if youre youre fighting a natural process there	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
are you uh one who feels like youve youve have benefited from the change in in roles in women	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 7 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6
drugs of course uh a big part of it i think	2 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
when- you know when they were coming up i i did did sew	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 3 6 4 6
and send them to other parts of the state	6 6 3 6 7 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
and i could really talk about like gardening or something	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and and then uh then youre youre in the situation where youre youre very unhappy	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 3 3 1 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
i think that	3 6 6	6 6 6
and it it	6 6 6	3 6 6
and itd itd come right down to the end	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
i could have gone monday	3 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6
kind of a uh community	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
i mean you have the right to do a write in candidate	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
do you watch much tv tv	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
they do do have a very deep um	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but i- i rather imagine there there	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
my gosh	6 6	6 6
and i think that uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and in effect	6 6 6	6 6 6
after about three- couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car	6 7 5 5 6 7 6 3 6 6 6 2 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
like the-	2 4	6 6
what you could tell your kids	3 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
do they feel that way	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
so i have to throw them1 away cause there is no place to take glass	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
yeah that that that that	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i kind of	3 6 6	6 6 6
do they charge you for the deposit	6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think we are	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
and they were were testing any of those that were already working	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
there there no professional hockey teams in in	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
which is exactly what businesses do at the present	3 6 6 3 2 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
i wanna wanna do it about the same color	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
it- it- it it just so complicated	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
but i i felt	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i mean the the number of single	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know tell him hey stay in school	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
where else did we go um	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
if there there some minority that	6 6 6 2 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
and you begin to wonder	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre going to try to make it a real community center out there	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 5 6 6	3 6 6 6 1 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and states can- can use all the	6 2 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
for recycling purposes	2 7 5	6 6 6
and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 2 4
that we can make it on one income	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
i bought an audi five thousand	3 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
im im doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before i do	3 1 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
or something	2 3	6 6
separate them1	6 3	6 3
and uh	6 6	6 6
and we had her for six years until she just passed away	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it a philodendron	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
until uh his senior year	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
than nothing	6 3	6 6
wonder if i	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh not a whole lot uh	6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
you know ive ive taken time to teach them	6 6 3 1 6 2 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i think one of each experimented very slightly	6 3 6 7 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
think were were going in just a couple of weeks out to the east texas	6 3 1 6 6 2 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 3 4 4
well at first that always kind of bothered me	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
uh new education secretary and uh	2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 4 4 4 4
being up here we pretty much treat everybody	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
it it not as meaningful for me to go to minnesota and do something up there that ill ill never be able to see again	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
turnover- or	7 5	6 6
i heard it it a law that youre youre only allowed to have three layers of shingles	3 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
and there there no other real shut off valves inside the house	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
and ive ive got some broccoli	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
i have a good time with them	3 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i came up a couple times for an interview	3 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
well the uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and a t-shirt	6 2 4	6 3 6
and a lot of the usually fatalistic	2 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
because he wants somebody who will	6 3 6 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
it does	3 6	6 6
that that	6 6	3 1
but uh	6 6	6 6
i uh	6 6	6 6
my wife used to plant a few snow peas	2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i just really enjoy the	3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
there there been too much negative reinforcement	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
a paintbrush	2 4	3 6
so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole id id say uh give them the death penalty	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
home owners savings and loan in boston	2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
they should should catch themselves in that circumstance anyway	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
an honorary yankee	2 4 4	6 6 6
i just really do do see much use for this guy in milwaukee you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 3 2 3 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
views are are just kind of become a thing of the past	7 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
but there there no budget for them i guess	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
now this sounds dumb	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
is going to rob a 7-eleven whether he has a gun or a knife	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
it seems like every time im im short of cash i just go get get it from visa	6 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
i mean maybe it it	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
you sit there	3 6 6	6 6 6
they do do let me know	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
adults that is ca ca even read	2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
going to make some money	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6
we have the nfl nfl nfl that	3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
well i- i definetely- definitely advance that	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
it it one of those things	6 6 7 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
i was thinking of the one recipe that uh	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
maybe we maybe well well get your guy	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i used to have a	3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
i uh	6 6	6 6
im im in the air force	3 1 6 3 1 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
and uh when school lets out i just do do i have have i have no idea what im im going to do because i certainly ca ca afford what we did last year	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
but there was another um	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
but uh so i went to college and now since have completed two masters masters degrees	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 3 2 4 4
i sat there	3 6 6	6 6 6
i would would mind it if it was like	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
or the courts do do convict them	6 2 4 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their	6 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
you know benefits like retirement and	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6
standardized sentences	2 4	6 6
you look at frito lay	3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6
i think that that true	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
and it it fairly easy to	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i um	6 6	6 6
well it uh	6 3 6	6 6 6
i mean i i i have lived in and out of texas both in the service and	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 7	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
to do	2 4	6 6
in parts of inches you know half fourth you know this sort of thing	2 7 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
if some of the newspaper articles or the	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
you know it it going to kind of	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i mean i do do know if the kurdish	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
civic clubs will uh police a uh	7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and this is money that she she borrowed to- for her college education	6 3 6 2 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
i try to read a lot	3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4
boys clubs girls clubs things like that that kind of	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4 6 4
pace or my cordless phone	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
i think that that unbelievable	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
mine was just it had been wrecked	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
i just think employers have to have some kind of way	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4
now there is some really nice ones	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
we had a cat when we first married	3 6 2 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
and then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
get across the idea of voting	6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
but luckily thatll thatll all get straightened out	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
this needs to be done	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
taught in the home are not taught in the home rather	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i think	3 6	6 6
basically to	2 4	6 6
so it you know	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers	7 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4

i would would want to spend more than two nights	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
in other words if youve youve got a player on your team who who helping your team	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 4

you know	6 6	6 6
to part of this is is to	2 7 2 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
which is funny because i got called last night and the topic was uh something about juries	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
well that that good	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
very protective laughter-so	7 5 6	6 6 6
uh or if my call rate of of eight to- or so a week went up even higher because	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
and uh so when we are doing wardrobing and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 4
and you can just- see the things that theyre theyre trying to show with music	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
i just feel more-	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
is that true	6 3 6	6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
or uh	6 6	6 6
my dad could eat a a	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
in the recent months i- i- i do do have any problem with	7 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i agree because it it not fair to those of us laughter-that that	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 3 2 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
when it was just me	6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
to so that they know that uh you know	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
so that that a really stranger-	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
they call it the barrio down there	3 6 3 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
but last year he made one	6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
is that how it it worded	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
well what a what-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i guess	6 6	6 6
it says every- all sorts of factors go into health and there there no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together	3 6 6 2 4 7 5 6 6 2 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 3 1 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
it it it just too bad that we could could see that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6
something and maybe help other people at the same time	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
so well well talk about that some	6 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
it it very hard to find a spot	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4
and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof- roof was being repaired	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
well was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
and removed it	6 6 3	6 6 3
but i do do see much pollution going on	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
no this is not laughter-working	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
i made a little uh	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
you know if it does does impact you directly	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
and which i understand because she is you know a lot of movement and everything	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
obviously you do do need as much as far as	7 3 7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
how they were organized in	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
bureaucracy and in the politics of it	7 6 6 7 5 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 6 6
do do do do walk down a an alley	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 1 6 6 4 6 4
this plea bargaining baloney	7 5 5 5	6 6 4 6
uh and you know you	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i would say five years ago	3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
so it seems uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well i was just going to correct myself	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
driving an airplane or driving a bus or	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 7	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6
in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from	6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6
took it from me without me knowing really	6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6
i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
you do do have to go	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
you know people even wanting to play on their team	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
because you do do have anyway to turn it off	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
because it is	6 3 6	6 6 6
their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up	2 4 7 3 7 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
uh agreed with um	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
from other people people children and grandchildren	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
could be helped	2 4 4	6 6 6
we we were over at a neighbors neighbors tonight	6 7 6 6 6 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 6
they check that name against uh	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
and so it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
especially since you have a german	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 6
if you have two or three kids by the	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 7	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
brake fluid up	2 4 6	6 6 6
if i wanted my husband to do something to help	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 4 6 4
ive ive been to a couple ive ive been to a few games before	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 3 1 6 6
id id like to think that it it quite low at least in this country	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4
my husband was in the army	3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
i guess	3 6	6 6
youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
my grandparents told us when i was growing up and even when i was an adult	2 4 6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
fully functional	6 6	6 6
and i have very little of my own stuff	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do i do do think that that that my responsibility as a	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one	3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4	6 3 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
several percent	2 4	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
but um	6 6	6 6
if we do that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
uh take that as a challenge	6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
flower mound	3 1	6 6
were the new ones there	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
this this craziness	2 4 4	6 6 6
okay well	6 6	6 6
and you know theyve theyve committed murders and rapes and everything else	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 7 2 7 3 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 6
i do do know that it does	3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
think it it a good idea just because im im opposed to to the drugs	6 3 1 7 5 5 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
there some columns that could be painted a different color too	6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 4 4 4
everybody everybody got a secret	3 1 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 4
and it it up in the closet	6 3 1 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
but um	6 6	6 6
that is odd	3 6 6	6 6 6
um it it horrible	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
then they in turn will get	6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
rollers are so messy	2 6 6 6	6 2 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
well i mean it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i am i am right outside baltimore	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but were were going to try that and see how that works	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and she knows it it wrong	6 3 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 3 1 6
it it got pretty good acceleration too	3 1 6 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
it is	3 6	6 6
too many times	7 5 5	6 6 6
little thing he has in there to test them	7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
usually the bitterest weather	6 2 4 4	6 2 4 4
i had a pet rat	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
so whatever youre youre paid	6 3 1 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
oh at least	6 6 6	6 3 6
so basically i wore	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
or medicine	2 4	6 6
but they put out toxic chemicals there	6 2 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
telephone numbers that you can dial	7 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean forget- it it supposed to save you money	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 7 6	3 6 3 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
but i am in my thirties	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
i like	6 6	6 6
there there usually yeah there there usually something going on that that uh and	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
i think the facts would probably back it up	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
it it sounds like it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
up there in frederick	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
and it takes up your whole space	6 2 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i think they should	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
as our	6 2	6 6
uh would sleep on my chest	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
but then i thought about it	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
you know for them i mean they theyre theyre going to have to start gardening	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
almost destroyed the	6 6 6	6 6 6
so ive ive always	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
i- i- i-	6 6 6	6 6 6
all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base	3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
so it it really great	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
id id like to have a sports car too	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 3 1 2 4 6 6
but im im like you	6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh vcr vcr vcr or television repair	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 2 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i mean even- evidently a normal cow produces that much too	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
that that	6 6	3 1
and then uh they have one day for	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean if you if you vote and your guy looses well you least- you least tried	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
but uh yeah	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that great	3 1 6	3 1 6
were were busting out walls and things like that	2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so it was that same car	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
rather than put them in prison because1 prison prison proven not to work	7 5 5 2 7 2 7 2 4 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
we have two	3 6 2	3 6 6
and theyre theyre theyre theyre pretty fun to drive	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
there are some that are really short	6 6 7 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
right now we do do have a girl girl league because im im the one that that supposed to start one	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 6 3 1 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
that people come down on you	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
but i know that it it got to have a radio	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
here here what we expect of you	6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 4 6 6
the they- uh minimize the access	6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 4
people moving here from	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
work it way back into the soil	6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
uh and i do do know that uh a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
like in boston there was a case of uh	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
oh no	6 6	6 6
i read a lot of science fiction	3 6 3 1 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh a place in western pennsylvania called falling water	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
or there there a couple of other places that	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
how old are you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
you know they lost their job	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
have have been able to take really	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
and if they do catch them	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 6
if you want to go to school outside the country and many salvadorians did theyd theyd go to school in laughter-cornell iowa of all places	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 7 2 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
so the doctor had called her up and said	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
it it never over	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
with somebody youd youd probably have to go to out eat or something	2 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
that was uh that was something else	6 6 6 3 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
we lived in tennessee for awhile	2 6 6 2 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6
laughter-well ive ive done about all i can do which is	6 3 1 6 7 5 3 7 5 3 7	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
threw it away	6 3 6	6 6 6
wider the shot gets	6 7 5 6	6 3 4 6
and uh and what it really means to vote	2 4 4 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 4 4 6 2 4

a woman woman career would consist of a	2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3
youre youre reading dune	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
and there were some others	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6

that that a a little different situation	3 1 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4

because1 i was selling it	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they would would be able to	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 4 4

were you in the band	6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
so i can wander around without	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6
and then i have	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i remember a friend of mine	3 6 2 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 4
if the industry comes	6 2 4 6	6 3 4 4
it was like uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
now we go vote every time	6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 6
it was at night	6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6

convicted of uh you know	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
does seem that	6 6 6	6 6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
well what they do is is they say	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i went the next morning to arlington	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
id id	3 1	3 1
and i just said this is this is terrible	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
she knows something right that she needs-	3 6 3 2 3 1 2	6 6 4 6 6 6 4
they can	6 6	6 6
was it battle cry of freedom	6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
as a given in any military operation	6 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but it it always well	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
instead of flour	2 4 4	6 6 6
when i was in college	6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 2 4
and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4
and i really enjoyed that	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
as part of my part of the program	6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know the technicians work the eight to five job and	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6

of theirs all the structures of their society	7 5 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
oh boy	6 6	6 6
if it it no one that i know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life	6 6 6 3 1 1 1 2 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
because ive ive never seen citizen kane	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 7 5 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i could swear it was ibm ibm ibm	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6
the social structure of the soviet union you know it it it it it coming apart at the seams	7 5 5 2 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4

so we got the kind we wanted	6 3 6 3 1 1 1	6 3 6 2 4 6 4
they can they can actually they can pump water	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
everybody would-	3 6	6 6
to get	6 6	6 6
that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
um i think that there are people that i think that uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
do you mean	6 3 6	6 6 6
so you know it it it it not a great indication because	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 1 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
forty cents more	6 6 6	6 6 6
and there there a team	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i mean you	6 6 6	3 6 6
and it turned out she was the assistant manager	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
we- everybody down here calls these flags	6 3 2 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i tell you what im im finding frightening	3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
run into a	2 4 4	6 6 6
that was even harder	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
laughter-when laughter-those people are are there anymore	6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just- just to do just that	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
most of them now you know you do do go through the ignition stuff anymore because that that all solid state or	7 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 4 4 6
i do do know how much	3 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6

i ca ca imagine what kind of uh	3 6 6 6 2 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
they should should be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4

well you can talk for ten minutes	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i think	3 6	6 6
but you did did necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 2 4

but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4

it it kind of like the inside dual on a truck	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4
but at least it was a bb bb gun not a twenty or a four ten or something	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
i mean even california was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issue	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4

so we deserve it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 3
you know the the aging hippie near forty mother	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
you sell the refrigerator	6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4
dropping out	7 5	6 6
i guess it it an eighty or ninety	3 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 2 4 6 4
got taken to court by the school system	6 6 6 2 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
and then go from there	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
because i do do know if that that necessarily the case anymore	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i try and vote in every single election	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4

and uh	6 6	6 3
those fish are just beautiful	3 1 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
it really is	3 6 6	6 6 6
and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6

that the sales reps drive around in	3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i did it by hand	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
but but if-	6 6 6	6 6 6
i am nervous in dallas	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
what did you think about the coverage like over in the uh persian gulf	7 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4

a yes sir we should have drug testing because there there really a problem	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4
my- in my situation	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
so uh	6 6	6 6
kids killing each other and beating their brains out	2 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
do do have the background for an mit mit mit kind of curriculum	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7	3 1 6 2 4 6 3 4 4 6 6 6 4
she would you know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
we need to have stiffer punishments you know	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
and i and so it was kind of like it it they	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
but it it been real interesting and kind of fun	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
i mean i do do think that guns should be outlawed	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
ive ive seen the signs	3 1 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6

it it it it so um	6 6 3 1 6 6	3 1 6 4 6 6
well there are a lot of things that are are	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
three years	7 5	6 6
and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
you know whole	6 2 4	6 6 6
and um theyre theyre all over the world	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
true in a lot of our	6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
well the last time	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
it it a deterrent to crime	3 1 1 1 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
uh movies	2 4	6 6
but they can pump water up from the shore	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
kids that are- get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there	2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 4 2 4 4
that that all there is to it	3 1 7 6 7 5 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
but uh they	6 6 3	6 6 6
but i mean there there there there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well i do do have so much trouble with products as service	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
and i have a daughter in	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
that that what my brother was telling me	3 1 1 1 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 3

with a big full back yard which	6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i do do think will be necessarily	3 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it good when you go to tom thumb though	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6

over two	2 4	6 6
course she grew up catholic	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
to keep it to keep it becoming- from becoming even more obnoxious	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
a miniature schnauzer	2 4 4	6 6 6
so i think that that what uh i im im going to have to get next time around	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
even with a machine	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
ugh they need to stay outside far away from me	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
support because you know it was	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave	3 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you ca ca	2 6 6	6 6 6
i think	3 6	6 6
that that what happens every time	3 1 1 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
i think first degree murder	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
well all right	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i keep thinking you know it it not it it really not too late	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the gi gi bill	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 6
theyre theyre going to get complaints or theyre theyre going to get sued or	3 1 6 6 6 7 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 3 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
in the chamber	6 3 1	6 6 6
were were rearranging our house because1 the bedrooms are kind of small	3 1 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
my husband had originally wanted an akita	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
so there there a good combination in the hallways all the time you know	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6
and the	6 6	6 3
in a few years i mean	6 7 5 5 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
but there are i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 1 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
just get out you know out and about	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
brother-in-law works there	2 6 6	6 6 6
you know and im im sure itd itd be even less for somebody with a good gun	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4 6
yeah it was almost like october of eighty	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and the kids want to swing	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and they do um they do do a lot of the refining up there	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 2 4 4 4
but you have the music and	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
with the owner of the store	6 2 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 2 4
they call it the cape cod of the uh the midwest	3 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 4
youre- youre- youre youre not going to want to have them have that crime- uh that punishment	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
and those cases are of	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 4 4 4
and he should	6 6 6	6 6 6
the prisoner himself can come to the point that	2 4 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
because1 i do do mind doing that	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i had a lot of loam out there to start with	3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6
you know really encourage them1 to go to college and stuff	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
for the first time we planted them this year	6 2 4 4 3 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
do that are are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff	2 3 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
i mean i	6 6 3	6 6 6
to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
and ive ive never actually had too many people explain to me why it it a problem though i	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 3 6 2 4 4 4
so they	6 6	6 6
and then some on the side of the house with the	2 4 7 2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
i mean all you do is to get guns	6 6 7 3 7 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
or whatever	7 3	6 6
oh i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
i do do even know if you have to perform community service	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i live near a walmart	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
now are	6 6	6 6
thered thered be nineteen rather than one	6 6 6 3 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 4 6 4
um there	6 6	6 6
he says my father gave it to me	3 6 2 4 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i have had this real problem with a	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
it it just nice that cats you know cats yeah you do do have to let them outside you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 3
and a lot of it it for the better	6 7 5 2 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i dont- i guess i mean that may sound that sounds cold	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
ive ive got all my gas cards because1 i do do want to carry money around	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
well they um you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
that that what everyone says	3 1 1 1 6	3 1 6 6 6
i do do uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
we saw-	3 6	6 6
theyre theyre getting a kind of	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
i was with ti ti in	3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
well i work	6 3 6	6 6 6
ive ive always felt for a long time that i i think that	3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6
judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
the people that do the	2 4 3 2 7	6 6 6 6 6
up you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
and it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
theyll theyll theyll theyll stalk your house and uh	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
to williamsburg and spent a night	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
administrator in the montgomery county	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
i think we ought to worry about our own species	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
i just	6 6	6 6
and when you see uh koreans and chinese and japanese	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
year round fairly not wide fluctuations	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
i have have been doing	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
um i think with uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 4
getting mugged	6 6	6 6
but then you know there there the process of selection	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 2 4
of course	6 6	6 6
i think that that	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh liberal	6 6	6 6
it was a marvelous opportunity that i could could have done	3 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5	3 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
with uh a certain	2 4 7 5	6 6 6 4
do you have any pets	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
but the only result is otherwise he gets life in prison	6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
rather than just little fish	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
tuned you know tuned up and	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i i do do much care for michael j fox anyway	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
great big huge garbage cans	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
and im im not sure that about yesterday	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
they just show you the words and the facts	3 6 6 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
and our	6 6	6 6
reinforcement with them at home also	2 6 3 6 2 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
that that what i keep telling this laughter-person	3 1 1 1 6 6 3 1	3 1 3 6 6 6 6 4
well it it it went pretty	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
well now	6 6	6 6
the father father attitudes about you know whose- whose job is this	2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make	6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 7 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
it it such a trouble- it it such a trouble here	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 6	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
that that	3 1	3 1
we do do have a	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
and you could always find some channel that had something on	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
some of those certainly have a lot of disabilities- difficulties you know with uh	7 2 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
but i you know im im real concerned that i- i do do want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 3
well i do not know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
that should be a lot of fun	3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it like let let see if we can get her to run up her bills	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest	6 6 6 7 6 6 2 3 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
even when she does does go to the health club she runs you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6
i do do see someone not going out there	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
especially for handguns	2 4 4	6 6 6
instead of	6 6	6 6
and then god gave me this dog	6 6 3 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do either	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and he he the president	6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
but they were neat enjoyable animals to have	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i do do know what else- i do do	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 1
but i enjoy it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
and it took me	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and sent them1 a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces	6 6 3 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
i mean it was	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it because	6 6 6	3 1 6

their society is is there anymore	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
im im in central- i lived in central california	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
when i read it i should have realized that because1 i mean it had foster foster style written all over laughter-it	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 2 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
but i guess just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff there people up there	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4

and in the	6 6 6	6 6 6
so were were just going to let them go	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
the guy said itd itd been on the lot about thirty minutes	2 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and were were beginning to see	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4
they do do expand or	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
oh absolutely	6 6	6 6
uh when you paint the ceiling	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 4
and one of the men got	6 7 2 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 6
theyre theyre pretty neat little	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
but they	6 3	6 3
then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
i see	3 6	6 6
uh which is happening until	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
round about1 times of battle of hastings you know and that	6 6 2 6 7 2 4 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6
um so it it really you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 3
and what what it gonna gonna be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son son in high school	6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 6 6
am pretty much against it	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
those chemicals would not	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
at new years we had some people come in and	6 2 4 3 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well i had kind of gotten used to	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the um buyer and the seller	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
quite frankly a loser in life	2 4 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 4
and it it the law that you have a gun	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
inverse of what they should be like uh	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
thanks for talking	6 6 6	6 6 6
about the gun control laws	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
well so am i	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
but i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
and when it	6 6 6	6 6 6
you pretty	3 6	6 6
but that would come down	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre good for storage and stuff like that	3 1 6 6 2 7 2 4 3	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
uh laws or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by	6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
twenty hundred square foot	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4
to recycle	2 4	6 6
i was going to read while it was on	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that what im im thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because1 last two cars are brand new	3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean	3 6	6 6
i was seeing what they was banging on	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i bought them1 and	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 3
what what that mean	7 5 2 6	3 1 6 6
um even uh i did did	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean ive ive ive ive	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
you know you just ca ca do that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
that that that that	6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6
that sort of thing	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
do you grow those those ten fifteen y	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i do	3 6	6 6
and i think it kind of took that um	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
a little	6 6	6 6
oh my mom and dad read all the time	6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
uh brought in	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
uh have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 2 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 6
person running it i mean you you could expect that you	2 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
but it it just	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
so that that why the defense is there	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
but uh you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
not having to take everything	7 5 5 5 3	6 6 4 4 4
and if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
some beets uh potatoes	2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6
i know	3 6	6 6
put down anything that came at them1	2 4 3 1 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but we have got more women in it now	6 7 6 6 2 4 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
the regular place where it it	2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 3 6 4
we do do even know where one is	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know if youve youve tried it	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	3 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6
but anyway	6 6	6 6
it used to be jewish you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i agree	3 6	6 6
my solution to that is that we hold it on sundays	2 4 4 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
it is	3 6	6 6
there was one	6 6 6	6 6 6
i do do know what the answer is to that	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
youre youre being	3 1 6	3 1 6
with soy-	2 4	6 6
well i did did tell you what year	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that really neat	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i think that	3 6 6	6 6 6
so theyre theyre definitely going to work towards being good you know rather than trying to act up and be bad	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 6 6 6 4
care provider	3 1	6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
my parents my parents made a mistake in	6 6 2 4 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i think that that kind of a good show	3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
you know great stardom or anything	6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i do do know what needs to be done you know	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
oh that would be a mess	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
i was the i think the ninety eighth laughter-person laughter-theyd laughter-theyd laughter-interviewed	3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 3 1 6
it it not	3 1 6	3 1 6
even ladies that thatll thatll work and have a baby and then	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
so i do do offend anybody	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
you- you know i think that you have really hit on something there	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i know a lot of companies that waste so much that	3 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 6
and i went to uva uva uva	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
and you have to remember that it it it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6
theyre theyre already talking about it	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
finds the basement sales and just like you know	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4 4 4 6 6 6
they got to had	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you- did you actually live in saint louis	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
do you like scary things	6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
i know that especially with violent crimes where	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
your money and slit your throat which	2 4 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh the rest of it was	6 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 4
i mean they	3 6 6	6 6 6
it was wild	3 6 6	6 6 6
i mean you ca ca believe that	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 6
they both do the same kind of job	3 2 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i would would	3 6 6	6 6 6
we have	3 6	6 6
that that a little bits extreme	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4 4
so in in terms of that it it	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
ive ive heard that they were very good	3 1 6 6 2 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i go quite frequently	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
they make a	6 6 6	3 6 6
theyll theyll try something	3 1 6 3	3 1 6 6
plaintiff or the defendant	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4
and maybe now i do do remember if this is texas or not	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
oh gee she hated baths worse than anything	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
who got himself really messed up um having- having been involved with drugs	3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
i come from florida	3 6 6 2	3 6 6 4
mine is mixed up too	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and a cop comes up	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
do do even bother	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
i used to have the opinion that there was- that there really was was any more crime	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
the topic today was	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
and oh i eventually worked in a lab	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
was the whole face done or just the numbers	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
higher ups like the the lawyers- the ti ti lawyers and uh	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
and then	6 6	6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
an hour	7 5	6 6
like reimbursed for or paid for	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
and he was um	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
if the gun shop owner does it	6 2 4 4 4 6 3	6 3 6 4 6 6 6
kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk	2 6 6 6 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
someone losing their life for something-	3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
you do do even know who to payoff huh	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
but it it like	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and well they do do call it remedial reading these days	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
i have always done that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3
because theyre theyre fancy seats and stuff	6 3 1 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
to kilometers per hour and the whole nine yards	6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
convinced that theyre theyre guilty and without much	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 3 6 1 6 6 4 4
i think	3 6	6 6
but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that um	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
they had a a table	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 6
level offense they lose their citizenship	2 4 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
well pensacola has	6 3 6	6 6 6
simply because people were so	6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and on my	6 6 7	6 6 6
factual information to us	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6
what percentage of them1 would actually	7 5 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
uh illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse	6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
so it it trying to push the weight plus	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
she was okay for a couple of years	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
your car is fuming and everything	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i like um	3 6 6	6 6 6
to build to build more you know and keep these people in them1 you know	6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 4
so what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to	6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 6
ive ive got to have time	3 1 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6
on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
that that probably true	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and that that always kind of bothered me	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
the c i a is a a very	3 1 1 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i think so	3 6 6	6 6 6
it hurts your ears to hear it	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 3
ours are the double pane	3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6
a attitude of not	7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6
more and more the attitude attitude getting that a way	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
and a degree out there means a lot	6 2 4 4 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but when it comes to palestinians	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 2 4
it could very easily be supported with facts	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
even though	6 6	6 6
i know it is	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
and i asked him uh	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
were were so i would	6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
oh you have a pool there too	6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
that that huge	3 1 6	3 1 6
and then you had like who	6 6 3 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 3
contact with that	2 4 3	6 6 6
two nights is good	3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6
what kind of car are you	7 5 5 5 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 4
it it terrible	3 1 6	3 1 6
probably it a hassle	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
and it just	6 6 6	6 6 6
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that	3 6 7 2 7 2 7 2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
oh i did did realize that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 1 6 6
actually he had no trouble at all	6 3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
perform this conversion anyway	6 3 1 6	6 6 4 4
you know we have just as we have a right- a duty to pay taxes	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4
people in the nation	2 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
i do do really need their help to do that	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
anybody that went in there and they asked a question	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
laughter-on laughter-drugs	6 2	6 6
laughter-it laughter-is	3 6	6 6
and you know changing the plugs and stuff	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
would uh	6 6	6 6
when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty we really only had a fifty percent turnout	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
ive ive seen all of this	3 1 6 7 2 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
and the state still ca ca bring itself to	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
my husband was in the service	3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
but the actual quitting	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4
and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with	6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1 2 3 2 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6
this is about twenty years ago	3 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
and i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4
and then you dial in an access code	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
you have to look out for yourself	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
which is is very much specific-	3 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
but one individual got twenty	6 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
shoot- i you know ive ive got one of those in brian brian room	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 2 3 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty mile an hour speed limit because1 what is it fifty	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 6 2 4
when i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
uh pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this was was something new just to keep out of going to war	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4

which is really strange	3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6

i cannot cannot remember too much about it	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
because they do do pay	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 1 6
and i think dallas has enough to offer that they do do have to hog everything	6 3 6 2 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4

well i think they are stopped blooming now in the spring	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4
they have uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
it was something else	6 6 3 2	6 3 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
you can get to them	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4
from love canal	6 2 4	6 6 6
oh i bet the black one one pretty	6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6

but our peaches they they seem to be doing just fine	6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and the first thing they said is	6 2 4 4 3 2 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6
i mean uh you know you ca ca live in dallas without you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4

of course the only sound is dudley moore narrates it	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6
but then i got- i got to thinking	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
your house sounds like mine because1 mine mine pier and beam too	3 1 6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4

and that was actually after the war was over	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
what was called talking blues	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6

uh one picks up real quick	6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre just not doing it	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
but they they said they ca ca be smashed or else um it does does fit in their little containers	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4

i feel kind of weird about that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean my god they fought and won the whole thing	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
and and she does does enjoy it when it it a chore	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
is that is that how you got into this uh	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well that that neat	6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6
on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
that that it	3 1 6	3 1 6
if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6

what what kind of work do you do	6 7 5 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
and after the fact the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that	6 6 2 4 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6

during the real hot summer months you know until i retired	6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of	7 5 5 5 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6
and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
uh well theyre theyre theyre theyre coming from various places	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 4 4
and ive ive seen how their school system works	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6

but it it real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and itll itll send out a flower spike	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know when you shop you usually compare the prices	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4

and if the people they committed a crime against	6 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4
you got to have	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
do you do a lot of camping	6 3 6 7 5 2 3	6 3 6 3 6 2 4

put it on your shoe now	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
they probably built that in so they could make money	3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and he he now a young man about	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and it it building up you know	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
oh my goodness	6 6 6	6 6 6
the things in the world	2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
where the children were there in the facility but	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
which actually is rap	3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got	6 3 6 2 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 1 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
then my father got us some tickets	6 2 4 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4

you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4

and if they go away	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
i do do think ive ive ever seen them1	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
now my daughter	6 3 1	6 6 6
any sort of	7 5 5	6 6 6
but so	6 6	6 6
short nerdy guy with glasses	2 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 4
the antismog pumps	2 4 4	3 6 6
i uh i find that uh	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
well nobody feels responsibility to do something	6 3 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know cut	6 6 2	6 6 3
it it pretty far to throw that far	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
but when i go out somewhere	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
i was so irritated	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
ill then	6 6	6 6
what does that make me	3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
and then the cat uh died	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
really though i mean that that one thing that	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
we try our hardest to get them1 to eat what we eat you know	3 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
that that putting out a lot of dark	3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
good i would	6 3 6	6 6 6
well he grew up in le	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh cathedral ceilings	6 2 4	6 6 6
what are you doing with that	7 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 4
i- i used to read a lot more than i do now	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
i told them if they do do vote they do do have the right to criticize	3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
we just saw him	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
so i guess my experience is is just with what we did	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 2 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
you know i	6 6 6	6 6 6
sentencing procedure	2 4	6 6
they did did strip it	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
i mean there there	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
have you ever used those	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
go on to some new technology	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 4
but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
im im going to be real good	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
i could see capital punishment in a case like that	3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 6
see that would be great because1 then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 7 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
of course were were	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
or whatever it is neutered	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
i like you say yes	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
im im a doctoral student at university of central florida	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 6 6 4 2 4 4
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to	6 6 3 2 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 6 6 6 4 6
something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago	3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
well that that	6 3 1	3 6 6
in the minimum payment trap	6 2 4 4 4	6 3 4 4 6
so that means if i knock out the wall	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
and how many people especially here in texas	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
so i said yeah if i can have an ibm ibm ibm for forty percent discount ill ill take it	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6

and were were gonna gonna try to teach him good values because1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 6	6 3 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
well i- i think-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
we had never been there	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
like i say i do do think the guy who who going to rob a 7-eleven	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
anything that the	3 1 1	6 6 6
and and i- i feel as though	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6

howard garrett organic enthusiasts or a neil sperry	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
or at least for the last twenty years or so ive ive felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
but it is something that that a little frightening	6 3 6 3 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 1 6
for the green card	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
if you were educated you got	6 3 6 6 6 6	3 6 2 4 6 6

i think she she laughter-pregnant	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
ooh who who who	6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6
he he part owner	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
you know i i just	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
but really bad it um	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 6
and then	6 6	6 6
because i was actually applying for a job in texas	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and they were just going to throw them away	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
well i was just	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
per let let say afflicted person	2 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
they do do kill them1	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
you know people that	6 6 2 3	3 6 6 6
so i was real good	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well you know it it cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that are all ready	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 4
oh i guess it it been awhile for me	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
uh high humidity	2 7 5	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
when he he home	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
sounds good	6 6	6 6
see you	6 3	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
you know in other kinds of ways	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
it it where it it most expedient which	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4
like a lake or something running through it	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6
i wonder	3 6	6 6
you know who treats me very	6 2 3 2 3 2	3 6 3 6 6 4
i- i know the government sells information to private companies	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4
i tried it like once or twice	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
or have more to do	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
you start hearing noises you know	3 6 6 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
they can play with anything make it a gun	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 4
i guess well well	3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
so that that that that what im im pursuing right now	6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6
he has has done	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 7 2 3 1 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 2 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4
well that may be right	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and what do you think that problem is	6 7 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
im- im- im im sure you do	6 6 3 1 6 3 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
me neither	3 6	6 6
more concern about some of these things that that cost us money	7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 6 2 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4
sometimes you do do even want to be	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i could never	3 6 6	6 6 6
he he set	6 6 6	3 1 6
they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4
you are kidding	3 6 6	6 3 6
out there	6 6	6 6
theyre theyre theyre theyre convicting them faster than theyre theyre	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 1 6 2 4 4 6 6
some of those get very philosophical	7 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4
my brother brother like that	3 1 1 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
um so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that that not too painful	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
testing for random drugs	7 5 2 4	6 3 4 4
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know youre youre going there	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
you do do hear much on the news about young people really	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
he was raised on a farm in southern ohio near dayton	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
and they do do bother to listen to what any of them have to say	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
did did learn to take responsibility because	2 4 4 4 4 7 2	3 1 6 6 4 4 4
compared to other parts of the country you know	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6
well the uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
social changes	3 1	6 6
and she said there there a lot of longevity in that name said my cow lived seventeen years	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 3 1 2 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
itd itd been	6 6 6	3 1 6
because1 there there been kids that age who have killed people	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that	6 6	3 1
not at all	6 6 6	6 6 6
and so	6 6	6 6
is doing it too	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it it really kind of funny	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
i remember when they were coming home	3 6 6 2 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know going through high school and everything	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said he remodeled it	6 3 6 6 7 5 3 7 3 7 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
so she tried to enter her number	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
try to read everything they write	6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
and then they they uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that got to be frustrating	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4
you know between it and rap	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
they work	3 6	6 6
i usually	3 6	6 6
ive ive talked to a lot of people in texas	3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
at least in some ways	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
um that said you know hey	2 3 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
there needs to be	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
so ill ill tell you	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
but mostly petty things and nothing- nothing- nothing nothing really too big	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
what- what this guy guy going to do	6 3 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 1 6 2 4
stuff ready	7 6	6 6
some kind of	7 5 5	6 6 6
a kid	7 5	6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
they do	3 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
has a mastercard and a visa card	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
you know theyll theyll have to eat the laughter-charge	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know youve youve been married three or so years	6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it just such a huge expense	3 1 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
it it sounds like	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
i know the day care centers are not cheap either	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
it it kind of a traction control i think they call it	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 3 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 6 6
the best cars	2 4 4	6 6 6
all right uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
im im glad you put it that way	3 1 6 3 6 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
and we bought one	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
im im im im pursuing what they what what what what called an interdisciplinary field	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
when you go to a restaurant like kids are running all over the place they	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
by the time it gets there	6 7 5 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
it was about four to five years ago	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
so uh the saint louis cardinals are one	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
is where they started getting into so much	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
believe me it it just so much better	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4
of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
if that that the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves	6 3 1 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
i thought it was a fantastic idea	3 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 4 4
you in washington dc dc or washington state	3 6 2 4 4 7 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4
call the crisis line	6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6
there has	6 6	6 6
i do do know if i know anything or not	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
this one guy	7 5 5	6 6 6
you know it it like uh this guy was like	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
is just	2 4	6 6
and theyre theyre	6 6 6	6 6 6
and served time at a penitentiary uh	6 6 2 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6
shoot maybe	6 6	6 6
i rented a lot of videos	3 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4
do something outrageous to them1	6 3 7 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and uh in his classes theyre theyre using there there a bunch- theyre theyre running a bunch of scenes from the godfather	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
oh no	6 6	6 6
so it it got a lot to do with	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i never have either	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and they have one	6 6 6 6	6 3 4 6
using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
all right	6 6	6 6
this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
and sweeping it out everyday it it really hard to to keep the sand and dirt out of it	6 6 3 6 7 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
does your job require you to drive company equipment or to	6 2 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3
you said youre youre from atlanta	3 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6
and uh it did did seem like it was	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
how many kids do you have	2 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that	3 1	3 1
five dollars a call	3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6
this position	2 4	6 6
i do do know if it should be an option	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
bicycling uh	2 4	6 6
it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 2 4 4
especially letters	2 4	6 6
they just think that that the normal thing to do do do they	3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 3 1 6
in this area	6 7 5	6 6 6
there there no really recycling facilities	6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
it it uh teacup	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
they are doing a whole bunch better	3 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
what organization it it under	2 4 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
it it really sad	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
that suited my needs	3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
weve weve got power surges on the west side of our house	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
ca ca stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 6 3 6 3 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
a history	7 5	6 6
you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4
and we have to separate our papers	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
it it just like bye	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
uh nothing	7 2	6 6
just let them1 go	7 5 3 7	6 6 6 6
or if theyve theyve sent you a uh	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i mean youve youve got a little place on one side or the other	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and you know if i i did did wait five years for it to be good enough laughter-grow	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
he has has been found guilty of it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think uh	6 6 6	6 6 3
but they had enough power to	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
it it it just uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
because when you do have to be in front of people	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports	6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
oh that that not unusual	6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
it it a fairly decent book	3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 6
cookouts and stuff like that	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
credit cards	2 4	6 6
i mean face it	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 3
oh of course	6 6 6	6 6 6
the senator from west virginia this information	2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well first i think theyve theyve got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i i needed to	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
is that a tough system to be in	6 3 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
after school	6 2	6 6
and so it it	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
i think it it uh	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
i mean you just	6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6
and we used to laughter-go go to their games all the time	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
actually- actually it it done uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
i do do know something something got to change with the schools	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and you are supposed to feel safe	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
that that how it works	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 4
my um	2 4	6 6
has has quite made it yet	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage	7 5 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 4 6
i mean im im im im thinking of research in that direction rather than	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6
you know by force	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
i would think that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
you know what kind of options theyve theyve got	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
what gets me is i ca ca believe that congress um	3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
course we had had one coach	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
go in the early hours	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i do do remember what the other one is	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
and um i guess i had a crack in the block	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
um ive ive never worn	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
let me tell you just a little bit about myself	6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and he had uh he had not uh displayed any	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i know	6 6	6 6
and we do do really care about you as an individual	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know i thought i would go to florida a couple summers ago	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
he was so excited about going	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
because it	6 6	6 3
crime is one of those things that that uh	2 6 7 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
by the time youve youve finally got down to it	6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
there should be some law against the types of gun-	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
had to put in	7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6
what would happen	7 6 6	6 6 6
but a great book one called	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6

and you can actually see it	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 3
he was going to change it	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6
you know when you graduate from college theyll theyll send you all those credit card applications you know	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 3 1 6 3 7 5 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
well a friend of mine had um an eel	6 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 2 4
i do do think although	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
you can have the car	3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
but um	6 6	6 6
so like the den and the living room	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
but i think a lot of it you know i think things come both from the	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
do you consider the soviet union a threat	6 3 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and the bill would come in	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3
to do something	7 5 3	6 6 6
hop- hop on the interstate	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 4
oh she was telling me all her problems	6 3 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
it it good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 6 3 6 3 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
now whether they finally got it or not i do do know	6 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6
i do do think	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and then also so that i can uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
so i still throw away a lot of glass	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
i was just cleaning and throwing	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6
and that that how it is in new york	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i think it would be	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
anybody could get	3 2 4	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles	2 4 4 7 5 3 1 7 5 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
with a camper conversion on it	2 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do think it it a bad idea	3 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 3 1 2 4 6
during the trial as to whether theyre theyre guilty or not has nothing to do with their background	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
if i can just nuke it id id do it	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4
but they could could put two and two together as far as the law was concerned	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
no matter what youre youre promised during a campaign	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and ive ive just stuck with it	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
but diner is really worth seeing	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
well see to me	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 6 4 4 4
i guess we did did have it high enough or he did did get hit in just the right spot	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
well football-	6 6	6 6
i know it sounded strange to me too	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
most recent ones that ive ive seen are those	2 4 4 3 1 1 2 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and so were were going to enlarge our master bedroom	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
we kind of need maybe one more room	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
started it again too just late or within the past few years	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
if youre youre probably going	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
if you had to	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in fact fact nobody going to beat us then	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and finally	6 6	6 6
do you	6 3	6 6
id id love to get used to that shotgun	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
in the same category with uh	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
and i got uh caught up with a class i was taking at ti ti	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 3 6 4
and many of my peers were being drafted	6 7 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and some for some reason those people do do see that	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
nursing homes to me	2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6
and i saved forty percent	6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6
have the places-	6 6 6	6 6 6
if it does people go what what this stuff	6 3 6 2 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
and they tithe	6 3 6	6 6 6
well my my personal preference is is a dog	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4
that that a real good deal	3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
something else was made out of old tires	3 2 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well see that that what i would think	6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
i was born in buffalo	3 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6
what what really works uh at least down here	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
that ti ti fleet	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
the river walk area which is the tourist area	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
now we	6 2	6 6
um i i was taking a voice io io class	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4
it it all the dirt i have left in my backyard	6 6 7 5 5 3 2 4 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6
if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year	6 7 5 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 3
very few people will ever stay home	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
well i- i uh i have to agree with that	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6
getting rid of that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 4
do do really have a problem with	6 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 2 4 6
but this looks like floor	6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
that that that that got to	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6
well the question is you know do you think	6 7 5 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
and the youngest is probably twenty	6 3 1 6 6 7	6 3 6 2 4 6
i came from a house in colorado which had the cathedral ceilings	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
a little bit cheaper in the long run	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia	6 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
i mean that that a losing fight	6 6 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
send it to this address	6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
but you really need to see that movie	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 4
these telephone conversations have revolved around um	3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
i mean i think that that the	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
a pet cow	2 4 4	6 6 6
like sitting in your living room	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6
i do do	3 6 6	6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
if im im	6 3 1	6 6 6
and it it not worth it	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6
teach them	6 3	6 6
people that	2 3	6 6
the two little cars ive ive got now	2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i got ive ive ive got one vice	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
like milk cartons or if they have water in them1	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and they they tell me the same thing	6 6 3 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote	6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
i got until may till im im out	3 6 6 2 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
not years ago	6 2 6	6 6 6
but there there a element that ca ca	6 6 6 7 5 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
the yearly fee it was like forty dollars	2 4 4 3 2 4 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
actually i did did hear it	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
in the uh state land grant colleges which which is is i mean	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
you know there there a lot to learn	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
if you are going to be planning on doing that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
weve weve had um	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
i- i did grow up with david brinkley	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
well same here	6 6 6	6 6 6
it proper name is gomphrena	2 4 4 6 7	6 6 6 6 4
generally if were were gonna gonna get them it it not going to happen	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
but the other two i feel uh would give either	6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
it it like one arm giving the other a transfusion	3 1 6 7 5 6 2 4 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that that a lawyer	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 7 5 3 1 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 3 1 2 4
well you know it it it it one of those things	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
if enough people	7 2 4	6 6 6
you know more healthier you know	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and it went over ten minutes	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean i i	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
and which is is alway- always the case in all cultures	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
and then oh march came around	6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
to do that	6 6 3	6 6 6
the news	3 1	3 6
there there	6 6	3 1
yes it was really pretty interesting	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
uh i find myself listening to popular music	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
the strategy of how baseball works	7 5 5 5 2 7	6 6 6 6 4 4
or is it a life sentence	6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6
enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6
at you know at at the most out of a decent fabric	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
ca ca call them the new orleans saints any more	6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
over there off of like	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the middle east war we just had where president bush went out and got	6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
we really did not	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
so i do do see camping	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
you know things like to hear you know what they call world music	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
program now is a uh program now is uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
i do do think theyre theyre going to because1 they do think that their that anybody	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
and those are neat	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4
you know it it right there on	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 1 6 6 6
it it a legal job you know	3 1 1 1 1 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and they react	6 3 6	6 6 6
and so many of those kind of people they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but yeah	6 6	6 6
but they got it for a friend	6 3 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it uh it it pretty also pretty typical for the area	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
oh he he got a blue tongue	6 3 1 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
and we completely stripped- completely stripped all the old wood shingles off	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
centers from very early	7 2 6 6	6 6 4 6
and we thought about getting it sprayed	6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
dairy farms in that one county	2 4 6 3 1 1	6 6 2 4 4 6
it it the parochial schools that i guess many times-	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
it it going to tax you physically	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i mean not not at first	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
apparently they do do think it it a problem	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 4
well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 4
more especially where you are	7 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
per year affected by this one	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
you know and uh just have them for the next year	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
at one time or another ive ive	6 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
it it makes me feel like well	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
it it basically all brick	6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house	2 4 4 6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
i have	3 6	6 6
for the optima	6 2 4	6 6 6
but i see it myself	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 4
oh no	6 6	6 6
theyre theyre putting in fifty sixty hours a week im im sure because1 they they got to grade papers and get class	3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is um	6 3 6 7 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
i think i can leave them home	3 6 3 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it was pretty easy doing it ourself	6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and he he excited to get there in the morning and just does does even want to kiss me good-bye	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
but ill ill probably um	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
weed out drugs in states	7 5 2 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
well im im going to have to get some	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
if you compound that	6 3 6 6	6 3 4 6
they are	3 6	6 6
i like the group	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
i mean i	6 6 6	3 6 3
with uh anthony quinn	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
she you know lost all her activity	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 2 4
half of the roof off	7 2 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6
or maybe there there a small need for money	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4
what about	6 6	6 6
or in fact one has finished now	6 6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
people that	2 3	6 6
play time to	2 4 6	6 6 6
i i see a lot of things like uh scouting	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
sounds the- sounds so much different	6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
you know all of her dreams will be dispelled	6 6 7 2 4 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and and uh that that pretty much all the houses in the area	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
and when you send it to washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there	6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 4
that that kind of like what we would like to do	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
uh a lot of uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 4
say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and	6 7 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 3
even then theyre theyre skimming over	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
it had a whole lot of miles on it	3 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
hemmed in	6 6	6 6
same with drunk drivers	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
but the people that she got	6 2 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 2 4
and here	6 6	6 6
is it formal policy that they said they might	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 4
and um the there is men and also women	6 6 6 6 6 2 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
but theyre theyre not that much fun you know	6 2 4 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
never show any anyway anything that i ever wanted	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6
and i like the national news that we see	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
and things are starting to fail	6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
that i see in a area like ours	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
is this the first year they have been up	6 3 2 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and are connected with the schools	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
you wonder if being exposed to that for a while	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you too	3 6	6 6
i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote	6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
so uh	6 6	6 6
you know so many women could not afford	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4
uh yeah	6 6	6 6
maybe two trips that were about four hours long	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
im im	3 1	3 1
it was the thing same problem	6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 2 4 4 4
you know it was easy	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
possibly what uh theyre theyre thinking about here more external peace corps	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
for target practicing and uh	6 7 5 6 6	6 6 4 4 6
or even making the play-offs	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
something that	3 1	6 6
see it it all it it all money	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
and maybe	6 6	6 6
you know a lot of people like	6 6 7 5 2 4 4	3 6 3 6 2 4 4
i think we had fish when i was a kid	3 6 3 6 2 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 2 4
did you not press one	6 3 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and it it too bad	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
scallops saint something	2 4 4	6 6 6
weve weve talked our five minutes though	3 1 6 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and if were were going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4
things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
so that that what i did	6 3 1 1 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
will will say theyll theyll say oh well our kids my kid	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
what kind of puppy you got	7 5 2 4 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
when i did this	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
you know and ive ive heard people say well you know it it just like the american civil war	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 4 6
and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you laughter-have	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4
are are powerful enough to take	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
theyve theyve started putting them1 up at the top	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
to see if you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
uh we can spend so much money on certain things but	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6
and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 2 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4
the year because1 my son gets that	2 4 6 2 4 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4
i come to think of it i do do think i went to the movies one time	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but ive ive lived in uh	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
day cares	2 4	6 6
youd youd have to be scared to death	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
go see a movie	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
that much of a difference	2 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 2 4
i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency youre youre using is incorrectly reporting the information that youre youre providing to them	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 1 2 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 4 3 3 1 6 6 6
losing big big money that	2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you know theyve theyve got it all figured out	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
all in all there are a lot worse climates than dallas uh	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
have drop off bins for	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
and the moody blues	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
our major crimes in our immediate town uh	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh see it it three	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
and ill ill get get stuff out of that	6 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 1
we do do take care of them	3 6 6 6 7 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
you would have- you would have	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
you know a great	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
and you know how do you tell your parent parent the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do care if youre youre president	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 2	3 6 6 6 3 6 1 6
so they were they were playing it very safe	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
but he must own the biggest chunk	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh newscaster that	2 4 3	6 6 6
can they convey the data	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
uh james taylor and	2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6
in fact	6 6	6 6
sometimes it is a difficult choice	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 4
and she she	6 3 1	6 6 6
so theyre theyre really going at it	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
in the first laughter-grade	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
but demanding that	6 6 6	6 6 6
im im a graduate student	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 6
i i think that we should be spending more time	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4
itll itll be a tough road to	6 6 6 7 5 5 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 3
oh for sure	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it mosquitoes are terrible	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and perhaps it it because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
and that that not their problem	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 4
yeah is um	3 6 6	6 6 6
the lincoln ride is certainly good too	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 4 6
we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality	3 6 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
uh people who come from cultures that do do have the same	2 4 3 2 4 7 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4
well you know really that that not world music	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
uh score enough runs to be able win in these uh in this day and age	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
strangely enough the best offer- i mean the best	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
they bloomed in the spring	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
uh let let see	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
whatever reason which is	2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6
they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to	3 6 7 5 3 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
or sensible or rational juror	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
i know	3 6	6 6
our red light district	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
everybody gets in draft	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
and the skunk was a good a decent pet but	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6
i do do know if they actually are fined or or what happens	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
so i called jc jc penney	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 4 6
kid had missed all these classes	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
maybe have uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that	2 3 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
uh two and a half baths	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6
oh uh im im im im sure this is the one time that the israelis are really	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i mean theyre theyre not helping anybody	6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 3 3 1 6 6 6
and a house full of snow and rain	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
they live lean for one thing	3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
it frightens me to think	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
so he started with the bb bb gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
ive ive uh	3 1 6	3 1 6
but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
officer- the arresting officer	6 2 4 4	6 2 4 4
defense winning- winning- winning all the games	7 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that that a bad tangent to get on	3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6
you know i have	6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
i was raised totally opposite	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i think they ought to take them1 and	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
capital punishment	3 1	6 6
then he eats it	6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6
it it very expensive to run	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
he should address those problems	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
that that my buzzer at the door	3 1 2 4 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and and it does does take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
but in urban areas it it laughter-you laughter-know	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
about seventy miles north of london	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 4 6 2 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
those onions	2 4	6 6
i do do notice it probably because i do	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the other thing that ive thought of on this is i wonder if there is is enough money	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i i mean you know there there is always that chance	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
i enjoyed the big family	3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4

the the same crime	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
those who do do vote if you made them vote	3 1 2 4 4 6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic	6 2 4 4 3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4

it it about time for one of those	6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
doing that	6 3	6 6

are you are you married	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4
uh having murders	6 6 2	6 6 6
i mean theyre theyre a it it a small market	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
but then you have to decide you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 6
do do they	6 6 3	3 1 6
is just that	6 6 6	6 6 6
have a more solid	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
but i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
im im sorry we had the experience of vietnam	3 1 6 3 6 2 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
because that was back in the seventies	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
in front	6 2	6 6
it can it can be fun i	6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
there there been a couple of other the people um	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
no idea-	6 6	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
but there are an awful lot of young people who would	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
what should they get in return i wonder	7 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
unless they stole it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 3
you probably could	6 6 6	6 6 6
i think if we wait	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4
but he was was there	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
they might have five hundred troubled youths	3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i read the grant takes command	3 6 2 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 4
the muted trumpet	2 4 4	3 6 6
like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library	6 6 2 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4

it it not like going to mit mit mit	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 6 3 1 4
or baltimore news	2 4 4	6 6 6

go together	6 6	6 6
really do	6 6	6 6
we were ranked pretty high up	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things	3 6 3 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 2 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4

we use it live in california	2 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4
if they see violence at home that that what youre youre going to	6 3 6 7 5 2 3 1 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6
i want to believe they go into other countries	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i- i just think that that that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
be able to take care of them	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
any of these the public uh stations you know	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6

which i really wanted to do	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
they do do get repealed as easily as they do	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
but they	6 6	6 6
and the catch broke	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
even though	6 6	6 6
i like jazz music	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
i would	6 6	6 6
teach in a small town down in south texas	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
and usually around the christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 4
or at least it seems that way	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6
you know light for underneath	6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
like i i made	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
but uh there there a bunch of scenes from uh	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
i mean that that that that the question	6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 4
lit them	6 3	6 6
and all of his teachers were very good	6 7 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst	3 6 7 5 2 4 6 2 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
where you work do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6
certainly were were a powerhouse uh	2 4 4 7 5 2	6 3 6 2 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
but i was wondering like you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and the backyard has two	6 2 4 6 2	6 2 4 4 4
and it was really fun	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
the things they carried	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
and then the iranian could could	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
it it hard to find movies that are are terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore	6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 6
it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
well just kill them1	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6

i do do ever hear it in the news here	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
even if it is you know the best thing in the long run	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4

in the public school systems in the state of texas and i think it it similar in in many other states	6 2 4 4 4 6 7 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4

over cost and then options at cost and everything	7 2 7 5 5 5 3 7 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4
curriculums that	2 6	6 6
uh you serve your prison term	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
but they did did have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know	6 3 6 6 6 3 7 3 1 7 5 5 5 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4

and uh it it a lot cheaper	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and it really it really added up	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and they and they mentioned that one	6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
two and half oh	3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6
or i do not mean responsibility- attachment and responsibility	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 4
talked to	6 6	6 6
information that you get from your child you know	7 3 1 7 5 2 4 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
that would be wonderful	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it now uh	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
if there there a door closed you open it because1 it it in your way	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
the rat race to exercise	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4
oh those are nice	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4
but the people continue to move back in the flood laughter-zones	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
i bet you it it kind of what i decided	3 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
the thing about camping that bothers me is youve youve got to pack everything	3 1 2 3 1 2 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 2 4 4
but i am sure that there are women who would would	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6
a little on the nutso side	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
and so	6 6	6 6
but i had decided long before	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
was about two years ago she got sick on me	6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
it it	6 6	3 1
but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
you pay	3 6	6 6
to find out and to- to see what they need and not overinflate it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6
know how to use them1	6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
basically donate to a goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
it it actually in better condition than my car	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
washington i think is uh	2 3 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 6
where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing	2 4 4 4 4 7 5 3 7 5 3 2 3	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
you know any controls	6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6
it it kind of hard to know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6 6
you know prior-	6 6 6	6 6 6
but it it kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
that- you know	3 6 7	6 6 6
their life expectancy was real short	2 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
toweling down her throat	7 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
there was a time when unions were needed	6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4
the salesman did did know	3 1 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6
and they had a centennial here awhile back	6 3 6 7 5 6 2 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6
and if youre youre a little bit claustrophobic	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
theyre theyre like uh preferring it now right	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that a hard one	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
im im	6 6	3 1
but i mean apparently we	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
criminal process system	2 4 4	6 6 6
it does does have any really the performance that the expensive one does	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
which of course again	6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4
to where they came from	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
that that a	3 1 2	3 1 6
and uh the green onions are coming along	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but housing is still real bad	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
but um it makes them crunchy	6 6 2 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and um i was concerned about the female mainly	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i our- our company company doing it	6 6 3 1 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
in the future	6 3 1	6 6 6
and they were playing in the back yard	6 2 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
put it together	6 3 6	6 6 6
but is	6 6	6 6
if you do do refute it as he did did	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
what you can do is you can	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it was	3 6	6 6
if they uh they test for drugs	6 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
ive ive lived in	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and see i live in an apartment	6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 6 4
and i and i imagine it it it	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
just just	6 6	6 6
indians play the red sox	2 4 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 4
and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
and they did did get across the river there	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you really ca ca	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the automotive-	6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 6 6 4
you know	6 6	6 6
you broke the rule	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
i still do do know that much about football obviously	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
from a more- far more disadvantaged viewpoint	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
or done their very you know given their best effort at doing that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
i well i do do because1 i work all day	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
so there are some some strides to be made there	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
he was a uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
im im laughter-not laughter-going laughter-up laughter-there	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4
and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4
down in that	6 6 2	6 6 6
or out of out of season clothes in them	2 4 4 4 4 7 2 6 3	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
programs seem to be a failure	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know the type of weather	6 6 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
do you have is it a fairly large house	6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
we were looking all these alternative sources of energy and so forth	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 7 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 4
i mean everything everything on the west side	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
i do too	3 6 6	6 6 6
or else they would have said something	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
and come down here	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
the one and only thing that that i can really put my finger on here	7 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 2 4 7 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
and maybe	6 6	6 6
im im just about to finish my masters masters in may	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6
that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on	2 4 4 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i know im im always scared of that whenever i go to a game	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
was was the same	6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6
and there was discussion	6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6
of the civil war	2 3 1 1	6 3 6 6
and ive ive and ive ive ive ive lived in that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and i thought well the loss that i would feel	6 3 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it it it fun to	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame	6 3 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 2 4
going after the hard degrees	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
it it	6 6	6 1
and here here what wrong	6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6
but it it so cheap	6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
some of the down side	7 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
that that the reason it ended up in a church because i mean there was just so many of them1	3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	3 1 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4

where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or	7 5 6 7 3 7 5 2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
what do you what do you think is causing all this	6 6 6 7 6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3
really true	6 6	6 6
im im really going head you know completely for it	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
is the the interviewing of jurors after the trial	6 6 2 4 7 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4
because i know that there	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i do do know what youd youd call it not premeditated or	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
i that that	6 6 6	6 6 6

he he got a	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6
it it gotten a little more difficult with kids	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
from massachusetts	7 2	6 6
but- you know they know it	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh uh ti ti also makes the	6 6 3 1 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and uh you could always catch a good news program at eight oclock or nine oclock on cnn cnn cnn	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 3 4 4
the teams that were there last year were	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
and that that why i know	6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
every time you	7 5 3	6 6 6
is warranted	6 6	6 6
but she was always	6 3 6 6	6 3 4 4
i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
when he went camping last year in beavers bend	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
im im not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
but i mean i i definitely agree with you	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
doggone it	6 6	6 3
and yet uh more people die of it	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it state supported	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
like being finger printed	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
thank you very much	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
so that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
and we took the car up to um a little place called pep boys	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
it looks like it would be uh	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i am too one hundred percent	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
they start raising taxes for property	3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
uh we have one	6 7 6 7	6 6 6 6
but what what it worth	6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
two of kids of my own i just do do have time	7 5 5 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
when the days start getting a little longer you know you can	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
booked up	6 6	6 6
the mentality north	7 5 5	3 6 6
that that uh same	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
i think voters are motivated	3 6 2 6 6	3 6 6 6 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
it it the same thing like the whole	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 6 4 6 4
which crimes do you feel that	2 4 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
so many of the kids that are	7 5 2 7 5 3 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at	6 6 2 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 3
and they last a long time	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6
and that that not	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
it kind of reminds me of	3 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 2 4 6 6
hell gives me kisses	3 6 3 7	6 6 6 6
i mean some i think some people that had fairly sturdy	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
and that that probably my question is how	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and different areas	7 2 4	6 6 6
we started	3 6	6 6
i got to wait for a place to	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
when you have a hundred here everybody everybody dying	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4
oh i do too	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
i think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that were so hateful towards the united states have come away with uh kind of a different attitude	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	3 6
now i have got some daffodils	6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
were were kind of	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
that that one thing	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
it was a tragic mistake	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
to go out to frederick i just jump on the interstate	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
active duty	7 5	6 6
it it it it not	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
those who were watching it how easily	2 3 2 4 3 7 5	6 6 2 4 4 4 4
we can recycle uh clear glass brown glass green glass	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
you know the differences between seventy and seventy	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the roof was really sorry	3 1 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
it is not a perennial	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment	6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
people people stand outside their houses and their watch the creeks foam brown and all	6 2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4 6 6
he he refuted it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 3
and all this kind of stuff id id say probably the	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 7	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
i was it was just driving me crazy	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
and it was sort of a	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
it it not new	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
that that interesting	3 1 6	3 1 6
and um	6 6	6 6
you know they they support drug habits with uh	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
by the time i was in	6 2 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 6
the cost of committing the crime slightly higher	7 5 5 5 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6

as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money	6 2 4 3 2 6 2 4 4 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted	7 5 6 2 4 7 5 5 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4
that we made	3 1 2	6 3 6

i know	3 6	6 6
when i was in grad school	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 4

some talk about that in this in in my state	7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and the air force is one of the bitter better military	6 3 1 1 6 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 4 6 4
if you look at	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in five years when they get bigger itll itll work a little bit more too	6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
were were harsher	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
it is	3 6	6 6
you know i do do know for if youre youre familiar with that or not	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
oh yes	6 6	6 6
my kid is banging	3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6
basically go out the window	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4
why why you even telling me this	6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but it really keeps	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
the election	6 6	6 6
and it was rough	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
and you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
way back in there	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
or at least ours does	6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
weaned off of it	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
plan them a month in advance	6 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and people said well they uh young people who were drafted have to	6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6
there there is no well defined mechanism at all	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
i do do	6 6 6	6 6 6
and what happens if it you know if it if they catch it	6 7 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6
what changes do you feel	7 5 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4
that one was was that great either	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and then it it solid rock from then on down	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
i also thought about it	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
my wife left me my dog left me you know	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
miles per hour	2 4 7	6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
oh hybrid teas	6 2 4	6 6 6
well i know	6 6 6	6 6 6
i mean in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
youre youre a student	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
get it for all it is worth	6 2 6 7 3 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
well uh i originally came from saint louis	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i think it has got to be an individual	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
uh when that beagle passed away	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
i mean just just scratching two or three inches was just a chore	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
enjoy some of the michael j fox movies	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
from- from that aspect youre youre right	6 6 2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and it it wonderful	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
what your credit report looked like	3 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 6
for me i would would have time to	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and so i hardly ever	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
i just have a feeling that the military involvement is is over yet	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 3 4 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
had the final say	2 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
it was sort of like there were boundaries	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and they had a real good time	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
they had some other expenses that came up	2 6 7 5 5 3 7 5	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
well it depends where in dallas you are	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
washington it really is a uh	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 4 4 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
the the cockatoos are those the big ones	6 2 4 6 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4
so he considered himself to be you know	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
go down to the sheriff sheriff office and get fingerprinted	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 4
and right	6 6	6 6
and it	6 6	6 6
but if they were	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4
you know i really- you know if i had to put someone in there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
almost four and a a two year old	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
in prison	6 2	6 6
right on her neck	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
that that what we do especially when it it bad weather man just	3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 6
but san antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
and there there not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
weve weve there are certain things to do	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4
at least in california theyre theyre supposed to be	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
probably not	6 6	6 6
go ahead	6 6	6 6
i were were were were new to iowa	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
theyre theyre	3 1	3 1
that our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of um people	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
um they	6 6	6 6
oh i know	6 3 6	6 6 6
so if it it your peers and youre youre not educated	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program	6 2 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 2 4 7 5 5 5 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and you do do	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
in texas	7 2	6 6
statistics and everything	7 6 3	6 6 6
crimes are done with	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and it was kind of fun	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
i really can	3 6 6	6 6 6
wrote and asked for material	6 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
it would get snatched laughter-right off your arm	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and and along with that you know	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 1
a uh	6 6	6 6
oh i do do think there are any	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some	6 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
is is that funny	6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
ive ive heard very positive things about atlanta	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 3	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
so i do do know what you know what can be done	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well uh pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard	6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 6 2 7 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4
and he did pull out before it got any further than that where where it would have turned into more of a police action	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean you can you can see the crime stoppers ads on television	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
i mean you can see the house from	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
effort or whatever going on	7 5 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
were were set	7 5 6	3 1 6
it is like	6 6 6	6 6 6
and he had never really thought about it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3
uh in the church	6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4
you can make it either tight	3 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
you know	3 6	6 6
with ink	6 7	6 6
you definitely do do have laughter-time	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
young people see on television and the movies	7 5 2 4 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
i think it is getting worse because1 i keep hearing things	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
and im im just like oh my gosh	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and uh i had sandy loam hauled in	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
it just you know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
much more crime than ever before	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise	3 6 6 6 3 2 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
a lot of	7 5 6	6 6 3
youll youll have nightmares you know	3 1 6 2 6 6	3 1 2 4 6 6
and laughter-i did did like him	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6

and i	6 6	6 6
that that usually pretty good	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
somebody want do that-	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre a lot	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
those are	3 6	6 3
on a regular basis	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble	7 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
and i think with uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6

you know physically ruined themselves	6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 4 4
it it called burgundy meatballs	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
and he said ill ill sell that snake to you for two fifty	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
what are your views	7 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
as a fit person	6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6
no matter what it is if it it a limited edition it it usually worth something later on	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
that that not	3 1 6	3 1 6
kind of thought that too	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and theyre theyre so expensive to start up	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
itll itll be three years in august	6 6 6 3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
were clean	6 6	6 6
that you ca ca you ca ca remove the jury regardless of the case	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
or uh uh just- just for the sake of argument im im taking the	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6
i think ive ive seen two around dallas	3 6 3 1 6 7 6 2	6 3 3 1 6 6 4 4
i i really do do enjoy doing that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
it to me	6 6 3	6 6 6
uh crimes that they	2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6
like i said it it it it still not practical for laughter-me	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
and uh that that that gets to be uh	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
that that fun you know	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and it it you know it it killed several people	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6
youre youre gonna gonna have a lot of more choices	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 1 6 3 1 6 6 4
i um	6 6	6 6
uh theyre theyre outrageous	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and the ones in in the diesel cars were	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
no remorse what so ever	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
we threatened to make the other two	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
for instance one of the things they do at uh my kids school	6 6 7 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
neither i mean there there plans there	6 6 6 6 6 7 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
but i	6 6	6 6
it just comes out of the bible	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
a lower income bracket where they do do pay as much and they cancel part of your	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
well ill bet you therere therere a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 2 4 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 4
no- yeah that is a scary thought	6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
like to me i do do	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6
or you became a ward of somebody	6 3 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
all kinds of evidence	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i guess the biggest one is	3 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 6
i think um	3 6 6	3 6 6
i thought so too	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh you know just just i think an over simplification	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6
in fact they we just had a lay off in what november i guess	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 2 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
and she winds up being a a victim	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4
uh well no	6 6 6	6 6 6
laughter-because that that all there is to it	6 3 1 7 6 7 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
but im im getting- and im im getting much better at it	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and then i was um i decided well i like this author	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
problem came in you know	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6

i do	3 6	6 6
if you continue taking drugs	6 3 6 6 2	6 6 4 4 6

and they came and questioned us	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 4 6
you know stuff like that	6 7 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 6
so you know they they sort of come with the	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
and uh but i think that they should be in harmony	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
let let see eleven years old	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
when the thing has has won any award	6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 4
it it it it all money based	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 4
and im im im im	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
i did did know	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
im im a im im a scoutmaster	6 6 6 3 1 7 5	3 1 3 6 6 6 4
missile which was the the tv tv laser guided bombs	2 3 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
so it was	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that the neatest book weve weve got	3 1 2 4 4 3 1 2	3 1 2 4 4 3 1 6
first identify myself as middle aged	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 4 6

i have a friend who um	3 6 7 5 3 6	3 6 2 4 4 4
little buds-	2 4	6 6
the tourism in one town	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
but for the population as a whole i sort of feel that way	6 6 2 4 4 7 5 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6
the prosecutor will want to	2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
and i think it would would hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
theyre theyre kind- theyre theyre kind of like the bush roses	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh southeast asia and lots of	2 4 4 4 7 2	6 6 4 4 6 6
criminal cases are	3 1 6	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i do believe that that in	3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
i weve weve got weve weve got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
most of the time when you see bus	6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
there you go	6 3 6	6 6 6
they are	3 6	6 3
like here in atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
for example	6 6	6 6
and of course the kids say	6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 2 4 4
theyve theyve got um in most of the states around here i think uh	3 1 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6
well ill ill let you go	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6

it it right	3 1 6	3 1 6
plano plano doing real good on that	2 4 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
im im not sure though whether i feel	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
about a year ago	2 7 5 2	6 3 6 6
and i was was really involved in the the	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
well what about the idea that one is only guilty uh when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt	6 7 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 4
ridiculous things	7 5	6 6
you know i wear slacks year round except	6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh we usually sit there unless somebody laughter-gives laughter-us tickets you know box seats or something	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 2 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4
i just like willie nelson i guess because1 he he such a character	3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
it it the only way that you can use television effectively	3 1 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
um i have have really talked to anybody that that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them	3 1 6 6 7 5 2 7 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 3
them to be let out early	3 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
well i mean it seems to me that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
but teachers are asked to diagnose so much	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
take the grill out and the radiator out	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
ive ive got a six year old now	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 4 4
her father was murdered	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
it was like oh that could be it	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
and just blew everything off in the middle of the night	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
it it very safe in the daytime	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
well i lived in africa for a couple years in	6 3 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
out of each child	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
do to some degree	6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6
younger people	2 4	6 6
maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
but to me their their not that big enough for a pool	6 6 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
what i read when the	3 1 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6
any jury jury not going to disregard the evidence you know	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6

i was thinking i might be minor league	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
lots of vegetables and hors doeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 1	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4

my only experience with it i was in central america for a while and uh in san salvador in el salvador	2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4

just wanted the degree	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
the only thing about the death penalty and and- i know that	2 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6
but i- i do do really think those things happen too often because	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
anyway do you have children	6 6 3 6 7	6 3 1 6 6

well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings	6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4
there there no need for someone who who soliciting should know it all	6 6 7 5 5 3 1 1 2 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and you think to yourself was it that bad back then	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6
it decided that	3 6 6	6 6 6
whole roosevelt administration was uh	7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6

that that is true	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and scholarships	2 4	6 6

through the fall too	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
i was much younger at the time	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i just to diverge a little bit	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6

that that that that interesting	6 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 1 6
it was zales jewelry in fact	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
but uh he did did carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
can uh	6 6	6 6
it was very-	3 6 6	6 6 6
is that done	6 3 6	3 6 6
well maybe because it it outside of dallas they are giving a little bit better	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4 3 1 6 4
and im im in the van you know uh two hours a day	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i wish i could be that way	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
like cutesy	6 6	6 6
um brian dennehe	2 4 4	6 6 6
so maybe that counts	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
you know sporty and class uh	6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
there really needs to be a bridge	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i know	3 6	6 6
i i	6 6	6 6
well it it been nice talking to you	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i i do watch that one	6 3 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 3
definitely agree with you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
what kind of square footage	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
boy you have to really have your car winterized and stuff	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
then i started cleaning	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and then the judge says oh no	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
well i do do either	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well is the crime that bad there in atlanta	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4
mine had been a a a	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
well um i	6 6 6	6 6 6
sentencing by jury	2 4 3	6 6 6
and the youngest is twenty	6 2 4 6 7	6 3 6 6 4
of course it it a little hard to tell from	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 2 4 4
this is a holy war	2 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
and then	6 6	6 6
so i really really like that	6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh once they have that then they can start	6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
so he gave them to alan	6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
is it is it uh just a small group of the employees that are	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
and looked around	6 6 6	6 6 6
all right	6 6	6 6
society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
it it it it just	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
something for a kid	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
you could a get a four hundred small block four hundred that was uh	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
oh im im sure he is	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
do you think	6 6 6	6 6 6
i live i live in plano	6 6 3 6 6 2	3 6 6 2 4 4
lot of snow and a lot of cold	7 2 4 4 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 4
buy a condominium	7 2 4	6 3 6
it it twelve years old	2 4 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
whatever it is to to you know break this uh	3 1 7 5 5 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
ive ive had some from plano too	3 1 6 7 2 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
i do do know replace some of the belts	6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
or is that just the	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know plenty about planning a budget- a budget	6 6 7 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and so they figure why go out and vote you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
but uh they managed to get through although	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it was it was a big western	6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 2 4 4
to come in and live with them1	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
at at the ti ti there i said is there any area i should avoid	6 6 3 1 1 2 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
just very little variation from there	6 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
he he he	6 3 1	6 6 6
maybe we went in to be policeman	6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies you know	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6
because the way i feel is if i do do vote	6 2 4 3 2 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
are are you in baltimore itself	6 6 3 6 2 3	6 3 6 6 4 4
but uh you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
you know to	6 6 6	6 6 6
and then you had a family	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
it seems to me that it still should	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 3 1 6
well and that i think that that maybe part of it that that the	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
bryn mawr stereo dealer	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them1 or get you off of them1 because	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that laughter-youre laughter-youre laughter-a laughter-real danger to them	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
oh lovely	6 6	6 6
so yes	6 6	6 6
it it	6 6	3 1
you know it	3 6 3	6 6 6
my toyota did really well	3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and you know youd youd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 3 2 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
really make uh make a mess	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
did you	6 3	6 6
i think that that um	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 6 6
but you know that that just my	6 6 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh if you read it	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
a real dog and cat	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
to put in the state budget	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
that were in the dumpsters	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
it it big	3 1 6	3 1 6
soviet system was put together under total force you know	2 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6
i do do think any kid should be exempt from being spanked	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
a small amount of money and they	7 5 5 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
but she she she gone three mornings	6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
uh never seem to	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
to a videotaping they were doing	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
because he was around with a crowd of kids	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
two three weeks ago	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
oh dear	6 6	6 6
it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
give incentives like uh	6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
teaches teaches a lot	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
and they uh always	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
no morals	2 4	6 6
up in denton	7 5 2	6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
unlike like like a city like san diego it seems- it just has a really bad problem	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
but that will be it	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
tell him to do it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
we beat buffalo in in and	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
be a large variation in	6 7 5 5 2	6 3 6 6 6
that that too bad	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
great big uh spruce and and an oak tree all about	2 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
big pluses for working for a large organization and also the uh	7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
that that one of the things weve weve been fortunate with is our wiring been okay	3 1 7 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
a jacuzzi and sauna and	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
but uh it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
where mothers are working all the time and	2 4 4 4 7 5 5 2	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
how about1 you	6 6 3	6 6 6
theyve theyve only just really started as far as the environment saying okay were were really going to get involved	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
you threw that question on me about the deficit	3 6 2 4 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
which i thought was kind of interesting	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
and that one was just a very poignant story	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
it it outrageous- it it outrageous to go to the cowboy game	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i guess that that what i am concerned with	6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
i do	3 6	6 6
and so you do do want to get caught in the parking garage	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
you there there only so much football you can watch	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and that is uh and	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
but i know that that helps a lot with training and um	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
are you satisfied with the quality of coverage	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
well uh	6 6	6 6
and then i usually end up flipping through cnn cnn cnn and headline news	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 3 1	3 6 2 6 6 6 4 4 3 6 4 6 4 4
well there there not much i can do about it	6 6 6 6 7 3 7 5 5 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
it was	6 6	6 6
let let put it this way	6 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 4
i do do know how they do it	3 6 6 6 6 2 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
except our outside	6 6 6	6 6 6
but it it a dry heat yeah	6 6 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh i	6 6 3	6 6 3
he was- he was involved in another one another capital murder	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
uh and shooting a uh policeman	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
that was a movie too was was it	3 6 7 5 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but in the afternoon uh	6 6 2 4 6	3 6 2 4 4
here in in dennison	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
you know there there there there not enough	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
there there a lot more women in the work place nowadays	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
you know it because it was by stephen king it would be really gory	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know as is needed	6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
or whether there there just you know a policeman has just made a uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 6 4
that that what were were doing	3 1 1 1 1 6	3 1 3 6 6 6
from the target	6 7 5	6 6 6
i think that uh it it it it kind of like uh good entertainment	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4
so that that an interesting	6 3 1 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
you know it-	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it it it it it just the you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
stuff like that	2 4 3	6 6 3
it it just a problem that problem-	6 6 6 2 4 3 2	3 1 6 6 4 6 3
i just hate that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
which have have changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it but uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
id id i did did see it	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 1 3 6 6 6 6
but theyre theyre really looking for someone who will	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
so serious you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but our honda just got old and just wore out	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
so if you	6 6 3	6 6 6
i think i think i perceive the fact	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4
there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6
how about you	6 6 3	6 6 6
and all this stuff is seeping through to the water	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
put at	2 4	6 6
uh with just malicious intent	2 4 7 5 5	6 6 4 4 4
and you know theyre theyre not making them like that now	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
august- august till the water warms laughter-up	6 2 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know	6 7	6 6
and it was only like	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but it	6 6	6 6
let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you would- you know	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 1 2 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
by law and by constitution there must be	6 7 6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
uh quite honestly i i have some little children	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
congress senate and the the presidency	3 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
god knows what	2 6 3	6 6 6
im im	6 6	3 1
although it it settles you know	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
gets lethal injection and who does does	2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 4
there there a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4
traded it in on the chevy van	6 3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 3 6 4 6
and i really enjoy it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
disqualified- were disqualified	6 6 6	6 6 6
it would make it would make life easier	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 4 4
treated very badly	6 6 6	6 6 6
do you need somebody to go off for	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i come up to you and i just point blank	3 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
seem like theyre theyre doing much with it	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
but it it used	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
and there was a lake	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 2 4
it it a dog eat dog world	3 1 7 6 7 6 7	3 1 2 4 6 4 4
well ill ill have to catch it one of these days	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 7 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
there there a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 2 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 6 4
messed up on me	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
that that the problem	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
so that that i think that is good that theyre theyre like that	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6
because it it support people that are providing the speed for it	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 6
especially if you get forget to record those little suckers	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
a lot of	7 5 2	6 6 6
what what more likely to occur is uh	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
oh well-	6 6	6 6
well see the other way im im thinking about is they should be self-supporting like	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
well that does does	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
still growing in in containers	6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 4
our community does does really have any organized	2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
whenever you donate money to someone	6 3 6 2 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4
then somebody you know before youre youre you you start penalizing them1 with bad grades for not being able to communicate what theyre theyre thinking	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 2 4 6 3 1 6
uh you just were were just happy that there there trees already there so far	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 1 6 4 4 4 4
and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor	6 7 5 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 4 4 4 4
it it just it it the morals of the people which	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i took the baby	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
there there some snickering about it	6 6 7 5 5 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
and i mean it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
well i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
oh here we go again folks kind of stuff	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
holy cow	6 6	6 6
it tastes so good	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
i said uh i could could do this everyday	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
ours is the same	3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
well and	6 6	6 6
i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
i i think you know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
uh dwells on a fact that	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6
i do do know what that would be	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
i would would say it it as bad as new york	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
not too far	6 6 6	6 6 6
but for aluminum that that real nice	6 6 2 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and so if the car sucks in	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class	3 1 7 5 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt and tennis shoes	6 3 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
are they going to move to uh mexico	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
snow does does happen very often	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
and they had it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
and then they go to their coaching	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
it it really beautiful	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
pretty funny how often i know	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i i figured maybe id id get one or two years out of it	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 3
it really is	3 6 6	6 6 6
or if theyre theyre	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
vehicles and not just cars but also	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and and but of course most time most the time management has a hard time	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 4 6 6 6 6 4
my dad does laughter-it laughter-all laughter-for laughter-me	2 4 6 3 7 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
what year	7 5	6 6
i think it was uh	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
then a couple of weeks later we got we got pin numbers	6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
one thing my wife and ive ive talked about it are uh private schools	2 4 3 1 1 1 1 2 4 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
a society where a certain percentage of the parents are	2 4 4 7 5 5 2 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
and uncle sam took me out took me hunting with him	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
but i was	6 6 6	6 3 6
invaded in my privacy relative to this second	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
and im im thirty years old	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
of the administrators	2 4 4	6 3 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
he has pulled out	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh as far as tellers and things like that it it not extremely high either	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4
i just tell the credit card company do do pay the charge even though theyve theyve already paid it	3 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i guess kind of homey	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
i do do want to be responsible for it because	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
i think the what was national rifle association uh had this bumper sticker a few years back if uh	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 4 4 4
because1 uh	6 6	6 6
and in texas there there there there a couple of questions you have to ask	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 2 4
i bought us tickets and stood there in line	3 6 3 7 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
while my	6 2	6 6
and then they	6 6 6	6 6 6
was there nineteen of them or	6 6 7 2 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh im im aware of other people smoking now	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
you know it it just them there they are	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was walter cronkite	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
that that would happen if you did that	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i do do think they do the packaging at this plant	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
well uh	6 6	6 6
so im im like that that the last major purchase for this thing	6 3 1 6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6

you know put him in jail for the rest of his life	6 6 6 3 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
went and took the car	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
-before it rains again	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree	6 6 2 4 3 2 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
you can only laugh	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
were were just returning the computer	3 1 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh let let see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force	2 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
i mean is	6 6 6	6 6 6
i i do do mean older um you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
maybe so	6 6	6 6
so you know if	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
youre youre going to have it	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
be in that atmosphere	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
to execute- execute this guy	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
and besides you know if corn did did grow there	6 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
the the the iowa cubs	6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated	6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
work ethic	7 5	6 6
and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we did did support that	2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 6
i do do see how anything can survive out there	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
ive ive never visited baltimore	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6
you know just	6 6 6	3 6 6
well the thing id id be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence	6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 6 4
the soviet threat i guess was perceived as being	2 4 4 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
it it it it	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
it was just a matter of who was shot that night	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
i know	3 6	6 6
your opponent	2 4	6 6
you can wander	3 6 6	6 6 6
i think that was a cover-	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
but then i	6 6 3	6 6 6
so now my dad dad paying for all of my college	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 7 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
and then you might have more control over	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4
but it it going to	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i mean did you have to draw a line	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
equally dismal	6 6	6 6
and it was just so wonderful	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
oh several of our rooms got ruined	6 7 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school	3 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it	6 6 7 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
i would go faithfully	3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4
it does does	3 6 6	3 6 6
they started marketing it in	3 6 6 2 6	3 6 6 6 6
theyve theyve got people working some serious equipment	3 1 6 2 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
and i work with a lot of them1	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i just need	3 6 6	3 6 6
you may be shot for holding one	3 6 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
and then another another one will jump up	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh pretty much up until	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 4
this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3
i ca ca remember where the other one lives	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your laughter-leotards	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
that youre youre automatically	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
i mean were were alerted to what the moment we see something	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
up until you know recently where she she been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 7 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 3 6 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4
a free	7 5	3 6
they got thrown right into the total mainstream	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
what what the right word the varied	7 5 5 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
then you would put you would have put that down on the list	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6
kind of	6 6	6 6
he was was the star but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in uh	3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 6
you know overkill	6 6 7	6 6 6
half of it	7 2 4	6 6 6
because1 i live just south of the interstate	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4

i mean i mean were were have to be	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3
and in that country it it a duty to pay taxes	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4 2 4 4
or something	6 6	6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
gets unequal sentences	6 2 4	6 6 6
i agree with that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
by the phone and all that	6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and thatll thatll help the country eventually too because	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
well that that neat	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
and they said the record showed i served	6 3 6 7 5 6 3 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4
little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6
the money to pay for it	2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
last week	2 4	6 6
uh you know lawyers these lawyer groups	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
sounds like im im bragging	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6

you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
well that that that	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
or a fifth of	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
not just exercise but	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
when you finally	6 3 6	6 6 6
who who was that with	6 7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
and also too i think im im im im tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 3 1 6 4 4

all you have	7 3 6	6 6 6
criminal courts	3 1	6 6
so that that going up	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
ive ive become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very	3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
picking up the garbage or educating our kids	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4
unless you have something to do with it	6 3 6 3 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and have me uh you know go through this this thing you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6

my mother has one	3 1 6 7	6 6 6 6
of our uh people are voting	2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4

the good job in the past	2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
it it it it sad though that um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
so you got to give them1 either more time in the system	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
that even	6 6	6 6

what do you think you would offer as far as uh	7 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 4
that no one knows about	3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
but that that uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and this session is about to run out	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6

to cut your lawn without a bag	6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
you know if youve youve been tested at other companies and youve youve always come up negative or whatever then	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 4 2 4 6

that that good	3 1 6	3 1 6
ive ive heard of that one	3 1 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
so i think it	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
are you ready	6 3 6	6 6 6
i did did know how to work the machine you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3
we had	6 6	6 6
laughter-you laughter-know	6 6	6 6
and then the student teacher did did stay but about six weeks	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 3 4 6 6 4 4 4
it would be	3 6 6	6 6 6
but i was thinking boy in dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you would would go by yourself at night id id have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 6 2 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
i like costner a lot	3 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 3
we you know we do have the random drug testing	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
one that uh just gave me the pin number automatically	7 3 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
furrows i guess to buy his paint	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i mean-	6 6	6 6
and it was really fairly easy	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
it was starting to burn some oil	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
she was off drugs and everything	3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know yourself	6 6 6	6 6 6
it uh	6 6	6 6
im im glad the parents won	3 1 6 3 1 6	3 1 6 6 4 4
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
in fact i have been real disappointed in the six years that ive ive lived out here about lot sizes	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 1 7 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
doing a good job of it	6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
now if he comes in and says you know ill ill repair your your vcr vcr vcr or somebody else else vcr vcr vcr for a hundred dollars	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 4 6 2 4 4
well my children are about in the same age bracket	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
oh well theyll theyll weed him out	6 6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
it- it really is coming to that because most women	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i i personally think life imprisonment	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4 4
when a jury makes a decision	6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
yellow peppers huh	2 4 6	6 6 6
the only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say weve weve had enough of you	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
now that that another one i wanted to see	6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
purple buddy	3 1	6 6
you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i guess bad guys if you want to call them1 bad guys they are going to get a gun no matter what	3 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
something that they turn back	3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 4 4
we were getting ready to leave	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
it was after	6 6 6	6 6 6
so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from south africa	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but that purple ball	6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6
bizmart the other day	2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4
oh you did	6 3 6	6 6 6
i would would mind doing it at forty	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
now i	6 6	6 6
because it it dirty and it needs to be cleaned	6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
the uh	6 6	6 6
this is	2 4	6 6
in the strictest sense of the uh	2 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
change fast	6 6	6 6
theyre theyre not willing to you know to put that you know	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but i i do kind of like to know what what going on and what what happening	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 3 1 6
there are times when	6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
i say agree with you a hundred laughter-percent laughter-there	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and i understand that that a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television	6 3 6 3 1 7 5 5 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 2 4
and he he out	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
you know when i hear about things like	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
changing the spark plugs	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 4
you know pool and decking	6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6
because1 i do like the i like the plant in the spring	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
but i would like to see them have	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
oh people	6 2	6 6
it it uh	6 6 6	3 1 6
or eighty	2 4	6 6
well what what what theyve theyve been able to do is slow down the rate of increase	6 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
all right	6 6	6 6
my husband is always you know talked about	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 6
well that that easy	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
more fun things to do	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
revenue they can get	2 3 2 4	6 3 6 6
and i found that a particularly useless way of studying	6 3 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 4
i was really	3 6 6	6 6 6
in other words	6 2 4	6 6 6
enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system	7 5 6 6 3 1 1 7 2 4 4 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
it it the story of this little cat and dog	3 1 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
from one to ten what my number would be	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6
and uh and i think that that good	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6
it seems about1	3 6 6	6 6 6
and that that that	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
theyre theyre theyre theyre lean-to	6 6 3 1 2	3 1 3 1 6
so uh i think the jury selection process is pretty neat	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
the station finally	2 4 6	6 6 6
well i think i would start with	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
my uh	6 6	6 6
take care	6 7	6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i just	3 6	6 6
the uh wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order	7 5 5 5 2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
nursery rhyme music here lately	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i think the royals will	3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 4 4
okay uh	6 6	6 6
are problems um	7 2 4	6 6 6
by administrator i- i think i mean	6 2 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh the- the epa epa epa	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops	3 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
now this one was purebred	6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and i hope maybe were were going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
really do do have a basis in in uh politics or or human rights or anything like that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 2 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
you may have	3 6 6	6 6 6
oh boy	6 6	6 6
you know it it silly not to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i assume it it the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do	3 6 3 1 7 5 2 4 3 1 2 7 5 2	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
oh well that im im not so sure about	6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
uh in fact i know the school districts down here	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 3 1 2 4 6 4 4
and im im wondering if uh	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
in our house for a long time was that	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
and uh i im im just going to keep holding off	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
im im glad to hear that wendy	3 1 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
but you know it it in the bleachers way out in the you know center field	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
no- no	6 6	6 6
or art	2 4	6 6
can make a difference	6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4

what are you saying	7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
uh testing	6 6	6 6
and that was pretty much it	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
things that need to be done	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
because i waited too late to really plant stuff	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
if i were arrested- let let say i were arrested falsely or not	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and theyre theyre the father of the country and all this	6 3 1 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and i	6 6	6 6
sort of in in iowa is that	2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
you know um	6 6 6	6 6 6
in germany or in	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 3
and then they throw it out and get something else you know	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
third- you know twice before	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
i think he won cy year uh two out of three years	3 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
you can do much better	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you know putting them1 in prison my god that does does work	6 6 6 2 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 3 1 6
let let see	6 6 6	3 1 6
theyre theyre	2 4	6 1
just uh	7 5	6 6
and we had that darn pet skunk	6 3 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
so he went out	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
involved at all	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that what i wish i had	3 1 1 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 4
the problem is not	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i do do know how many others are	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
uh i think i think there really is a there there a lot they need to learn	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6 2 4
we have two big dogs in the backyard i always	3 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
im im not really sure what	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
are trying to save the people from	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
just because they have to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
so i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
or was was or was that reagan	6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
or or we can do something about it	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
youre youre youre not past due until the fifteenth of the next month	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
someone new coming in you do do	2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
set up that way	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
and a woman asked me what that meant	6 7 5 6 3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 4
brian play here in the back yard	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
because it it right in the middle of fort worth	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and then it has little rooms off of it where you know youd youd go and sleep at night time	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 6
teach your children on an individual basis	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
and it may be you know it it not feasible to do everyone	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
the in plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content	6 6 7 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4

how do you feel about that lenore	6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
but it- it it it it i do do think it it any different of a problem than any other major city	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 3 1 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
i was so mad i got up and went and called	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and this would give them a chance to have some positive self	6 3 6 6 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6
im im doing an internship up at honeywell	3 1 6 7 5 6 6 2	3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4

and then i was told by somebody that works for jc jc penney penney that um	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 3 4 4 4
it it awful	6 6 6	3 1 6
when it starts costing you	6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
bothered with the news because it it all so bad	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4

which is more intrusive because i have to really tell someone to go away	3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4

i had a toyota	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
ill ill agree to that	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6
everything else is pretty standard	3 2 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
robert de niro	3 1 1	6 6 6
they might as well have not even been there	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
it it interesting	6 6 6	3 1 6
you know you just think you know where where the justice here	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6
yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
he he not going to get any better you know	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
go to the school youd youd like to go to	6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and it just	6 3 6	6 6 6
somehow or another theyll theyll give you an option to leave a message	6 6 2 3 1 6 3 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
but he he always a lot of fun in every movie he he in	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
do you ever go see the rangers	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
or is he a problem child	6 6 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4
i ca ca really watch television if the pattern is very intricate	3 6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
that that not really democratic	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
uh tomatoes that are starting to bloom	6 2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre always up where they do do where theyre theyre not supposed to be	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and then it it too late to try to change them around at that point	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4
i was too	3 6 6	6 6 6

uh no	6 6	6 6
they essentially give you the offer	3 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
they want to see all the horror movies	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4
i mean uh sure	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
with all these lawsuits and	6 2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6
there there two gates that go into the back yard	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 1 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
well that that true	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
but that that	6 6 6	6 6 6
i mean it just blew me away	6 6 3 6 6 3 6	3 6 2 4 6 6 4
they encourage it	3 6 3	6 6 6
i think there are i mean there there an institutional memory that you need to maintain	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 2 4
very much	6 6	6 6

i realized no i i really wanted this	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
well he is just he is really active still politically	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and i do not know if i have solutions except except to	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
but when you get two strikes on you you have a tendency- you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit	6 6 3 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 3 4 6
well a lot of states do do have capital punishment	6 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
this thing came on where these	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
he he a very odd odd man	3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 4 4
that cause problems	3 6 2	6 6 6

were were about done	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and uh	7 5	6 6
i mean ive ive got to see	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
enough to make it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
because1 diesel oil is uh	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 4 4 6
but even there there a couple public schools in dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4

laughter-experience laughter-to	2 4	6 6
and it it all this	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i did not get the traction control which also when you take the control- traction control and the	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 2 4 3 2 3 1 1 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
the bills eagles game which appropriately enough	2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
those that work for the the higher executives those secretaries	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4

it it	6 6	3 1
or jewish	6 6	6 6
my sociology class at smu smu smu smu taught us that it was not a deterrent	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 7 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
i just remember they have some funny stories	3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
it was pretty wild	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
up in uh	2 4 4	6 6 6
and here we are wasting	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
do you have pets	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
i mean if he he gonna gonna be drastic somebody has to be drastic back	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i think if if uh	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
because you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
how are you	6 6 3	6 6 6
in math	2 3	6 6
and you see you know fourteen year old kids flaunting money because1 their parents give them1 money to go down and play video games all night you know	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 6 7 5 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 3
and they go oh do you want to go again	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
it it not it it	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
bring them1 bringing them in as puppies	6 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre going crazy	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
that that statistic i guess has been growing every year	6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
rather than a home	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4
state school	2 4	6 6
but is it	6 6 6	6 6 3
i saw it you know i saw part of it again	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
testing procedures need to be defined a little better	2 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6
you know not guilty-	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
work for a consulting project	7 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4

credit cards for college students	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
ive ive probably seen it though	3 1 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
but i remember carter	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6
and there there there there a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 3 1	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4
and they went	6 3 6	6 6 6
when you	6 3	6 6
but there there so many things that it would make a difference	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
tires need to be replaced	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6

of the horses	6 3 1	6 6 6
uh let let see	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
i could see sort having maybe some of the tropical fish	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it like a half a liter or something like that	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4 6
somewhat that	6 3	6 6
the defect	2 4	6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 3
and those things just keep ticking	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
oh that sounds really neat	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
uh you know	6 6 6	6 6 3
what do you usually wear to work	7 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
he he already been	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
the math and the science	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
the fact that your machine being fed information to to learn how to learn	7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
it has to be even uh	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
to the vet vet because she was was eating	6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
i mean-	6 6	6 6
up here in new england uh where ive ive	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
but uh again uh that did did occur without a crisis	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 4 6 6 3 4 6 6 2 4
she only taught there one year	3 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
is is that what youre youre talking about women working out of their homes	6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
the current crime	2 4 4	6 6 6
tossing everything away which i always felt bad about	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all americans	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
thought about getting one	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
were were going to get down	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
so theyre theyre theyre theyre really trying to start keeping an eye out for those	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4
and it	6 6	6 6
because you will eventually be killed	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 4
you know i think personally im im for it	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6
but when he gets angry it it always over control issues	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 4 4
i do do know what they saw in me	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do think we learned	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
well another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of	6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because1 they have you know just the single bunk beds and stuff	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 2 4 4 4 6 4
the smokers you know how they have the	7 5 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
well of course in the cities	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
we feed them	3 6 3	6 6 6
i figured i could- make this call and get it over with	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but it was okay	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
well good for you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think the	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
do you	6 3	3 6
the kids and the family and everything had to come first	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
react that quickly	6 6 6	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
well because1 these guys if they um	6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time	7 3 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 3 2 7 5 3 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
and it started falling	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6
and everywhere else	2 4 4	6 6 6
so ill ill ill ill watch a soap occasionally	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
uh that that the first ive ive ever heard of it	6 3 1 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3
i see	3 6	6 6
it sure beats dragging hoses around	3 6 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
it was like five or six dollars i ca ca remember exactly	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 4
scream well you did did build one over here	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
it it something	3 1 6	3 1 6
and i thought i	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
actually they do	3 6 6	6 6 6
there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth	6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
what are they doing up there	7 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4
i im im serious	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
here we go you know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
their natural life in jail and not parole after ten or twelve years	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4 4
kids that are not motivated maybe bright	2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but theyve theyve uh theyve theyve gone a few years of neglect	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
well not being a drug user i do do have a problem with that personally	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
what laughter-about a quart	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4
i could go on and on about that	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i would hate to think that anybody thought i	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6
and you give it some sort of a weird	6 3 6 3 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
laughter-it laughter-is	3 6	6 6
texas wildflower beds	2 4 4	6 6 6
my uh my father-in-law participated in a uh	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
and in recognition	7 5 5	6 3 6
cost of houses	2 4 4	6 6 6
it has everybody that you could ever	3 6 3 1 1 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know that that it it it it it amazing	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
at any rate i also saw not long ago once around	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand	3 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
that that a	3 1 6	3 1 6
and the repeat offenders are very few	6 2 4 4 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 4 6
around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for	6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
and he winds up	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
well i i appreciate the feel-	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
well they take	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know if you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
up up around san francisco	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
so that was four and a half hours a week	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
have competition with the japanese and whatnot sometimes	2 7 5 2 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
prevention or or	7 5 5	6 6 6
he he not really he he actually not really a puppy anymore	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6
it it an interesting uh	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 2 4 4
i i think some of the dress codes are different	6 3 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
it it is scary though is is it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard	6 7 5 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
theyre theyre making them1 neon colors	3 1 6 3 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6
i think there there a problem too with teachers trying to um	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
men know how to do that right	2 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
the home improvements	2 4 4	6 6 6
maybe the maybe theyll theyll bring their good schools with them	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board	7 5 3 7 3 7 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
and and it it not at some of the private schools	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
too much	6 6	6 6
oh whoa	6 6	6 6
a lot of companies now are are using uh drug	7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
it it about	6 6 6	3 1 6
foremost uh where we compare	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4
i i do do think we should be spending time	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
we do the same thing	2 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6
my husband	3 1	6 6
i- reinstalled that	6 6 3	6 6 6
few girls that ive ive gone out with	7 5 3 1 1 7 5 5	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6
because all the eligible voters	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
my sister lives in charlotte	2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4
as uh	7 5	6 6
and i think the issue should be settled	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and one was a pant	6 7 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
into the switchboard project and all that	6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 6 6 6
kind of informal	2 4 4	6 6 6
about a year later	2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6
i do do know what wed wed replace it with	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6
indirectly of the crime but	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 2 4 6
i think im im gonna gonna put something like a brown on it	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
it it very much like that except worse	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre a department store	2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
there are several containers	6 6 2 4	6 6 4 6
but it it still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
you know it it probably not radioactive	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
but i can be professional too	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4
you know was protesting this guy guy	6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
or so	6 6	6 6
i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary	6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
mom stayed home	2 4 4	6 6 6
i wanted to quit my job so i could stay home with her the next five months because i know she she going to have to face laughter-that	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess	6 6 3 6 2 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
uh you know the handgun situation um the number of rapes the number of muggings	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
uh just	2 4	6 6
that that strange	3 1 6	3 1 6
so you know you not only	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
does not let us compete fairly in their country	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
my husband has has quit yet	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3	6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 6 6
did you like it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
your uh	6 6	6 6
i think were were going to end up back there in a few years or if if not sooner	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
that that for sure	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and then ultimately they say no	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and that that definitely happens you know	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that right	6 6	6 6
and it you know like on a lake	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
as soon as you you get rid of one goon that that that that that that involved in drugs	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 3 1 6 6 4
seems like there there so many kids that do do have any	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 7	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 1 6 6
and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
it taught me not to be so self-centered and	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
if youre youre talking about a hundred degrees or what thirty zero you know thirty four degrees whatever that is	2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 3 2 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6
based on	6 6	6 6
you never would think that they that they can actually play together	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
id id been doing a lot of things wrong i did did know about	3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 2 4
theyve theyve had it	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
have you been in that	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
seem to outnumber crimes against life	6 6 6 2 4 7	6 6 6 4 4 4
i know	6 6	6 6
itll itll be a dollar movie in no time	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and there was a murder of	6 6 6 7 5 2	6 6 6 2 4 6
theyve theyve got two different aerobics rooms	3 1 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
the theft crimes	2 4 4	6 6 6
it it	3 1	3 1
it just steps on too many people people toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
i i do do have a other than	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
im im just a seafood fan	3 1 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 4
like it was embellished around the	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 3
fun they had with these computer games	7 2 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i i do do know that um	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
that was one of the questions that she asked us to think about	3 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 3 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
that i think there are some occupations that they should such as the health field the transportation field	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
think what what what it gonna gonna be like for my my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 2 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
i do believe it should be befitting the crime	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
stuff like that	2 4 3	6 6 6
even today are graduating from school	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
is is	6 6	6 6
someplace so i figured well thisll thisll be good	2 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
so they just try and make it a personal thing	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
figure out	6 6	6 6
im im from new england	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
but im im not sure what they do in england now	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
he actually knew it	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
educate bennett i think his name was	6 7 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the the novelization of star wars was listed-	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i thought for sure id id been raised properly	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
jumping in	6 6	6 6
so yeah	6 6	6 6
accepted every one that i was offered because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early	6 7 5 3 1 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 2 4 7 5 3 1 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
so you like	6 3 6	6 6 6
but ive ive talked to people in new york	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
trucks and stuff	2 4 6	6 6 6
uh i think it it a real good concept	6 3 6 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
you do do want to over do it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and the quarterbacks just did did do anything	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 3 1 2 4
and easter	2 4	6 6
they really think that the packs	3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4
like i said from what what reported in the news at least it it	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
paul simon	3 1	6 6
sexual offenses	2 4	6 6
for a	6 6	6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
that in my work place who are both of them earning rather	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 7 2 4 4 7	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
and it it just	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh why should we let them set	6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i see	3 6	6 6
what kind of uh what kind of what kind of grass are you growing	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
and it the bird got away from him one afternoon	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so there is a	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
it uh	6 6	6 6
it is it is a lost revenue stream right now	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
uh things that	6 2 3	6 6 6
that kind of person	3 1 2 4	6 6 6 4
i find that	3 6 6	6 6 6
i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
and not really having any	6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
certain sections were being policed and cleaned up	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them1	6 3 6 6 2 6 3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
no burglar alarms no guards	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
like our	6 6	6 6
is there anything else	6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6
now my son does	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
well you know uh talking about the lawyers	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
to washington or to the state and they say theyre theyre going to send some back	6 2 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
have an opportunity to hear just the facts	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 4 2 4
um uh	6 6	6 6
and- stuff like that	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i mean you know you ca ca tell what what a company really has to do with it	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 3
if you had two people that do do have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house	6 3 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
you just start getting	3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
and some we do green	6 7 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and she said well it it not guaranteed	6 2 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
sort of disarm	6 6 6	6 6 6
he he getting cut back	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying	7 5 5 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
uh prison overcrowding	6 2 4	6 6 6
and people are gonna gonna throw a fit	6 2 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
itd itd be kind of exciting in some ways to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i hope it it not my	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
uh reported	6 6	6 6
i do not have any uh cure	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
that that another thing	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
they do not come back very well at all	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they- they might weed you out some other way	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
went off to uh	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
you know and get off the beach	6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think it it mostly cans	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 3 1 6 6
im im afraid to im im afraid to even think about it	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh you have to emphasize-	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and laughter-fried itself on the radiator behind the	6 6 3 6 7 5 6 7	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of social- of um public behavior	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
do things with them you know	6 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
or do you do you get into that that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
we did did we did did even think about it you know	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
and im im like my god you know	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
im im not sure about requiring it you know of people because1	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
and if they ca ca i mean if they have missed that training	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
they they probably know everything from half the time what- how- what time you go to the bathroom	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
she- now ten years old	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6
yeah it was unimpressive to look at	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i been uh ive ive probably had more time than you have to think about this subject	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
and he said you bet	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that i i still feel like there there more to come	2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
so uh	6 6	6 3
that was my graduation present to myself	3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and uh car crime	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6
kind of hard to say now especially after desert storm	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
to pick the right person	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
i mean it burned out	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
um because of all the layoffs and laughter-everything	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
oh do you	6 6 3	6 6 6
it it always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it as if he is the boss and i am the	6 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
and clearly if youre youre into coke and all you wanna wanna do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 6 7 3 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
i had had been down in that part of the state really	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
try it out with their peers	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
and so basically no one was taking the responsibility	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4
our choir is doing this as a money making- raising project	2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
you do do get seem to get that much for the space	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
sale of drugs	7 2 4	6 6 6
and they had to get out of there	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 3
and it cost more	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
they- they give the person the option for a jury	6 3 6 3 1 7 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 2 4 2 4 6 2 4
ive ive um	3 1 6	3 1 6
saberhagen has won	2 6 6	6 6 6
the dress code they have for the kids you know	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
but like beer cans soda cans and what not	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and then if you paid them more youd youd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
and theyve theyve really um	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
well good	6 6	6 6
and now we can no longer spank them	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
oh thatll thatll thatll thatll sound wonderful wo wo it	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6
he just	6 6	6 6
but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
it it going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 6
youll youll	3 1	3 1
for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you do do feel as though you have much of a choice	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
with their pc pc pc or their lap computers or whatever	6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and the aclu aclu aclu aclu aclu gonna gonna get after them1 and have a lawsuit	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 1 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
wants to do it	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
would have been wrong with this dog	6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i never hardly watch the news	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
per particles in the surrounding community because it it not moved away	2 4 4 7 5 5 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 4 4
an ounce	7 5	6 6
maybe not huh	6 6 6	6 6 6
on a volunteer basis	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
received a bill from a a lord and taylor company	6 7 5 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4
it was so good	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
at the time	6 2 4	6 6 6
there there this one	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
well um	6 6	6 6
i had this	3 6 6	3 6 6
and it seemed like the further i got away from dallas	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
you know im im sure that dinner parties will	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
you know he he this jazz performer	6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
she gave him an f on that paper	3 6 3 2 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i probably	3 6	6 6
and of course the competing itself really did did matter what it was	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
im im uh im im mostly a baseball fan	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
so did- were they successful	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4
they never	3 6	6 6
and it allows you to	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
but there there no you know nothing else	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
well the thing is i do do	6 7 5 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
or nine months	2 4 4	6 6 3
income tax and no sales tax	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
this was a gentleman in his sixties	3 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
and he goes running you know	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
so most of the	6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6
i sure-	3 6	6 3
so youve youve got two football teams down there	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
well um	6 6	6 6
and they have a long waiting list too	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 1 6 6 6
how how do you expect the school to	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
my age	2 4	6 6
and one was a skirt	6 7 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
little axle	2 4	6 6
oh it was great	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
the the first well my first car was a fifty mustang	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
at least-	6 6	6 6
so uh	6 6	6 6
you pick a career path	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
and she	6 3	6 3
they do do have like a shower room or anything	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4

well the german shepherd that i had before	6 3 1 1 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
oh right now i think uh were about	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and weve weve got one of those big eight foot privacy fences	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
everytime everytime they have snow on the ground everything everything closed up	7 5 3 7 3 1 1 1 1 1 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 6
from doing it	6 6 3	6 6 3
the oil changes	3 1 1	6 6 6
you know we do do uh	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
i do do have any little tiny kids	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
is that usually what you tell them in the letter	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so many of them now have the ribbons where im im not sure how they do it	2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
it is	6 6	6 6
i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
to root out the	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
me too on gun control	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
and my wife she likes italian and stuff	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4
the three o five was that that v eight	2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
thank you much	6 3 6	6 6 6
it is really a pretty plant	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
laughter-you laughter-know	6 6	6 6
and and uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and and when you stop and look at it i mean the judges theyre- theyre theyre all former lawyers	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
is being supported	7 5 5	6 6 6
uh had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
that was surprising to me	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
uh that that was interesting	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
day after day after day	7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
oh im im sorry no	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
i did did realize it was that expensive	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
um our our breakers are are	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
so that that why im im	6 3 1 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
that that a real easy thing to say that oh sure i would	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4
i think that most people are quite aware theyre theyre not paying that six percent sales tax	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well you can reduce that risk by	6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i used to have	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
jewish neighborhoods and jewish cities	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
nice speaking to you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
they they consider them second class	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 4 4 4 4
but you you got the	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it it really is a buyer buyer market there now	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 3 6 4 6 6 4
you know they they will allow you to	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
but they do	6 6 6	6 6 6
i mean we still have some highways closed	3 6 3 6 6 7 5 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
and so you know they do that	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh the locker rooms with uh	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 6

ugh that that horrible	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
what what gonna gonna happen	7 5 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6
i think it seems that	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i see	3 6	6 6
well if we have one murder a year that that probably	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6
to use it	6 6 3	6 6 6
how will i dust this thing	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6
so it it very	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6

so i have have talked to them this weekend	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and i do do like that at all	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
that they jump on it	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i would	6 6	6 6
i was thinking primarily criminal cases	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 4 4 4
how do you	6 6 3	6 6 6
actually we	6 3	6 6
if you do do want the kids	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i can really relate to	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
stuff and everything to where you can	7 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
if you have one child or fewer	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 4 4 4
the way my mom mom presence countenance it just just for having a puppy	7 5 3 1 1 2 4 7 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
the oldsmobile delta eighty	2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6
uh we ca ca even find a place to shoot	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
it should be over and done with	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in washington	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
well that that kind of the way i was	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 3 2	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
you know theyre theyre	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
and without even bothering	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
i know	3 6	6 6
i have a friend- a friend whose whose real good with uh	3 6 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 4 6 4 4 4
and theyre theyre back in again	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i was- i was petrified	6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
well do do you think that you know just	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
id id hope so	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and they put him through six months	6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 4 4 4
there there there there always a reason why theyre theyre on sale	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6
and the only thing they they	6 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 3
mine did did did not fall into the gifted category	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i did did know that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
and i need it for the break	6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your	6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
i do do know if id id call it science fiction or fantasy	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 2 4	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6
take care of him	7 2 7 3	6 6 6 6
i i i do do	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
oh wow	6 6	6 6
and were were going to get just take it back	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they were pretty much in good taste	3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but im im	6 6 6	6 6 6
know they were like in i think it was on forty hours	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
and i think that that what it is gonna gonna have to come to	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and and	6 6	6 6
brings it home	6 3 6	6 6 6
i hope that what what happening	3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and we have to make sure that uh every	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i was out ruled	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but at least traditionally the laborers	6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
or like when uh gary	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4
everytime everytime they have a	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and id id rather spend the time with my husband than	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i feel that	3 6 6	6 6 6
since now im im in my mid	6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
it all depends again on whose whose writing it and who theyre theyre for because they can slant that too	6 7 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 6 3 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
so yeah	6 6	6 6
well it it pretty hot in the summer	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6
well i ive ive	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
you know diesel fuel is burned in a in	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
we did not get to see the end of the game	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
like for drugs	6 6 6	6 6 6
but he he reading it	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
well if you go to work youre youre just working to pay for day care	6 6 3 6 6 2 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
did something wrong i mean whether it was behavioral or uh you know they were were learning properly or something	2 3 2 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 1 3 1 6 4 6 4
in the system that weve weve got that you know trying to convert over	6 2 4 3 1 1 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
get convicted	6 6	6 6
just some quiet time to wind down from the day	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
she pushes the other one away from the food	3 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
in looking at the	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
like in communities	6 6 7	6 6 6
keeps me going	6 3 6	6 6 6
i do do need to work	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
sure it is	6 3 6	6 6 6
i i mean what weve weve turned the schools into now are just day	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter theyd theyd seen in twenty years	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
um there were probably	6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4
well it it funny because when you know they interview you before you go on the jury	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
if they could	6 3 6	6 6 6
well when all the the mess with uh	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
but see theyre theyre	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but here	6 6	6 6
and you eat these lousy the hot dogs	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
the other thing to do if you really- really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 1 2 3 2 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 6 7 5 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
did they just have like over a weekend	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and it was old rusty	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 6
a number of education reforms	2 4 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
well i was i was uh originally chosen	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
do service the country	6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6
ive ive heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year	3 1 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 7 3 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
uh i felt sorry for them1	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
for ozone and oh yeah all that	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
this this day care is is	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
mean i do do think that law will ever change	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and he got me into it	6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
you can step into mainstream society	3 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 4 4
oh i can see it too	6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 4
so they are all pretty well grown up	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
it it just hard to make yourself go	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6
the sticky buns of course would last you know three or four days	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
well she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because1 she was in intensive care	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
i had ordered a sofa	3 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 4
and then theyd theyd go outside for awhile	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6
um for instance um there there a case a few years back where	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i have a pontiac	3 6 2 4	3 6 2 4
oh i think	6 6 6	6 6 6
she was like oh god he does this all the time you know where are you you know screaming j d	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
and i do do think theyd theyd want to go where they used to work either	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
in different situation you know not a really religious background if if i would get a lot out of it	6 7 5 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
yet you go out on the streets	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
more not than	2 4 4	6 6 6
eight at the time just barely eight	2 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6
through grade school or	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
i can take that for granted	3 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
what what the uh	7 5 6 6	3 1 6 6
i would id id have to go out to the country to jog	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
i think	6 6	6 6
and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you	6 3 1 1 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6
i think it it somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
but crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own	2 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and also uh to get off the clothing	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they do do talk about they they charging that enormous fee every year	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
i i got	6 3 6	6 6 6
that that my kids turning on their music	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4
gets in there maybe it it a blown fuse	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
and she was very affectionate	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
and it will	6 6 6	6 6 6
theyre theyre the pivot point of the universe	3 1 7 5 5 2 4 4	3 1 2 4 6 3 6 4
and they tend	6 3 6	6 6 6
i ca ca	3 6 6	6 6 6
maybe instead of	6 6 6	6 6 6
i would think so	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
the government	2 4	6 6
and there there rats in the attic you know	6 6 6 7 6 7 5 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
where do you work	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
and sure enough i saw that guy	6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
the injector pump went bad	3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
ive ive had teenagers	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
the fact that they that they	2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
got up until about the sixth	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
as a matter of fact that was a very	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and we got some great public works out of it	6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
im im not from here	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
it it it a little bit difficult though	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
and there was no such thing as a job or	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
would be sort of moby fish in a tank	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6
we have a shotgun	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
and what have you uh and be very comfortable	2 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
valet with baseball tickets	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
and invade	6 6	6 6
and really it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i do do i mean i do do know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6
for two years we did did	6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6
so uh yeah	6 6 6	6 6 6
some states they pay uh	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
and when i was just married with no kids	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
there there a metal piece that fits through	6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4	3 1 3 1 6 6 4 4
and we have what we call the five b b uh	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
as long as my kids were little	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
after having killed four people	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
more rebellious	7 5	6 6
but ive ive never actually seen the place itself you know	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on saturday or something like that	7 5 5 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6
so it it is like dance	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 4 4
all right	6 6	6 6
and it would be uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
you just put some cajun well	3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 6
but uh i was	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it was used quite often in the colonial times to	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
and just depending on whether you say yes or no	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
so you think their quality control control going down over there	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 3 4 6 6 6 4
and we had little kids at the time you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
you do do know whether the person sitting next to you	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
you too	3 6	6 6
obviously there there uh	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
i thought boy id id like to teach	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability	7 5 2 4 3 7 5 5 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
at the same time ive ive seen	6 2 4 4 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
always have been	6 6 6	6 6 6
and he he since then has has amended that and	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
and i think maybe	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
and what do those kids do	6 7 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
um and um	6 6 6	6 6 6
one- one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about1 the uh funding of the the school system right now	6 7 5 3 7 5 2 4 7 5 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 3 1 1 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
um yeah	6 6	6 6
for right now	6 6 6	6 6 6
to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone	6 6 2 4 4 7 5 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
and one of the ones that had an impact was	6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
so they did that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
i think he deserves every penny of it	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3
which is good for them	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
well we spent last week end in charlotte with real good friends that had just moved to	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 4 6
well do you think uh	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
we were were getting into capital punishment now	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
uh we do have a very low tax rate	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6
she had high standards	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
it it definitely different	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and i mean	6 3 6	6 6 6
your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve laughter-kids	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
a lot of times it it too	7 5 2 4 6 6 7	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
ive ive had to hang up and stuff	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 4
it just seems like there there just never enough time to pick it up and do it you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
you know	6 6	6 3
you know just	6 6 6	6 6 6
this house was built in seventy	3 1 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 4
or you might	6 3 6	6 6 6
underpaid for	6 6	6 6
ever go up in pennsylvania in the mountains	6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 4
huge stadium in	7 5 5	6 6 6
i try to read	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
kind of depends on when they get in you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
what type of lawn and garden work do you do	7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
i mean here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair you know	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 4
and i brought her to a different vet this time	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6
we uh rented the other one	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3
they put themselves in that situation	3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
not pay attention to what our driver is doing	6 6 7 6 3 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
it it really sad	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
and you could get to it to work on it	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6
but you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
and he knew that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
let let put him into a situation where okay you crossed the line	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
so she usually ends up doing most of it	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
as it stands there there there there many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a civinalcivil uh civil and criminal case	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
it is	3 6	6 6
the it gets cooler when the sun sets	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
or youre youre going to be observed	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 1 6
sometimes i	6 6	6 3
sentencing- juries doing the sentencing in that	6 2 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
right now were were just renting	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
and it cost sixty dollars	6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 4 6
real quick	6 6	6 6
well i was called	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
unfortunately i do do have to work in those companies	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
and and	6 6	6 6
a broader scope for rewarding people for	7 5 5 5 5 2 7	3 6 6 4 4 4 4
people that are uh	2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6
i am a drafter	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
i think	3 6	6 6
you know weve-	6 6 6	6 6 6
theyll theyll make a lot-	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
uh this is my eleventh year	6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 6
and it would would work	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
for for	6 6	6 6
uh use my math um	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 4
there was very little external	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
like when i walk ill ill take along a radio or something	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 3	6 6 2 4 3 4 6 4 6 4 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
i wish they would	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it was a really neat experience	3 6 7 5 5 5	3 6 2 4 4 4
vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
when we built it ten years ago	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
down- uh	2 4	6 6
plus you have to have a place to store all of it	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 3
and they	6 3	6 6
im im really particular about the type of music that i listen to	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre a pain to peel for some people	3 1 7 5 5 5 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
and so	6 6	6 6
promote the collection of taxes in this fashion	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4
let let see uh	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
i just i do do	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6
ive got some interesting information about crawfish	3 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 6 4
use it to do some	6 3 6 6 7	6 6 6 2 4
that they do do have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 2 4 4
i think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
they were bringing up points	7 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4
and ive ive had two cornea transplants	6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
um it it kind of a concern for me	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
when it used to be four or five	6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
men breaking in uh to houses and taking or a man they they think it it the same person	7 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
yeah you were talking about uh	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6
weve weve	2 4	3 1
that their their going to have to do what someone else says even though they did did vote for it	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6
well i am not a home at home a lot	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
well you were were charging gold and silver were you	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
and i was never one uh because my work often took me into court uh never was one that got uh accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 7 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
i believe it	3 6 3	6 6 6
free up	6 6	6 6
uh a volunteer or willingness to join	6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
or or you or they somehow distributing the funds back to you	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6
and uh they had this bill	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
and what to do when theyre theyre faced with it	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i have a couple kids	3 6 2 4 4	3 6 2 4 4
uh it	6 3	6 6
also the politicians put out what makes them1 look good anyway	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and she literally spent	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
some programs the day before	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6
was just as a buffer	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
they had uh a murder mystery	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
particularly if im im gonna gonna be outdoors	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
you are going to be sentenced to death period	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i uh started out when i first got in graduate school i was going into public administration	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
and you	6 3	6 6
how do they handle	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and short of putting nails through it we ca ca get it back on	6 6 6 6 7 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 3 6 4 6 2 4 4
it it just like we need to get rid of these clowns that that serving in the office	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 2 4
i had a uh had a subscription to that last year	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 2 4	3 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
youre youre making a design like a geometric or	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 7	3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i do do know what the percentage	3 6 6 6 3 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and i do do even know what theyre theyre doing for themselves	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 4
which is handy	3 6 6	6 6 6
i remember seeing the video of it on mtv mtv mtv	3 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 4
i know that the	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
all right	6 6	6 6
to be tested	2 4 4	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
ridiculous and terrible just just to uh	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6
and of course	6 6 6	6 6 6
a clue i guess	6 7 3 6	3 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i do do go to east texas	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
which seeming rather ironic	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
maintain trails	6 7	6 6
that that the only way theyre theyre gonna gonna fund it because1	3 1 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 3 1 6 6 6
a lot of it is	3 1 1 1 6	3 6 3 6 6
it does does sound real necessary in texas	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
eagles or the patriots	2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4
and sometimes that that a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff youve youve got to work on too	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
uh just so we do do	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6
well i suppose you may be right on that	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
uh provide some special help in training and particularly uh mentor teachers	6 6 7 5 5 5 2 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
most of these are young people	7 2 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it it it not a deterrent- a deterrent because it it not	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 4 3 4 6 3 1 6
not as much as id id like to	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
at a private well	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh that that a nightmare	6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
it it just hard	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
so i mean his appeal was denied	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
you know as far as	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
so they know that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
did you	6 3	6 6
from the outside	6 2 4	6 6 6
now that that an advantage is is it	6 3 1 7 5 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it	6 6	6 6
you never hear about it really in the big ones	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
went to school	6 6 2	6 3 6
the last selection	2 4 4	3 6 6
whatever it it called they	6 3 1 2 7	6 3 1 6 6
ive ive lost my excuse for that	3 1 6 2 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 4 6 6
certainly that that true in the overall	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
but it just touches so many young people	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
within the suburb here are the	2 7 5 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh no	6 6	6 6
i mean i like	3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6
if it works at colleges itll itll work down below	6 3 6 6 2 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
now it was very nicely done	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
by taking them1	6 6 3	6 6 6
you you miss that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
it was over crowded	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean theyre theyre theyre	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or select- and stuff	6 6 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
all different	6 6	6 6
well i go to saint louis from time to time	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
it it tiny	3 1 6	3 1 6
and so you ca ca	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you know shooting people	6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6
she she mostly golden retriever	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
it it like a little house except the whole face is open	2 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4
boy if someone did break in	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
or a different process thatll thatll hopefully work better	2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
actually this is my first experience with recycling program	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
doing drugs in the home	2 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
then there must be it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 2 4 4
if if the	6 6 2	6 6 6
well that makes a really big difference	6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
what what uh	6 6 6	3 1 6
uh sounds like	3 6 6	6 6 6
but a different authority than mom once in a while you know	2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
so why are are you helping us	6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 1 2 4 6
most of whom are like me that work in in speech labs that are going to use data base eventually	2 4 3 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 3 1 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and it was really	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but not in the guilt or innocence because he has has been	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 6 4 4
it it an organization where we	3 1 7 5 5 3	3 1 2 4 6 4
buick century	2 4	6 6
which is	7 6	6 6

and he wo wo even touch electrical stuff	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
without even thinking or without any concern uh you know	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6
and uh were were were were struggling to find something for those areas	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 7 2 4	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
i read an awful lot of uh	3 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
or something	2 4	6 6
and the guy said let me ask	6 7 5 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer	7 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
but anyway im im glad to hear that you agree with me on the	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6
and my sister had gotten through college	6 3 1 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 6 6 4
i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 3

i think it it good for kids to grow up around pets as as long as they do do have any allergies to them1 or anything	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
he is he he a big old thing	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
so we go out there	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
well you know youre youre married	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 3 1 6
and so i	6 6 3	6 6 6
that that true i think	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
well i think that in the in the cases that like that uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
but it it fairly simple	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
by the time we had a babysitter for that laughter-long	6 2 4 3 2 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and it was amazing	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
they do	2 6	6 6
he actually	3 6	6 6
it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
going an hour later and picking it up	6 7 5 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
well it does it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 6
theyre theyre theyre	6 3 1	6 6 6
i grew up about the same time you did	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i ca ca remember	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because1 theyre theyre in almost every shopping center	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4
and i know even like in the high schools in dallas	6 3 6 2 7 5 5 5 5 5 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
and talk to them about it	6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6
uh i- i really feel as though the interdiction effort is is	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
you can any drugs you want	3 6 2 4 3 2	3 6 6 6 6 4
is a bit of a problem	6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4
and maybe part of that is educating	6 6 7 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
he jumped in again	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
well theyre theyre all saying that theyre theyre going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway	6 2 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 6 4 4 4
direct conversion	2 4	6 6
is much better	6 6 6	6 6 6
the- the investigator	3 1 1	6 6 6
i did did care too much for the last one either	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
well rowlett had sent sent out a survey not too long ago	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
oh it	6 6	6 3
well that remark in itself is a slam	6 3 1 1 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well that that okay	6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6
well i i think im im getting too old for all that	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it it it a lot of that	6 6 3 1 7 5 2 3	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4
like uh	6 6	6 6
im im im im im im	6 6 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
it does does look as though	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
all you have to do is touch a button	7 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but um instead of just like	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
those i can understand	2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 2 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 4
uh uh with the with the great expenditure- expenditure of effort and time there	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
one cow	3 1	6 6
i mean everybody does	6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
uh the the thing you know	6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3
all righty	6 6	6 6
well there is always the uh the possibility even remote as it is of uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
talk about	6 6	6 6
well i just- you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 6 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
i thought it was	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
he said no theyre theyre not	3 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 3 1 6
it it um	3 1 6	3 1 6
rather than	2 4	6 6
but theyve theyve been in office since the the nineteen forties	6 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
because a lot of companies are um you know	2 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
every one of the young execs coming up	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
oh im im sure he does	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into	6 7 5 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
the other one you need to go see is	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
such parties trying to do it without your knowledge	2 4 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
my first impression was um	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 4 6
but there have been	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
rights if not everyone is tested	2 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
and they paid like	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
you know i mean i i guess as we get older	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but in the summer	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
you know it it it gets to be a a a big problem	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4
the luck of keeping them alive through those first	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
and i got a call yesterday	6 3 6 2 4 3	6 3 6 2 4 4
we all need that time	3 7 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6
and why did did it work last time	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
and i visited the prison up here	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 4
there there always uh there there there there always a jury that might be laughter-swayed	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
do you have kids	6 3 6 7	6 3 6 6
the equality	7 5	6 6
or you know even if it it smoking inhibits you know your ability to function	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
what- what- from- from what i understand from various- various- various net readings it- it-	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6
theyve theyve actually waited for them1 where theyve theyve robbed you know particular neighborhood	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give give him for it for a trade-in	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 3 2 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
it it hard to drag her laughter-away	6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and were were starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
well my parents wanted to send me to college	6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and the guy said	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
i guess i was of age when the peace corps came laughter-in and all that	3 6 3 6 6 7 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
gosh it it hard to think of an exact example	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
probably seven	2 4	6 6
and the people that	6 2 4 3	6 3 6 6
i work here in germantown	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
legal system	3 1	6 6
the centigrade	2 4	6 6
diesel pickup	2 4	6 6
uh one of the questions was	6 7 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 4 6
kids are	3 6	6 6
you know it might only be	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
if there were more than one child i do do know there there would be no way to do it	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i really do do know you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
he finished it off	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
that that true	6 6 6	3 1 6
and what that vote meant	7 3 2 4 7	6 6 6 4 4
towns like clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate	2 4 4 7 2 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
so ive ive always been involved	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
it can raise the car car center up a little bit	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
or do i look for a used car that that maybe two three years old that that	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 6 6
i do too	3 6 6	6 6 6
it was i	6 6 6	3 6 6
and uh i think were were seeing a lot of	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 4
where uh it would appear the crimes were very similar	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 2 4 2 4 4
that that	3 1	3 1
and they were talking about	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
he he going to do what he wants to do	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3
and it should should be that way i do do think	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 6
they are famous for i guess having really top	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
that in fact	7 5 6	6 6 6
uh made me feel kind of strongly against it is that uh	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
and it was just a small thing then	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6
i do do know if dallas is in the top three	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and you can	6 3 6	6 6 6
and then sam sam called him	6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
it it	3 1	3 1
but uh	6 6	6 6
and everybody else is infantry	6 3 2 6 2	6 6 6 6 4
and mechanical engineering interested me	6 2 4 6 3	6 6 4 6 6
anyway someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year	6 7 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 6
in taxes	6 3	6 6
this is the first time there have been problems	3 6 7 5 5 6 7 5 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i i guess one knows one one own storlystory	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
well youre youre not a thirteen year old	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3
but you can buy	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and cases like that he argues need to be constrained	6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
in the society	6 2 6	6 3 6
and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the	6 2 4 3 2 4 3 7 2 4 7 2	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and it was just	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
but most of the time- the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there you know therell therell be a small article in the paper about it	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
certainly a language i know does does but just has a word for loneliness	6 2 4 3 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that you do and	2 3 2 4	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre the exact same thing	3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 2 6 6 6
you know it	6 6 6	6 6 6
the characters played very well	2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
well it it not industrial engineering	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
everybody- you know always see guns in there	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6
uh and i think that would provide	6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
outside outside awful deceiving sometimes	2 4 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
there there too many kids and	6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6
they in fact they just it was just a big thing recently	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and it just kept coming on up through the generations	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs is	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 4 6
in a small town in wisconsin	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
an um	6 6	6 6
you know i think to myself what did i do	6 6 3 6 6 3 7 6 3 6	3 6 2 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
and so theyre theyre more less apt to vote in	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
you know in a car accident	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
a capital crime and- and you do do believe in	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i know i know nobody around here does it	6 6 3 6 3 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
on channel thirteen uh they had some	6 7 5 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
one of them is whose stars and stripes now	7 2 3 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i could could have asked for anything	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and uh and uh yeah- no matter what a uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4
and then maybe give you another chance to go through it	6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 3
im im the only one that pays attention to him	3 1 2 4 4 3 2 7 2 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i would really	3 6 6	6 6 6
it it not	6 6 6	3 1 6
lots of laughter-times	7 2 4	6 6 6
so i go outside the area for that	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
the rain let off just a little bit it	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
but uh i like to have them1	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
um i really i do do work outside of school	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
it was really old	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i mean i have have had one yet	3 6 3 6 6 6 7 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that it	3 1 6	3 1 6
i am in a man man job	3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
see he goes to a lot of games	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 2 4
and he describes it as	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
ive ive ive ive seen those	6 6 3 1 6 7	3 1 3 1 6 6
and i was really disappointed with that	6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
not really	6 6	6 6
thirty thousand people	2 4 4	6 6 6
maybe this	6 3	6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
sentence them to a hundred	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
when they do that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
you know in in my job	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
well it it it an interesting concept though when you look at uh of of how baseball how	6 6 3 1 7 5 5 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
and i i do do think ill ill do it again	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
just you know just teach the basics in schools	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
he he	3 1	3 1
oh my son bought this snake uh	6 3 1 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you could get a summary	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
and they really enforce it	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3
well that that the thing see you know	6 3 1 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
the police department	2 4 4	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
you purchase as long as you do do go crazy trying to get cash back	3 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
i mean it alleviates your problem	6 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 2 4 6 4
dinner party	6 6	6 6
it conditions people to it	3 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
and nope	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
they had one school	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
and then you had fifteen days while they checked	6 6 3 6 7 5 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
the um	6 6	6 6
that that exactly right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
how uh	6 6	6 6
the casing it comes in	2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
i do do know um	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone someone life and like you say it it it it there there no doubt whatsoever	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 3 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 4 4
and uh he was showing it to me	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3
and um the mets mets	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 4
uh i id id	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but im im not a power user	6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
i think there there a lot of waste	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
care to support them	6 6 6 3	6 3 4 6
you go	3 6	6 6
theyre theyre still pretty much in demand	3 1 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
i can see if	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
i i do do	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
when theyre theyre so cheap too at the video stores that you can	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
um im im i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 3 2 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 4 4 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
so i do do like that aspect	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
sounds like a lot of money though	6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
or if it it uh violence oriented	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4
get from the kids at	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
what kind of recycling programs do you have in rowlett	7 5 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
i do do know if you have a place there called uh	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
that i think that uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
with our	6 7	6 6
but on the you ca ca hold them1 back	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
shed shed just get on the first step and lay down	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
and the schools down here rate you know	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
the more people are aware of it the the more theyll theyll do	6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6
in the political- in the presidential race	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
i ca ca	3 6 6	3 6 6
the cat got sick	3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6
and it was incredibly complicated and difficult	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
which is uh i guess about five years old	3 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
im im trying to	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
after a while ill ill start watching it	6 7 5 3 1 6 6 2	6 3 6 3 1 6 4 6
oh that- that that when they made cars though	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3
competed because really she had no choice	6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
i do do think anybody roots differently	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
thousands and thousands of samples that uh going through it in a day	7 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
so easy to pick up and go	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4 4
and im im for college	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
it it real small town	3 1 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
with any kind of	2 7 5 5	6 6 6 6
i guess our next	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i- i see that too in the air force	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and it takes some drastic steps at this point	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
and you know like	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6
as to the death penalty or whatever	7 5 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 2 4 4 6 4
well it it helpful	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
and i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine	6 3 6 6 2 6 7 5 2 7 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
it it the way youre youre raised	6 6 7 5 3 1 7	3 1 6 3 6 6 6
are do- you do you play the piano	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4
sevren is	3 6	6 6
and i do do see why it could could be shortened considerably	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 4 6 4 4
then it it good for them to go to different	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
and that was one of the questions	6 3 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
random drug testing	7 5 5	6 6 6
one way that we do it	2 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
the thing i do do like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek	7 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 7 6 6 7 5 6 6 6	3 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4
i just see that as maybe a good idea	3 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
but it was the last	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
it it i just have a small plot	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
but if youre youre in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 4 6 6 4 4 4
this last year	2 4 4	6 6 6
and it it takes us maybe uh well-	6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh actually im im a red sox fan more than anything	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and no one knows about it and you know it sinked in through the ground and all that	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
you the	3 6	6 3
that that a real good idea	3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 6 4
i mean you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
or we did did have time to do those bins or something	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
and uh	7 5	6 6
on such a problem	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i was central california	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i want you to have control of your own business	3 6 3 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
plus the the the	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
areas in which ti ti stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that	7 5 3 1 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
well you know there there a lot of companies that wo wo give maternity- women maternity leave	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4
listen to cnn cnn cnn or headline news about an hour a day	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 4
we have cathedral ceilings in uh two rooms	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
im im a im im a technician	6 6 6 3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
you know there there	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
she enjoys her though	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and ours were in mils	6 3 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 4
well i think that	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
he he not really into all that	3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees	7 5 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 4 6 6 4
while they were there	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it	6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3
well i guess although	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
im im going to have to keep that in mind for my	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
things where if youre youre a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on	2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 6
theyve theyve decide the penalty separately from the verdict	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
stay in their current job	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i think it it like a lot of things in the in the	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6
you know how realtors are	3 6 6 7 6	6 3 6 6 6
money spent there	3 2 4	6 6 6
you ca ca do that	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
you know if theyre theyre overcrowded just keep cramming them1 in there till they just suffocate	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
i always vote	3 6 6	6 6 6
irritates the heck out of me	6 7 5 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
but my other line is blinking	6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i know that was a big thing	3 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
there there a lot of you know	6 6 7 5 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 4
it really is	3 6 6	6 6 6
it it more of	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
oh a hundred and forty mile trip	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
sold as purple buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
we went in together and hired a private instructor	2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
i never knew very much at all	3 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6
you know i- i really do not know	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
uh which was a big disappointment	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
you know that that that what all these these hearings are about	6 6 6 3 1 1 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
or whether	6 6	6 6
and my house just burned down you know	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6
so youre youre working on your doctorate	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
it it	6 6	3 1
really have have had a whole lot of time to get out to	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
he he not ready to retire	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
i mean think the the shame that must have been on president bush to	6 6 6 6 6 7 3 7 5 5 5 3 1 7	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
did it with everybody	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
um no	6 6	6 6
ive ive ive heard	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
to separate it	6 6 3	3 6 6
responsibility just personally	2 6 6	6 6 6
buy the motherboards motherboards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax	6 3 1 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 4 4 4
well it	6 6	6 6
i do do i do do know what his name is	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 6	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i want to say central canada	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 4 4
and of course it does does fit right now	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and there still was was enough minority vote to get	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 6 6
green spiky leaves	2 4 4	6 6 6
better than having	6 6 6	6 6 6
winnow the facts from the	2 4 4 4 4	6 3 4 4 6
jobs in life	2 6 2	6 6 6
well we um belong to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints which is like the	6 7 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6
it is not random in the sense that they have	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
i do do think much of life- of life imprisonment	3 6 6 6 7 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but nowadays there there so much on tv where	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
yeah that uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
if you call the eight eight eight hundred number	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
it it just	6 6 6	3 1 6
no life threatening uh capabilities uh	2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and and then youre youre kind of	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
but still	6 6	6 6
i mean very very little about it	6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
i try to dress- dress	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
almost everyone out on the street	3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
but okay	6 6	6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
you know it	6 6 6	6 6 6
so im im lost on that one	6 3 1 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was uh edward scissorhands	2 4 3 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 3 1 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 2 4 4
oh im im im im a dog person	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
so do you your privacy being invaded at any time	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
or some of the chevy two eighty	2 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 3
and that that not necessarily fair	6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
well do you think that that in a civil case	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4
that that that that practically has to be blasted in i guess	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that that guaranteed	2 4 6 2 4 4 3 2 3 1 1 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and that was just mind boggling	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
i mean she will	6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
a whole generation of my feeling uh before that that going to be accomplished	2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
in the future	6 2 4	6 6 6
and he always-	6 3 6	6 6 6
laughter-whether laughter-youre laughter-youre laughter-a laughter-veteran or whether you	6 3 1 7 5 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
if there was majority rule that it would be easy	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
quilted uh uh hanging	2 4 4 4	6 6 4 6
biggest thing for me is	7 5 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
it might be thursday for the high schools	6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4	3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
i do do i do do know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
i guess were were not supposed to	3 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 6
and they had	6 3 6	6 6 6
my daughter daughter	2 4 4	6 6 6

it it a program to teach them to be more self-reliant	3 1 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	3 1 2 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
this summer	2 4	6 6

and i think that really makes a difference	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
and i guess guys can take advantage of that	6 3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6

make it more	6 6 6	6 6 6
he he gonna gonna be going to kindergarten	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused	3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
crimes where i can see it making the most sense	2 4 3 2 4 3 2 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 2 4 4
but i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
as a general rule the people that married	6 7 5 5 2 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
that that what brought me here	3 1 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
then i went to colorado springs the next week to do some training at the ti ti up there	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 4 4 6 4

you know and these guys they come to work every morning	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 2 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
because1 i have killed a lot of things here	6 3 6 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
uh out of their uh budget	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4
another friend going into law	3 1 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6
repentance or anything else you know then	7 5 3 2 6 6 6	6 3 4 6 6 6 6
i see what youre youre saying	3 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
so far as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 2 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
me too	3 6	6 6
but no	6 6	6 6
the- the-	6 6	6 3
in the in the very end	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 2 4 6
i had to make vegetarian meals without using soybeans soybeans	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and it it it	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i think that that always been true	3 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
competency of	7 2	6 6
i grow	3 6	6 6
and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the uh	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6
but they were born around christmas because one of them is named tinsel	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 7 2 3 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i sure do do	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
do they uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and i i see it being most beneficial if it it in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
but for some reason a mini skirt is	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6
uh the logistics of the thing that uh	6 7 5 5 2 4 3 7	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6
childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 2 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 4
and he you know	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
then by march things are getting warm again	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
if you had if you were a teacher	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 4
well have a good night-	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3
you know you go through the program	6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 2 4
it it in here somewhere	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
so it was	6 6 6	6 6 6
the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge	7 5 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 4
im im ready to go	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i think that that pretty standard	3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
maybe not solve it	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
is this pat im im talking to now	6 6 7 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
of one run games	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
attitude is is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do and	2 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
just a	6 6	6 6
fairly extensive	6 6	6 6
then youve youve got to have this to be able to perform well on the job youve youve got to have the flexibility that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 2 4 6
we do do i mean we do a lot of little trips around here um	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4
oh i do do even remember	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
laughter-you laughter-know	6 6	6 6

but ive ive been following spring training	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
the irrigation-	2 4	6 6
perhaps maybe one	6 7 5	6 6 6
you know you hear so many stories listening to them like	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
i do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and it looks like hopefully shell shell do a nice job	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
we ca ca get involved in their civil war	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and it it like	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you have to save laughter-all of your uh vacation time	3 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i can go ahead and start	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4
as far as uh you know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and they they	6 3 1	6 6 6
i liked rainman	3 6 2	6 6 6
well i do do really like that very much	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and it was it it was brand new when i checked it out	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
stonehenge of course you know	2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
twenty hours a day	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6
how how can it work	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 4
it it was just over a year	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
they devoured it that quickly	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
it it true	3 1 6	3 1 6
police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution	7 5 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
if theyre theyre stupid enough to come through then	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
so i- i get a check back	6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know somebody	6 6 3	6 6 6
it seems like it would be	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably-	6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
a real dog and cat	3 1 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 6
um anyway	6 6	6 6
in like in the future	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that americans	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
we have a very good public school up here	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
really quite good	6 6 6	6 6 6
she had to go with me	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6
is working properly	6 6 6	6 6 6
but it it going to get even worse later	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6
i woke up	3 6 6	6 6 6
you wanna wanna go first	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
for for other people too that	6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 4 6 6
there there some noise on this end	6 6 7 5 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
oh definitely	6 6	6 6
i think there should be individuality in dressing	3 6 6 6 6 7 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
go ahead	6 6	6 6
poodle not too long ago	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4
no professionals	2 4	6 6

vote against the incumbent every time	6 6 2 4 7 5	6 6 2 4 6 4
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
and there are a few in some of the more	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but uh it it just really an incredible thing	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
now theyre theyre starting to recycle that stuff	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
the the saltwater fish have so much more	6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
it was it was just seventy miles	6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 4 4 4 6
uh he goes and gets it	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 6 6

that woman	7 5	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
have have tried to upgrade myself right now	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 4
uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
it was was a real problem	6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 3 1 6
seems like i do a lot in the midwest lately	6 6 3 6 7 5 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
is the fact that	6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6
i- i would have really i have have really priced you know in the market	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4

oh okay	6 6	6 6
we you know we i like it there	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
apparently the air pollution and the fact that it it delivered right up in high altitudes	6 3 1 1 2 7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 1 6 4 4 6 4 4
and theyll theyll take them1 places	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
so theyre theyre pretty	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
but my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they decided	6 6	6 6
and they start out	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in denver with me for thanksgiving	6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 2 4 3 6 6 2 6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
i do do think wed wed need a whole church	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
but uh you know with the technology we have today	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4

it it it it easy to get caught up	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
i think if you you just have to stick with it	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
and then the	6 6 6	6 6 6
they do do teach them1 good values like drugs are bad	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
and since they do do have the yearly fee	6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
we stripped ours we stripped ours off	6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4

and but then they lost too much business	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and uh it it interesting because the county i live in	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6

the college i was going to in kentucky	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
and he he six foot	6 3 1 7 5	6 3 1 6 6
protects us in the long run hopefully	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
brackets uh their habits their hobbies their income	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
that eat	3 2	6 6
any team- any team that that- where the owner would fire tom landry you know is like	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
im im in my paperwork here	3 1 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 4 6
but i do do feel invaded by it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3
close to where my mother is	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
youre youre lucky	3 1 6	3 1 6
and he said i ca ca believe that youre youre still getting such a kick out of that movie	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 4
they were using them as	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
not necessary or legal then i just refuse	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 4 6 6 6 4
there really is	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh god-	6 6	6 6
so theyre theyre going to have to	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
well you should uh run for a school board position	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
uh they these guys uh have taken the place of theodore white on reporting elections	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 7 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 2 4 4
they sound familiar	3 6 6	6 6 6
social changes a lot	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not	3 6 7 5 6 7 5 5 5 6 2 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4
well i- i moved to dallas about five years ago	6 6 3 6 6 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
seems that those things happened before	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
i had a uh i had a business going	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
scouts and	7 2	6 6
that are really	2 4 4	6 6 6
like murderers	6 2	6 6
even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes i like to have something- a little- just a little something that that feminine	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 3 4 4
women working	2 6	6 6
that that what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway	3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and um	6 3	6 6
uh i just feel that uh you know each person has to dress	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
and you are not that much further north	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and she she training her	6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
but so many of the people that commit crimes do do get punished	6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6
one of the reasons i guess is because there there so much more income in the family with both parents working	7 5 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
well anyways	6 6	6 6
theyre theyre just very tough on criminals	2 4 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
that does does cost you as much	3 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
so it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
it was no more new	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
maybe somebodyll somebodyll vote for them1 that would would have if they had come down on the wrong side	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
the bottles at individual homes	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4
so mine are you know i use mine for recreation	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
but uh his attorneys gotten him off	6 6 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 4
it- i think it will	6 3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6
and they were just really	6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
i do do really love exercise	3 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6
well you know that that interesting though	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
keep wanting to get further	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
not necessarily right there with you	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
means of education out there rather than college	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 4
and im im know	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
although um	6 6	6 6
i think uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
no no remorse what	6 7 5 6	6 6 6 3
oh my gosh	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
we get the newspaper and uh	3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6
if there was some way for for women to to stay home even if they could work you know	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
need to go face this group of twenty	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 4 6 6 6 4
there there a very large uh or very high percentage of car theft	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 2 4 4
but they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 2 4 6 3 1 6
im im trying to think of	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 3 1 6
now okay we ran into some problems once	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh everything we did	2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
it it a it it an air conditioner sensing device	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
how do you know that	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i have a pistol	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
are the new york uh are the new york	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
and maybe that that a change well well see	6 6 3 1 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
it it the basic unit	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 4
but i have a sister that that a uh school teacher	6 3 6 7 5 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
ive ive just started drinking a new	3 1 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera	7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4
i think	3 6	6 6
messed with anything uh	6 6 3 7	6 3 4 6
you know he he never going to be	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
liter of oil and	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
so and i would be glad to see that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4
maybe it was the other new york team which is the yankees	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
now i do have a	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
who um	3 2	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
do i really-	6 3 6	6 6 6
there there a lot of people that are are for war	6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4 4 3	3 1 6 1 2 6 6 3 1 6 6
you ca ca really expect that parent who who	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
the owner of the store popped her	3 1 1 1 1 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i mean im	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it just a sad situation	3 1 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 4
looking looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it	6 6 6 3 2 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 4 6
demand but	7 5	6 6
and of course	6 6 6	6 6 6
now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips	6 6 2 4 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
i think all women are going to work	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
laughter-good laughter-grief	6 6	6 6
um youve youve got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure	2 3 1 2 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
and their belief system and all- all their structured	6 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i have have uh i have have had something like that happen	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
theyre theyre down to as little small as six people in	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
they do	3 6	6 6
of course	6 6	6 6
for people to to commit the crime- uh to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away	7 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable	3 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
he was out at tech	3 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6
and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh excalibur	6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 7 5 2 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
and i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and said were were going to turn this over to our attorneys if you do do pay	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 3 1 6
i i ca ca give you figures	6 3 6 6 6 3 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
cruelty joke	7 5	6 6
total salary	2 4	6 6
well i	6 6	6 6
an uh an escape type of thing	7 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
i would not want to	3 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre theyre theyre real big into it	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3
they must charge fees	3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
problem because were were so wound up in the	7 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and uh and the point of of i guess	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
i mean it does does have to be it could be like a	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
kind of like the referee	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 1 6 6
the person that that wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun gun gun a knife a	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 7 5 2	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6
i do like that	3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
he he he did pretty good on that one	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed	6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 4
i do do think that that that that i think that that more of a personal view of mine	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 7 5 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and they cut the show off and showing- started showing us another football game	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
start uh	6 6	6 6
this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
she received a bill from them uh that she had visited	3 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4
it it uh othello	6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6
because you got to	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
their list	2 4	6 6
this young	6 6	6 6
he was too	3 6 6	6 6 6
and yet others i know are just wonderful	6 6 2 3 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and it it not accessible to the cafeteria now	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
or or do you think that	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6
i mean just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
im im not going to do this anymore	3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
and just	6 2	6 6
because there there no uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
are you talking about a real river creek	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
i dont-	6 6	6 6
plus i was going through	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
and if they were were spending all the money on drug testing	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
and that that just about as bad as a kid	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for laughter-christmas	3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
theyre theyre really terrible	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
they uh been in jail before	3 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 4
so we kept going out until	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
i- i ca ca get out to dance all the time	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
worry about it	2 4 3	6 6 3
see i ca ca even think of who the new orleans quarterback is	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6
i would would have thought that pillsbury could would the i mean or even had chemicals- you know well	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
and that that very acceptable at ti ti	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
interesting perspective	2 4	6 6
um well im im not getting any-	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
with with both of those things	6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and i mean they just grow so beautifully	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
he seems so macho i just	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
to uh do it	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree	6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
no argument here	7 5 6	6 6 6
theyre theyre so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers do do know	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 4 3 1 6
what can we do about it	7 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
exotic pet shop	2 4 4	6 6 6
on uh	6 7	6 6
well the husbands husbands roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms	6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 7	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 6 6
we both think of that that as just so important to get him involved in stuff like that	3 7 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
well see i do do know anything about politics	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i saw that one	3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
and me it not bad at all	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i said i ca ca imagine	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and the one time that we went we got one it was overlooking the water	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 7 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
number one because generally if if they are involved in that type of thing they theyre into theft	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 7	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
you just sort of	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
um and i and i recall when president bush said that you know	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
they may spend years	3 6 6 2	3 6 6 6
and one story	6 2 4	6 6 6
they had no choice	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
so i i	6 6 3	6 6 3
day like	6 6	6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
found guilty	6 6	6 6
actually i work for the fbi fbi fbi	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6
but if it was a formal	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and theyd theyd just play	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
and theyre theyre	6 3 1	6 6 6
it it it it where	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6
i think that uh that they should	3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean	6 6	6 3
and uh the legislature just passed what they called a robin hood bill	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 2 4 4 4
i like moody blues	3 6 3 1	3 6 6 6
i also	3 6	6 6

that the justice himself	2 4 4 3	6 3 4 4
it it a long term type of process where in a small organization it it uh	3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4

it it too bad that theyve theyve gotten so expensive	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 2 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
but you pick up the gun and point it at the person	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4

that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
regularly- uh just across the board	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
an individual just because it it just because the state ca ca really find out about it	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 6 6 6 3

some history books are pretty scary	2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
i know	6 6	6 6
i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
im im even trying	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6

on my daughter	6 3 1	6 6 6
uh kind of what im im	6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
and if you do do you will perish	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4

well- and uh you know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i- i- i do do know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 1 6
but then you have to look at reality	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well im im not	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
it it it it uh	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 1 6

i uh	6 6	6 6
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
it was told to me or suggested to me	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
and uh not necessarily you know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i believe it is	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
it it uh	6 6 6	3 1 6
well uh ive	6 6 6	6 6 6
and then youll youll have a realistic assessment of what youre youre getting	6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 1 7	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 1 6
because i- i really liked my eighty	6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6

and im im im im going off	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6

i- i see it all too often	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
but it turned out so much better like that because	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4

segment of society	2 3 1	6 6 6
well same here	6 2 6	6 6 6
it it	6 6	6 6
out of enclosing the garage	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4
and all of a sudden we know weve weve gotten changes made	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 7 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
