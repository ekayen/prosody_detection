i had had thought of that	3 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 3
and they uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
or fifty seven a hundred	2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
fun trying to UNK her	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 6
what do you think	7 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and they kind of give it a very upscale and very UNK UNK	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4

how can you expect to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
you know they even get a	6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
and you know if youre youre going to be jogging on the side of the road that that that that even more miserable	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
oh oh	6 6	6 6

i think this is because the kids are getting to me	3 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 4 6 3
uh everybody has to put in so many hours of	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4
uh just something to i-	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but i guess sometimes it kind of UNK you to really get going	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
you want to go ahead and start	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 2 6
what laughter-about a quart	6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess	6 6 3 6 2 3 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
it it going to be a problem getting back there because it was UNK right up against the fire wall	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6
it it like doctors in lawsuits	6 6 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 4
each individual UNK	2 4 4	6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
my mother mother uh	3 1 1 6	6 3 6 6

has nothing to do with justice whatsoever	6 3 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i do do i do do think that that that my responsibility as a	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and they pick that up on monday	6 3 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i did did pay for	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i mean that	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh let let see	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
oh those are nice	6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4
one of the things that it it used for primarily	7 2 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 4 4
and i i think that in the future youre youre i think youre youre going to see a lot more	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
and theyre theyre still let out on the street after one or two years	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying	7 5 5 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i like the older stuff too	3 6 2 4 4 6	3 6 2 4 6 6
things like this	2 4 6	6 6 6
and i visited the prison up here	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
it it just a lot of fun	6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
it puts you a hole in your money bag	3 6 6 7 5 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
like uh truck drivers and things like that	2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean they	3 6 6	6 6 6
they started marketing it in	3 6 6 2 6	2 4 4 6 6
out here on the UNK	2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4
and if theyre theyre able-bodied people	6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh she had puppies the same week my daughter was born	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
there there saying oh well you know the the people ca ca afford it	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 1 6 6
the teams that were there last year were	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 2 6 4 6 4
we got the thing down here called a UNK	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4
i sort of see	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve UNK	3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money	3 2 4 4 4 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1 6
and i i think youre youre right	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 1 6
he he going to do what he wants to do	3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
there there a lot of that going on in dallas too	6 6 7 5 2 3 2 4 4 3 6	3 1 7 5 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
so what made you decide to put her in a montessori school	6 7 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
we set a table up	3 6 7 5 6	3 6 3 6 6
recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	2 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
theyll theyll send them back	3 1 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
i mean you you pulled UNK like that and	6 6 6 3 6 7 2 3 6	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
and we bought one	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
seven or something like that	2 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6
trying to make	6 6 6	6 6 6
who who from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that UNK	3 1 2 7 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
one of the reasons is	7 2 4 4 6	6 3 1 6 3
then i went to the texas	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
so i finally just went to see it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you got to take some time UNK	3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
with women working so much theyre theyre kind of pulled out of it too	6 2 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean it it one thing that i and the colleges knows that	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 2 3 1 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
that you owe sales tax for something uh can be UNK	7 3 7 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
you know gotten all messed up	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
so it it effected all of us	6 3 1 6 7 2 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
before long	6 6	6 6
and he kind of looked down and saw that car	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
they say the roots have developed	3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
i i do do even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
a hundred kilometers	2 4 4	3 6 6
of course just UNK what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
and it only had had very very low mileage on it	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
if you pay	6 3 6	6 2 4
well you can look in the uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
you got the problem with all your cars are still	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
big places	2 4	6 4
well in the neighborhood	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
a lot of the crime is very UNK	7 5 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
or your child UNK	6 2 4 6	3 6 6 6
that that great	3 1 6	3 1 6
i agree totally	3 6 6	6 4 4
and um	6 6	6 6
with uh a certain	2 4 7 5	6 6 2 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and then they	6 6 6	6 6 6
well actually you have to give put them1 in there unsmashed	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 4
we got married right out of high school	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i could could believe that she could could think of any place	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
but to me texas see and kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
that the rehabilitation	7 5 5	6 2 4
youre youre taking care of it yourself	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 3 1 4
back in vietnam	6 6 3	6 2 4
so it	6 6	6 6
i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the district of UNK at washington	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
they go okay then start one	2 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 3
it it cheap entertainment	6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6
well do do you think that you know just	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it gets to a point	6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 2 4
UNK the normal uh procedures	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
after having killed four people	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 4 4 4
it looks like it would be uh	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
read in the paper just last week ibm ibm ibm ibm UNK their new laptop computer	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
where do you live	6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
it it not a big deal for them to go	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i thought okay	6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6
little UNK	7 5	6 6
do you smoke	6 3 6	6 6 6
and i mean it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
UNK or from the bottom maybe and go clear up	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
but she had she had UNK called and left a message on our recorder	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
i do do think i could stay home all the time and do nothing	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 4 4
that they	3 1	6 6
actually no	6 6	6 6
we it it a house we bought uh about	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
i- i guess	6 3 6	6 6 4
and they said well you know he theyre theyre he has no job	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 1 6 6 6 4
as they killed in washington dc dc	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 2 4 4 6 6 6
that that funny	3 1 6	3 1 6
in in psychology does does address it	6 6 2 6 6 6 3	6 6 4 6 1 6 6
i mean weve weve got coaches that teach	6 6 3 1 6 2 3 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
give in to their uh human rights desires	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
which i think is	3 1 2 4	6 3 6 3
i guess ive ive UNK baskets and stuff before in the past	3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
i did did play	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
it still	3 6	6 6
i i do do	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
uh and not wait until theyre theyre in high school	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4
uh in the church	6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
is kind of nice	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
for you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
keep wanting to get further	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
um although you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth	3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
it it um it it in the other room	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um	6 2 4 4 3 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
and not really having any	6 6 6 6 7	6 6 4 6 6
i see him out there	3 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
previous secretary of uh	6 6 6 6	2 4 6 6
you definitely do do have laughter-time	3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
and ill ill get get stuff out of that	6 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 1
theyre theyre not bonding anymore	2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them1	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
all sorts of things	3 1 1 1	6 6 6 6
what ive ive taken to doing lately	3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 2 4 4
and i do do think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 3 7 6 6 6	6 3 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
a lot more single UNK	2 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 4 4
as we were coming up	6 7 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6
UNK UNK a real- a big hole does exist right now uh in that UNK can just say oh i- i forgot that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
it might be	3 6 6	6 6 6
well it it funny because when you know they interview you before you go on the jury	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4
were were were were were were behind down here	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
subaru had a good reputation uh for you know	2 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 7	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6
im im married and have uh a couple of children	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
in the paper one you have to separate	6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
this is gross	3 6 6	6 6 6
that that my understanding of the way um the way it works	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
is it doing a good job or a bad job	6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
messed with anything uh	6 6 3 7	6 2 4 6
and also uh to get off the clothing	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
leave the furniture just one certain way you ca ca UNK it at all	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 4 6 6
you got to take them for walks	3 6 6 6 3 6 7	3 6 3 1 6 6 6
a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child	2 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
are the major targets	6 7 5 5	6 2 6 6
in salary	7 5	6 6
weve weve talked our five minutes though	3 1 6 2 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
UNK because	7 6	6 4
when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm	6 3 6 6 2 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
ive ive heard that they were very good	3 1 6 6 2 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
so i took his suggestion	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 4
they pass your phone number on to another company	3 6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 4 4
they they consider them second class	6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4
well you know i ca ca imagine how i did	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
you go	3 6	6 6
so im im	6 3 1	6 6 6
different than what you have down there	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they UNK the steering column of course to steal the car	3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6
and they uh the minorities could not get	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
i think	3 6	6 6
theyve theyve got sixty or laughter-so of iraq iraq planes	3 1 6 7 5 5 2 3 1 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
near UNK um	2 4 6	6 6 6
but mostly petty things and nothing- nothing- nothing nothing really too big	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
and i think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and there there a town in georgia	6 6 6 7 5 5 2	6 3 1 2 4 4 4
uh playing the people that theyre theyre going to play then that might be pretty good indication	6 6 2 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
oh ill ill have less of a UNK problem	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know to	6 6 6	6 6 6
it gives you energy	3 6 3 7	3 6 6 6
the smokers you know how they have the	7 5 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
um UNK	6 2	6 6
and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
and then in the winter time it it jeans or	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and he pulled	6 3 6	6 3 6
built our home we were UNK some apartments that we were living in	6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
but um	6 6	6 6
he should address those problems	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
oh complete	6 6	6 6
uh it has around thirty hundred square feet	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 6 4 4
anyway we	6 3	6 6
and i want to scratch it out and put drafter	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
just hard finding the time	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
as a laughter-vote	6 7 5	6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
i mean it	3 6 3	6 6 6
well what do you think	6 7 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6
the topic today was	2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6
one one ten by ten	2 4 7 2 7	3 1 6 6 6
i think he ought to laughter-stay UNK UNK	3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
to go back to work	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6

not much else we do laughter-for vacation really	6 7 2 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
and and when you find someone like that that you know	6 6 6 3 6 3 2 3 1 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4
i think tv tv is bad because1 they uh show all sorts of violence on	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 7 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
seven or eight hours a day	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
well do you all have um	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6

for that	6 3	6 6
gardening or anything like that until now	2 7 3 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
it it depends on um	6 6 6 6 6	6 2 6 6 6
i do do believe criminal is in a court by itself	3 6 6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
good ideas or	7 5 6	6 6 6
uh it was a lot of fun you know	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i really should because there there so many self-improvement books out right now that would	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 6 6 3
well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
and UNK UNK UNK laughter-to laughter-be willing to pay for it and believe in it	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6

any of these the public uh stations you know	3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
then with uh	6 6 6	6 6 6

like fifteen by	6 7 2	6 6 6
the belts	2 4	2 4
you know any controls	6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6
and i do do think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4

when they talk about the nightly UNK	2 3 2 4 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
where i am the just like all the hospitals theyre theyre getting day care	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6
and either we made it	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 3
it seems like it would be	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
the fast moving water	2 4 4 4	2 4 6 6
you know how can you help depending on the day care center you know	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6

and ive ive got yeah and ive ive got a history of kingsley iowa	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
come in on these things	6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
and if youre youre a little bit UNK	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
he knew what was going to happen more than any of us	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
oh good	6 6	6 6

and they wo wo be able to have any drinking water because they will have	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
and then like the week before that they said go through your UNK	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4

the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree	6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
what is open for an UNK in different fields	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
theyve theyve um theyve theyve had police officers come in	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why	6 6 3 6 3 7 5 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
theyve theyve got trees	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
instead of becoming UNK to the teachers so that the uh the teacher teacher in the middle	6 6 6 7 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 7 5	6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it not	6 6 6	3 1 6
oh is it really	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 4
it increases each year i think	3 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 4 4 4 6 6 6 6
and they did	6 3 6	6 3 6
i think he has some interesting things on it	3 6 2 6 7 5 5 6 3	3 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3
as it is to	2 6 2 6	6 3 6 6
had to put in	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
i do do think you have to register a shotgun	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
washington it really is a uh	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 4 4 4
so he had to kind of get used to laughter-us laughter-when laughter-we first	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
when you know you buy cow manure at the store theyve theyve added stuff to it	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 7 5 3 1 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 1 6 6 6 6
boy wed wed like to get back over to the east coast	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
i mean i like	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
let let find a middle ground	6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4
and once youve youve established the fact that youre youre not a drug user and	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
some kind of colored shirt and a tie	7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
this is too scary	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i do do know what the name of it is anymore	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4
and it was sort of a	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
trying to keep the younger kid	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 2 6 4 6 6
i was trying to get my uh	3 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
before i had this car i had a um	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
things like that	7 5 2	6 6 6
and um is going to be uh entering north texas	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
and it it obvious you know the results of sex are quite UNK as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
but um oh just phenomenal	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
for example was the guy UNK	6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 4
knowledgeable about certain sorts of things	2 4 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
well i- i think-	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3
like jobs	6 7	6 6
that was just the ink	3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
it that bothers me because she she the UNK thing	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i mean you know what the news media media gonna gonna make of it	6 6 3 6 3 7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6

i mean he he he he so much fun now	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
i think this is like two years ago	3 6 3 6 6 7 5 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4

done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 3
do they not ever i mean i do do know that much do they not ever burn trash or	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
for all i know aerobics started out here	6 7 3 7 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
there was something on tv tv the other day that said that fewer than	6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 4
that would be nice	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in central park a couple of years ago	7 2 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
you mean the prisons	3 6 2 4	6 6 3 6
it it kind of like	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
laughter-i had had even thought about laughter-it	3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 2 4 4 4
um i wish i had	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and i think it was	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i do not know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
UNK of	7 5	6 6
does it does it on its little on its on the flower does it have a beard on it at all	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
i sit around and UNK with that most of the time	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
my pleasure	2 4	6 6
personally i think that that what i was about to say	6 3 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4
you know when you got that textured stuff	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
but they you know the UNK really picked up big here	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 4
they live lean for one thing	3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
probably is as UNK as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
well there is always the uh the possibility even UNK as it is of uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
actually i think it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
oh laughter-really	6 6	6 6
they never	3 6	6 6
oh UNK	6 6	6 6
UNK uh	2 4	6 6
and the people in various states it does does seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons	6 2 4 7 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
and you get your options youre youre looking at fifteen	6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
they were not the ones that had UNK that off that it was the national you know	3 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 2 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
consider getting a brand new cadillac because1 those are twenty	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
there there	6 6	6 1
that that probably like	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and this comes from	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
ive ive heard that that	3 1 6 3 1	3 1 6 1 6
i have never been able to make it through any of michener michener work	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i just thought it was so pretty	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
well it was was a lay over	6 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
oh that would be good	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i do do i do do uh	6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6

even from reagan it was all just like	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that has got to be blooming this time of year	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
mine did did did not fall into the gifted category	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over	6 6 6 3 6 7 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
but uh so i went to college and now since have completed two masters masters degrees	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
he he UNK it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
ive ive been real pleased	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
positive UNK or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh	7 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
we had one guy that could could throw	3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and milk jugs	2 7 5	6 6 4
it it they were UNK by the germans	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 4 4 6 2 4
they UNK that	3 6 2	6 6 6
central and south america	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
might be worth it for peace of mind	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 6 4 4
i had stuff for like UNK UNK	3 6 2 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
if it if it it just one more piece of something	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6
but kentucky we use to have severe i mean just real cold cold winters	6 6 7 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
so we do do have any any children yet	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh john UNK is in it if you do do UNK	6 2 4 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 3 1 6
at the end of seasons	6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
well i was i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 2 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
is it any of your business	6 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
were were gonna gonna talk about the public school system	3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
because1 my dogs UNK laughter-them1	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
excuse me i see it being done	6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
and without even UNK	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 4
by the a state	6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6
i just wondered	3 6 6	3 6 6
there there a	6 6 6	3 1 6
new york city for example	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 4 6 4
texas being a uh rebel state	2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
there there been too much negative reinforcement	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 4 4
i mean theyre theyre UNK by their children	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
and some people would get military service	6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the crime in the city	2 4 4 3 1	2 4 3 1 6
and i and so it was kind of like it it they	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
the brand	2 4	2 4
and then everybody goes that place	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
no doubt	6 6	6 6
well there there also the issue of uh	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
uh the shift in the UNK stream	7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 2 4 6 2 4 4
um and	6 6	6 6
he the beagle died in i guess about october	6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
you know putting them1 in prison my god that does does work	6 6 6 2 6 2 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
almost um	6 6	6 6
of course when the place in arlington	6 6 6 3 1 1 1	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
but it does mean that you	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that	3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
about projects	2 4	6 6
but um it was was necessarily	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 1 1 6
last year i had another- i had another german shepherd	2 4 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
that that all	3 1 7	3 1 6
of um	7 5	6 6
you bet	3 6	6 6
those who were watching it how easily	2 3 2 4 3 7 5	6 6 2 4 4 4 4
it was at night	6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6
no life threatening uh UNK uh	2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
the parents might be thirty years old	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	2 4 6 2 4 4 4
and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
you can always tell whenever theyre theyre cooked if theyve theyve been dead for a long time because1 their tail UNK out	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
my instructor pilot was a	2 4 4 6 2	3 6 6 6 6
hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five	2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i guess so	3 6 6	3 6 6
there there also you know some private ones	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6
uh a bunch UNK boys at one time	6 7 5 5 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
on my daughter	6 3 1	6 6 6
and i said i ca ca imagine	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and my sister uh she she the master of the fast order UNK you know	6 2 4 6 3 1 7 5 2 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 7 5 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
that that	6 6	6 1
i made an off off the UNK UNK about lawyers	3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 4 4
that that all fine and good	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6
freddy eats a nuclear UNK you know	3 6 7 5 5 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6
first of all theyre theyre missing	6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
i guess i	3 6 6	3 6 6
we were at the UNK market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that	3 6 6 7 5 5 2 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 3	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
but i you know im im real concerned that i- i do do want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
obviously there there uh	6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
so they have a lot of cattle in the area	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4
essentially the first thing is that- is on the order of you	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
im im i was going to go to little little river state park	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 4
it was	6 6	6 6
i think i like	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and i screw around and do do do it or wait too long or something	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 4 6 4
do you ever go see the rangers	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 6 6 6 2 4
promote the collection of taxes in this UNK	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
as far as uh UNK and things like that because1 theyve theyve got to get a chance to find the find the UNK in the rock	6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 2 4
last week	2 4	6 6
because1 uh	6 6	6 6
a lot so many different songs	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
i think that	3 6 6	3 6 6
it gets so humid	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
he was so excited about going	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
it has UNK and trees	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
i know in the state of florida just today uh the the legislature	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 7 6 2 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
but uh again uh that did did occur without a crisis	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
well things cost a lot more	6 7 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh it it very much like the military	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
because i know i certainly would would want to uh	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and and i quite frankly do do see anything wrong with it	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3
im im scared to death her going to public school	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
so i did that	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
various UNK that	7 5 3	6 6 6
well since im im kind of on the	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
but see theyre theyre	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in the UNK UNK	2 4 4 4	3 6 2 4
people will kind of set up their own little club	2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
you know people find ways around	6 6 2 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
and and that that	6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6
i do do know just have sort of like a a a UNK pool	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
convicted for	2 4	6 6
which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
three or four streams that UNK into it	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 1 6 6 6 6 3
oh most of the cars	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4
it came out right around the time with UNK UNK	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
um youre youre not supposed to i mean youre youre not supposed to eat them1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 6 2 4
but why not hit the points the kid kid really interested in	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4 4 6
just i feel- i feel like even that little bit helps	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
well uh i i do do do it as much as i should	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 2 4
anything political	3 2	6 6
as far as any maintenance on my car that i UNK away from	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on saturday or something like that	7 5 5 2 4 4 4 7 5 2 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6

oh im im trying to think	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
it might not be such a bad thing	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but i would would i would would say that i i completely like heavy metal	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 4 4 4 4
you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
for long periods of time	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
that that the neatest book weve weve got	3 1 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6
i think it it seven hundred fifty five families	3 7 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i thought well at least he was honest	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
to let me know that she was unhappy with laughter-what laughter-i laughter-did	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4
before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
if if you have	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
exotic pet shop	2 4 4	6 6 6
when i watch it	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 3
there there no doubt about it	6 6 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 6
a UNK level then or	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
mom went and-	7 6 6	6 6 6
young man who teenager you know	2 4 3 2 6 6	6 6 4 4 6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
huh oh those	6 6 3	6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
he showed it to me	3 6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
um trying to get- uh	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i have uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
all of those things	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
i agree	3 6	6 6
and before that there was the running UNK	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
is there anything missing	6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6
so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and uh when i did i you know i realized that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6
if the industry comes	6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6
my UNK accounting department will at the end of the month	2 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
and i did did have any problems	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4
bins through out the	2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
to be so UNK that they do lose sight of the basics you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4 6 6
well that did did go so- over now	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
oh well then you must know a lot more about this than i do	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
if id id of probably had three or four children	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 2 4 4
but uh i like to have them1	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them1 you know	6 6 6 6 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
my perception of the budget you know	2 4 4 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i definitely agree with parents	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
they save a lot of they save a lot of energy	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
youve youve got to start them1	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 4 4
or laughter-you can die	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
but i mean i i definitely agree with you	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6

my feelings were that we needed this bridge to	2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6
id id feel a little bit uneasy about	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6

some i do do	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4
i think they could uh save money	3 6 3 6 6 6 2	3 6 2 4 6 6 6
you probably ca ca afford to eat if you have more than two of them	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 2 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6

the person who sells the gun ought to	2 4 3 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3

but this is something to me that that sad	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
heavily enough to where they could get	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
couple of good years	7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
im im not kidding you	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 3

and the only school you could go to was the UNK school or the	6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 4 6 4 6 6 6
and if it it possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4

the world does not revolve around west virginia	2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
get one thing or another	6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
in a room	7 5 5	6 6 6

society society not going to put them to death	2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
matter of fact i did did make it completely through that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is	6 2 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6
things to us	2 6 3	6 6 6

and do they have the death penalty there	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and not doing anything with them	6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 3
you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that	6 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 6 3
in two of the areas in uh in the washington suburbs	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
and now he he a registered voter	6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 2 4 4
theyre theyre delicious	2 4 6	3 1 6
i- i agree with it	6 3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3
recycling drive	2 4	6 6
i try to catch it	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i heard it on the news today	3 6 3 6 2 4 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
they let her UNK their hair and and get on their back or whatever	3 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
we knew it	3 6 3	6 6 6
i i do do know you know	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think that	3 6 6	6 6 6
do you read um	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
well it it amazing just because of the drain it it been on you know both UNK that our economy is of course	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
i think	3 6	3 6
they get too boring	2 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
attic and looked around	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but it it not practical for me	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
um how do i feel about it	6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
there is a girl	6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6
if theyre theyre UNK	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
it it a dog eat dog world	3 1 7 6 7 6 7	3 1 2 4 4 4 4
as a matter of fact that was a very	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
the album oriented like the	3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
ive ive made a lot of bibs	3 1 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
that um	6 6	6 6
about twenty miles away from us	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6
oh gosh	6 6	6 6
not really you know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces	6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
try it out with their peers	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
like for drugs	6 6 6	6 2 6
end somebody else else life and in a lot of cases several people people lives	6 3 2 4 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
and he you were his slave	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and i my folks have always had	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
if if im im a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
and that is very UNK cause i have to wait -until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
certainly that that true in the overall	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
he does have some real	3 6 6 2 4	2 4 6 6 6
a UNK UNK	7 5 5	2 4 4
and then i was not chosen	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 4
well we went over to her house	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and i i just came from	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
i was limited	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh i do- i i do do think the judge should just make the decision alone	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
but like the friends other friends of mine have cats	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
same here	2 6	6 6
they do do UNK to be let loose	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
his preference is um	2 4 6 6	6 4 6 6
and she was was going to buy me something i was going to grow out	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3
is the the interviewing of jurors after the trial	6 6 2 4 7 2 6 2 4	6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4
that is what i did with my plants	3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 7 5 6 6 4
that that their big selling point uh other than	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 6
college UNK courses when you can	7 5 5 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
so it it got into the carpeting got into the floor	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
and now theyre theyre wanting to go back to the	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6
when theyre theyre when	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got	6 3 6 2 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 1 1 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
tried to	6 6	6 6
where we live out here in the north east it it it	6 7 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6
of one run games	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and what they did they had	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
a productive member of society	7 5 5 2 4	2 4 6 2 4
and i lived in uh outside of boston for five years	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
i guess violent crimes would be the	3 6 2 4 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
UNK reasonable and UNK	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
well youre youre not a starving artist yet are you	6 3 1 6 7 5 5 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6 3
that that the way things have gotten	3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 4 4 4 4
my husband is not a real big movie UNK	2 4 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know how it works exactly	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh is he	6 6 3	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and i	6 6	6 6
ive ive ive ive lived back east before	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
and were were	6 3 1	6 6 6
that that	3 1	6 1
how about1 you	6 6 3	3 6 6
well i should say on the west side	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6
and i uh kept that because she gave me that	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know	6 7	3 6
and i mean theyre theyre the first ones that take the brunt of everything	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 3 2 7 5 2 3	6 3 6 3 6 2 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4
the plano area is basically with UNK	2 4 4 6 6 6 2	2 4 6 6 6 6 4
troops that have been	2 3 2 4	6 6 3 6
more than one person	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
but he he reading it	6 3 1 6 3	3 6 6 6 3
and all of his teachers were very good	6 7 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
so it it the same age bracket	6 6 6 3 1 1 1	6 3 1 2 4 4 4
and were were just going to have to adopt a	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 3
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
UNK to attract people people attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that	6 6 6 3 1 2 3 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
you know and and so they may be even better- better this year	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i certainly do	3 6 6	6 6 6
it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4
an invasion that turns out to be not UNK	2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
he he got off right away	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
people could have got a raise	2 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6
oh i have have ever talked that long	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i have have ever really looked at them	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but i i really much much like the hometown area	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
um uh human factors	6 6 2 4	6 6 4 4
i- i did grow up with david brinkley	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
because when you do have to be in front of people	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well texas has uh texas has uh has always struck me	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
and theyre theyre they were doing it at their own costs	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
or if that seems like a real UNK place to where you could	6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
and then	6 6	6 6
you know	6 2	6 6
they uh they really dress up all the time	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i mean it it not	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
that are about- our age	3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
an invasion	2 4	6 6
we took it back	2 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
a dealing with is like a credit bureau	7 5 6 6 6 7 5 5	2 4 6 3 6 2 4 4
proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this	6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
he gets on national television and and says that you know	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
and i can see what i please	6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store	2 4 4 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
so that that has a lot to do with it	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 6	6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6
at because nobody it seemed like liked the same thing	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 4
it seems to me that it still should	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
we all know that that that not	3 7 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they did did call you for mother mother day	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
people still use it enough in like in	2 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
i do do know state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association	3 6 6 6 7 5 3 2 7 2 3 6 6 7 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
oh boy	6 6	6 6
because there are some cases when you just do do know	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 3 1 6
you know any felony anyways	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4
UNK for the	6 6 2	6 6 6
he laughter-could laughter-he laughter-could laughter-of UNK UNK laughter-else	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2	2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
i came from a house in colorado which had the cathedral ceilings	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 4 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
get anything	6 3	6 6
so i have to throw them1 away cause there is no place to take glass	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
it seems anymore uh a movie can not be considered good unless there there just some	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 4
we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer	3 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
the other thing to do if you really- really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them	2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 3 1 2 3 2 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3 6 7 5 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 1 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 3
virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are	3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 2 4 7 3 2 4 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
it it twelve years old	2 4 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and then they had uh	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 4 6
i figure well youre youre baking it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 3 1 6 6
and those are so neat	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
they they lead themselves down hopeless UNK	6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 4 4
theyre theyre going to other neighborhoods from there	3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
uh the roof	6 3 1	6 6 6
turning around just now you know trying to be UNK	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it would	3 6	6 6
what were were more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city	3 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 7 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
i i think that eventually	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
it was a lot of fun	3 6 7 5 2 4	3 6 3 6 2 4
uh reward or whatever	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
that that	3 1	3 1
i do do have a sprinkler system	3 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
driving an airplane or driving a bus or	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 7	6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6
uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that red cross	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 3 2 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i guess if that that all weve weve done	3 6 6 3 1 7 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing	2 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
or theyve theyve got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 3
and i think theyve theyve got a UNK uh some kind of	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and i dont- i do do know how many times ive ive seen it	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3
my brother brother like that	3 1 1 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
she does	3 6	6 6
uh weve weve actually had some warnings in uh raleigh	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
that is a riot	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
and they had a little uh theater company	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
but uh he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i came back	3 6 6	6 6 6
a lot of UNK in it	7 5 5 5 6 3	3 6 6 4 6 6
like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know as- as i said i do	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
say the end of the civil war	2 7 5 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 4
and i have have been back to des moines in a long time	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
they get it at school and come home	3 6 3 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
do it	6 3	6 6
but that has changed a lot	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
we do do i mean we do a lot of little trips around here um	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
health health related	2 4 4	2 6 4
they have	3 6	6 6
it it would just depend	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4
i mean you have to find out whether there there a UNK UNK	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 4 4
handed in	7 5	6 6
i do do think that they could be objective in every case every time	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
and she she got two day cares within like three blocks of each other	6 3 1 6 3 1 1 6 6 7 5 5 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that like when my UNK	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 3
in other words youve youve increased the UNK of somebody being caught a little bit	6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 6 6 6	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
it is a bulb	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
do you remember	6 3 6	6 3 6
women women novels set in the civil war john UNK one	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
i know she she not doing it on purpose	3 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
or do you just not do you feel like it it not really going to make that much difference if you do do vote	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 6
you just have to	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you know by by UNK	6 6 6 6 7	3 6 6 6 4
i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6	2 4 6 6 7 4 6 2 4 4 4
and what theyre theyre going to be doing when they get laughter-out	6 7 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the little um	2 4 4	6 6 6
two days before his sentence was up	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
maybe it was in UNK	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4
that that a good idea	3 1 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 4
it it just incredible	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
usually the the person UNK does does pay	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 1 6
what are some other ones ive ive seen lately	7 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
in other words	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh the UNK uh of the taxes in certain areas UNK is is correct	6 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 4
and they were having a hard time	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 3 1 6
all right	6 6	6 6
but again it it going to be the law UNK citizen that that going to UNK with that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
put some good music on in there for her every once in a while	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless youve youve been there	3 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 3 1 6 6
i um	6 6	6 6
and we walked through the fence out	6 2 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6
you are legal in in your UNK of that law	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
there there a lot of them out there that have have	6 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so um	6 6	6 6
uh they get back up	6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
you know the type of weather	6 6 2 4 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
or something like that	2 3 2 3	6 6 6 6
but kentucky kentucky beautiful	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
i mean they probably became UNK physically and other things to the point that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 7 5 5	3 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
rather than just little fish	6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with	7 5 5 5 3 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6
and when it	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
and i	6 6	6 6
i was living in northern jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it	3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
UNK this random testing program	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
even today are graduating from school	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6 4
got the reputation to be	7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6
but they find that that- that- there there a connection between that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i mean	6 6	6 6
texas it	3 6	6 6
it looks like it would hold the soil	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you remember when UNK UNK was a quarterback	3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but uh i i myself am in favor of it	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
do do do do be looking around like youve youve never been there before and you have no idea where you are	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 7	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
i really ca ca say for certain	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
there there so many UNK	6 6 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 6
national ties	7 5	6 6
in texas	7 2	6 6
i took the clip out or whatever	3 6 2 4 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh well theyre theyre theyre theyre coming from various places	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i think you can	3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
fall but the year after that	2 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 2 4
you know with a with as	6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
uh the logistics of the thing that uh	6 7 5 5 2 4 3 7	6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
maybe it was during the interview	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
and they say uh-huh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
or eighty	2 4	6 6
we seem to be UNK here	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
ive ive never heard of that before	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4
to see that theyre theyre not being	2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6
somewhere down the line they went standardized	6 6 7 5 2 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
boy UNK troops or church groups or	2 4 4 4 7 5 2	6 6 6 2 4 4 6
and uh it it one thing	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
i did did realize a cow one cow produces that much manure	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
but im im sorry i got it	6 3 1 6 3 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and uh a big percentage of that was used up	6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
and i	6 3	6 6
costner on the UNK awards	2 6 2 4 4	6 6 4 4 4
course youre youre familiar with the ti ti drawing	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know i do do want to get out there UNK hunting and have some guy blow me away	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
uh eight ninety uh	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4
watching the news	6 2 4	6 6 6
bureaucracy and in the politics of it	7 6 6 7 5 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 6 6
and it was only like	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
the ticket	6 6	6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
oh that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
oh really	6 6	6 6
UNK now ten years old	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
or something like that they get very much well you know it it just a big UNK company- corporation	2 3 2 3 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4
and and your occupation is	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6
so do you have a big family	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but for aluminum that that real nice	6 6 2 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and uh the way in which	6 6 7 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 2 4
and we we cut them1 up and sent them back because we we had had even UNK for them	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3
or more from the navy	2 4 7 2 4	6 6 6 2 4
i do do really need one in the	3 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i had a lawn service to do my yard for me	3 6 7 5 5 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3
i mean theyre theyre theyre	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
so where do you live at	6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
well i	6 3	6 6
that you ca ca work	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 4 4 4
all right	6 6	6 6
for me i would would have time to	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
but at night they even have the policemen come around at UNK	6 6 2 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and theyre theyre absolutely wonderful	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
four or five years	7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6
but it was a drug	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
twelve people you know	2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6
theyre theyre theyre theyre affectionate	6 6 3 1 6	3 1 3 1 6
i will bet you those are dutch iris	3 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
and i	6 6	6 6
and that is a really good movie if you like special effects	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4
i think uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
well and that i think that that maybe part of it that that the	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and you do do go to baseball games as much	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
what you mean	7 3 6	6 6 6
what would be the first thing youd youd cut	7 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
but um there seemed to be enough UNK in there you know left to do that	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
uh were were able to uh	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
but more you see these commercials that have	6 6 3 6 7 5 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and uh	7 5	6 6
and i thought well gosh that must be pretty good	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i did did care for the type of movie	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 6
and weve weve already started about you know	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre not enforcing the death penalty itself	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4
and i started doing that at work	6 3 6 6 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
no matter what it is if it it a limited edition it it usually worth something later on	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
so she said UNK it it for you	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 6 6
i do do know how it is there	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
especially on electronic goods	6 6 2 4	6 6 4 4
you know so that theyre theyre not	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i mean they have like uh	6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
and they had it	6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6
they are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the UNK	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 7 5 6 2 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
i mean i feel really sorry for these people	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6
well good	6 6	6 6
they bring their their UNK home	3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
and it it too bad	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
well they UNK UNK they can i think in the punishment phase	6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but uh that they uh are much more UNK	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
it it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh that almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6 7	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6
are are going to be UNK over there over the	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i mean i do do	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6
thousands and thousands of UNK that uh going through it in a day	7 5 5 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
im im very UNK for it	3 1 6 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 6 3
UNK UNK you know all those kinds of things	7 5 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
just change our priorities a little bit	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 4
uh it was	6 3 6	6 6 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
it it so hard to UNK here	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
where there are more than one family in a house	2 6 2 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
that that coming up here pretty soon	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
just in some of the um	6 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
it it a a who	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 3
now and then and ill ill tell you	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
if it	6 3	6 6
so education	6 6	6 4
the the public service thing again	6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 4 4 6 6
and it was	6 6 6	6 6 6
but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
that that just UNK it	3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 3
uh lists for phone solicitations	6 7 5 5 5	2 4 4 4 4
and it it certainly and it it certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4	6 3 1 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
i like jazz music	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
uh it seems like there there so much that goes to things that do do really do a whole lot of good	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 1 2 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
uh uh a poodle	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 7 5 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
well im im a im im a practicing vegetarian	6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
laying out can be	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6
and i would never have said so either	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6
uh yeah	6 6	6 4
i wish i could	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
i thinking all our cd cd that we have what i really laughter-like	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
that they	6 3	6 6
oh is that right	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 4
i know	6 6	6 6
but um it makes them crunchy	6 6 2 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
little kids can just you know UNK all over her	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
alternative occasionally that i like to use	7 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
they let this	3 6 2	3 6 6
the basics	2 4	6 6
for the	6 7	6 6
and so uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though	3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6
my backyard is uh is UNK	2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
whatever the top said the rest fell you know UNK and file in behind it	3 7 5 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 3	6 2 4 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
make their UNK and stuff- to	7 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6
at that time anyway	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
dig it out and make sure	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
but diner is really worth seeing	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh he has a dog and everything	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6
how about revenge	6 6 2	3 6 6
but they got it for a friend	6 3 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
unless an employer has a	6 2 4 6 7	6 2 4 6 6
you know between it and rap	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
you know how they can do some of the UNK	6 6 6 3 6 6 7 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
also with uh with work	6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
now do you think that that because	6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 6 3 1 6
i i mean i basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 4 4 4 4 4
we taught them how to do it	3 6 2 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
do UNK work	6 2 4	6 6 6
uh no	6 6	6 6
but they would would take them1	6 3 6 6 6 3	2 4 6 6 6 6
becoming a great power financially	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4
but with	6 6	6 6
and i	6 3	6 6
that that not really good	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
that the sales UNK drive around in	3 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
because1 uh that just	6 6 3 6	6 2 6 6
and i guess i i guess	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
they are	3 6	6 6
people are just	2 6 6	6 6 6
see i was raised in the midwest which you know	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
and that im im sure that would make a big difference too	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
got a pretty fair amount of snow	6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
the problem is we are all really UNK around	7 5 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
he can walk	3 6 6	3 6 6
i do do blame you	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3
an UNK	7 5	3 6
what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we ca ca UNK it	7 6 6 2 4 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
and their cats you know their their so use to the attention	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and usually they are	6 6 3 6	6 4 6 4
is ive ive got the	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
you know used to drop mice in it	6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
we even	6 6	6 6
oh jeez	6 6	6 6
it it definitely different	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
i do do think there there so much of a problem there	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh gee she hated baths worse than anything	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh after that	2 4 3	6 6 6
it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
and were were like well why do do we go see this now	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
it it been a pleasure talking to you	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 3	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6
that you do do know when	7 3 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6
they actually should do some reading	3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
that that	6 6	3 1
but they put out UNK chemicals there	6 2 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
we do	3 6	6 6
i do do know what wed wed replace it with	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3
and of course	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh if you read it	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
uh scallops	6 6	6 4
UNK UNK or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that	2 4 7 2 4 4 4 7 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
where am i	6 6 3	6 6 6
of a toy UNK a toy poodle	6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 4 6 4 4 4
laughter-you laughter-know	6 6	6 6
and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
we were UNK	3 6 6	6 2 4
are all double	6 6 2	6 6 6
they could could figure out what had happened	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
well let let see	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
whose whose your favorite UNK or actor	7 5 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 4 5 4 4
i kind of gotten into	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
who was the quarterback	7 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
and just be a little	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 6
my dad dad like that	2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
i was driving a sixty	3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
how did you put that many miles on it in	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
it it it it a lot of that	6 6 3 1 7 5 2 3	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
you know when- when you consider	6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 4
and was the UNK reasonable given the UNK	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4	3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
theyre theyre UNK lots of money around	2 4 4 7 5 5 2	3 1 6 6 6 4 4
big red	2 4	6 6
that it could happen	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
just keeping your UNK about you and you trying not to look like a victim	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
so i said well it just crossed in the mail	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
that one looks so scary just from the UNK	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that the thing	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
um that that	6 3 1	6 6 6
but she got UNK for it	6 3 6 7 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 3
and i think that uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
um his father	6 2 4	6 6 4
the funny thing there is theyre theyre not particularly welcome back home	2 4 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
uh the other one is uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
but it just really depends on the weather and my mood	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
it it very UNK	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
oh the social	6 6 6	6 6 6
the mpv mpv mpv is more of uh	3 1 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 4 4 6 6 6 4
was traditionally known as UNK	2 4 4 4 3	2 4 6 6 4
it has no there there no call for something violent	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
but lots of times you do do even see the signs on the bottles	6 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
it it more	6 6 6	3 1 6
a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and and robbing them	7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 6 7 5 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
but uh no	6 6 6	6 6 6
i never have either	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
it it almost like they do do want the paper	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
too far	6 6	6 6
and i i read a lot for school	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 7 6 6 4
i UNK someone that can do that you know	3 6 3 1 2 4 3 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
so apparently it was the same one that was on there	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6
and and it it not it it not just that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6
and then she got sick on me again	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 2 7 5 3 1 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
this position	2 4	6 6
i mean it it a little dinky town	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4
we did did tell her when	3 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
like stay out	6 6 6	6 6 6
uh airplanes	2 4	6 6
that that that that funny you said that because we got a credit card um my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 2 4 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
UNK ethic	3 1	6 6
that seems like youve youve thought this through quite a bit before	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 3 1 6
my parents through the	2 4 6 6	2 4 6 6
to do it	6 6 3	6 6 6
i can talk	3 6 6	3 6 6
well it does it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and the cat cat just looking at me like sorry	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
third of december	7 2 4	6 2 4
they want to see all the horror movies	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4
stand for itself that	6 6 3 6	6 6 4 6
there was	6 6	6 6
for only a certain amount	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4
a program to teach them to use the american money	2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean i like-	6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6
do do know you know	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
of anyone that that anyone had ever known	7 3 7 3 1 7 5 5	2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6
by the year two thousand there will	6 2 4 7 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
late fifties	3 1	6 6
so i guess the worst problem i ever had with	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6
being UNK and raising kids UNK	6 2 6 6 2 6	6 6 2 4 4 4
and mechanical engineering interested me	6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
burning out of control in	7 5 5 6 7	6 6 6 6 6
this is a little bit of the subject	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and uh it it it it all on	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
i- i see it all too often	6 3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but i do do like the broncos	6 3 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
most everybody seems pretty well employed	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
laughter-you laughter-know	6 6	6 6
and even though they told us in advance that you could	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
i kind of remember back when gas prices started up	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 4
i enjoyed the big family	3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
and it was definitely voluntary too	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 6
up there in frederick	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
being from baltimore of course im im a big barry levinson fan since uh he he he you know he he done a bunch of baltimore movies	6 6 2 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
well like um	6 6 6	6 6 6
and that that not really the answer i mean because1 if theyre theyre UNK theyll theyll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that	6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 7 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
now see i would have never figured that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6
but i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
maybe on smaller	6 6 6	6 2 4
well that that a good idea	6 3 1 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6
so i did did i did did make any noise about it	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
he he a very odd odd man	3 1 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 4 4
and if a mechanism is put into place	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
income tax and no sales tax	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
oh she do do even know how	6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
there are other people that feel the same way	6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
and uh they usually get you know they they make things very	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6
well i have	6 3 6	6 6 6
then they made a book up about it	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 1 6 6 6
that that okay	3 1 6	3 1 6
because1 she wo wo be able to cash checks because1 most places UNK through there	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
not during the trial	6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
those little kids do do understand it	2 4 4 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 1 6 6
so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 4 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and then they are out doing it again	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and ive ive enjoyed our talk	6 3 1 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6
they probably did did know what they were talking about	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
and another-	6 6	6 6
are they gonna be taught something	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh i was recording	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4
and you know theyre UNK theyre regulation that that placed on them is	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and i do	6 3 6	6 6 6
but that that one good thing	6 3 1 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 3
but i find attitudes are	6 3 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 6
i do do know something something got to change with the schools	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 2 4
it it like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while youre youre gone	6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 3 2 4 7 2 4 4 4 3 1 2	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 4
because if he he interested he he going to study it	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
maybe we do we need some more catholic schools	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the other	6 6	6 6
or you ca ca get a UNK license	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 1 6
and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking	7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
laughter-it laughter-just laughter-does laughter-does UNK laughter-good	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6
because1 i have one that i do do have a pin number for	6 3 6 7 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
and i was so happy there	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
is a	6 6	6 6
and you know they experience a lot more	6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
on the inside	6 2 4	6 3 6
and so that was	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
that was what twelve years ago i guess	3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh that	6 3	6 6
is uh UNK up	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
my daughter	3 1	6 6
and also i noticed in canada they uh	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4
i think youre youre right	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
police chief of the town	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
and so i wind up going out camping with	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it was was as important to them that they test me regularly	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
is a flower bed	2 4 4 4	6 2 6 6
you know people get fired	6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
changing in the future	6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4
a guy who was there as a uh foot soldier	7 5 3 1 1 1 7 5 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it just uh too much	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 4
it really frightens me though as far as the	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
the demand is so high that uh you know they were going to UNK them around like third you know	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6
most- most of them1 do	6 7 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
but you have to say at what point is is the help becoming negative	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 5 6 4 4 4
oh really	6 6	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
people they committed the crime against	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 6
especially for handguns	2 4 4	6 6 4
and it it a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
im im i- i do do know what other foe that would be	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6	6 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
because1 i did some teaching part-time	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
plants that are just spring UNK	2 3 2 4 7 5	6 6 2 4 4 4
one time that was in pittsburgh	2 4 3 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 2 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
do you	6 3	6 6
going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i do do think	6 6 2 6 7 5 5 6 6 7 2 4 4 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
some of the some of the women women roles i think are almost for the worse because were were losing out on some things going back to work	6 6 6 7 2 3 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6
and im im im im	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 1
well i think that	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 3
where there there uh UNK to their own life and other people people lives	2 6 6 2 7 5 2 4 4 7 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it	6 6	3 1
particularly in some of the housing projects	6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean i think you know normally they they may get out	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4
it that that that that	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 5
because1 i was selling it	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 3
but um she used to have you know two dozen sticky buns three bread UNK you know every week	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
i do do	3 6 6	3 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
well we could talk about that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 3
he just did did make that kind of money with five children	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
i had i had an eighty	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
and then the friend	6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4
so it was	6 6 6	6 6 6
and well well uh	6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6
or so	6 6	3 6
um wrongly	6 6	6 6
and second of all	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
and the thing that they forgot to do was to	6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4
and a lot more games right	6 2 4 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
has has	6 6	3 1
i think it was a three fifty	3 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 4 6 3 6 6 6
seems like it it a good safe number to pick you know	6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6
but if youve youve UNK it down to one or two	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
um ive ive found that when i i do do have cable television anymore uh when i moved	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 4
i said my goodness what is it UNK in gold you know uh	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
buying power over the age you know under the age of thirty or so to	7 5 2 4 4 6 2 4 7 5 5 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
percentage of drug related type things are	7 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 2 4 4 6 4 4
you know and use this thing to you know UNK the take the stuff out and put it in the UNK and everything	6 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i really do do know that much about it	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
and and well of course the you know	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
so it it got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
the social structure of the soviet union you know it it it it it coming apart at the UNK	7 5 5 2 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 6 3 1 2 1 4 4 6 2 4
the question was about uh	2 4 6 6 6	6 4 6 4 6
for example um	6 6 6	6 6 6
unless youre youre sort of clearly of an	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3
to make it an	6 6 3 7	2 4 4 4
well you know theyve theyve been talking about	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6
this guy had supposedly uh UNK this woman	7 5 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
you know it it their money	6 6 3 1 2 4	6 6 3 1 6 6
you know low mileage and in good shape	6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
it it it it sad though that um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and the snow all over the place	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
i think they should	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
wider the shot gets	6 7 5 6	6 6 6 6
what what going to happen to the UNK that are	7 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
to UNK you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know	6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i had a dump truck come and dump it	3 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
to ten then they come over- on and say oh youve youve extended your limit	6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 4
what it works out to	3 1 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6
oh wow	6 6	6 6
this does does really work anyway	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 4
good point	7 5	6 6
theyre theyre a lot	3 1 6 6	3 1 2 4
i- i guess you work for ti ti	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
from taxes	6 2	6 4
and then when it gets wet	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
id id rather have have	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and uh i do do know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
UNK or something knocked it out	7 5 5 6 3 6	6 2 4 6 6 6
it it true	3 1 6	3 1 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
like i uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
it it not as much fun	3 1 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
so that	6 6	6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
well right now our laws are so liberal that uh	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i think i checked that as a question id id be willing to discuss laughter-too	3 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4
but the problem is that you ca ca put	6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
but theyre theyre just so spread out on UNK and stuff that it it not you know a problem	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and i	6 6	6 6
because1 i did did realize that um	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i think if youre youre going into like uh law	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and there there only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
i guess there was even a	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
by tim UNK	2 4 4	3 6 6
uh there there one science fiction writer named uh allen UNK foster	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
and your defense attorney presents their evidence	6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 4
uh you know i i sit at a UNK and and write software all day	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
i mean there there no doubt	6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 3 1
it does	3 6	6 6
and they would would come back	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3
is it formal policy that they said they might	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
well i know uh	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
better i do do think	2 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and i i do like um UNK	6 6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
all your life	3 1 1	6 6 6
i do do think jim kelly is about to be swayed away from the bills any time-	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 3
really interested in legal	6 6 6 6	6 4 6 4
oh that would be a mess	6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
and theyre theyre never going to let liquor in there	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
whereas yeah in a smaller	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
things like that	2 4 3	6 6 6
no it killed ours	6 3 6 2	6 6 6 6
for one thing	6 2 4	6 6 6
and id id id id	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
the exact uh UNK are for texas	2 4 4 4 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then all these	7 5 2 4	6 6 6 4
that thered be	2 6 2	6 6 6
if if somebody somebody about to	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6
no morals	2 4	6 6
yeah social changes is that	6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
so i like	6 3 6	6 3 6
different uh a few different uh hybrid tea type	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
you know by force	6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
why do uh is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
and once they have your number they have	6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it it it something around sixty sixty	6 6 6 3 7 5 5	3 1 6 6 4 4 4
that would be great	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
or is it just	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
segment that he said that if the money	2 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
but that that	6 6 6	6 6 6
at the age that she she at now	3 7 5 3 1 1 7 5	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i hear of one every now and then	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know that that a	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 1 6
friends at work	2 4 4	6 6 4
and there was this	6 6 6 7	6 6 6 6
think you know for a stephen	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4
UNK UNK UNK UNK	2 4 4 4	2 4 4 4
that we had had even UNK for	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 6
i mean you think theyre theyre UNK	6 6 3 6 3 1 2	2 6 6 6 3 1 6
and then you know the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 3 1 1 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
have you ever noticed theyre theyre always like a family owned center	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
they call it the um UNK bread here	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
really scary to me	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
you go through the the general UNK of	3 2 4 4 7 5 5 2	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i mean it does does happen very often because it it just an accident	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
i was careful to keep her away from the	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
but the reason they had to do this was because so many people	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
well im im not sure theyre theyre	6 3 1 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so then it becomes a kind of music of it own so to speak	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 6
five are i mean four of them are grown	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
probably go back again this winter	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
and i-	6 6	6 6
but in the summer	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 4
and theyre theyre just UNK	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
but there there a	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i really liked it	3 6 6 3	2 4 6 6
and all the	6 6 6	6 6 6
that that	3 1	3 1
i just think employers have to have some kind of way	3 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
is that girl	6 3 6	6 6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
my goodness	6 6	6 6
i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
if if if they keep giving everybody	6 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
the UNK it comes in	2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
not having to take everything	7 5 5 5 3	6 4 4 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
oh what do they call those the uh	7 3 7 3 7 3 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
because1 i just watch them over and over again	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that ive ive really gotten into reading	6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
um in that	6 6 6	6 6 6
but uh	6 6	6 6
into playful little	6 7 5	6 4 6
well i used to watch sixty minutes until they did	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
but somewhere in	6 6 6	6 6 6
everytime everytime they have snow on the ground everything everything closed up	7 5 3 7 3 1 1 1 1 1 6 6	3 1 6 2 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6
wish i could vote on more things frankly	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
theyre theyre not all boys	3 1 6 6 7	3 1 6 6 6
that that why we hire people who uh you know to to make these decisions for us	3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
and i- i said	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
and and- it can be good for them too	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood	3 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 4
what program you in	2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6
ibm ibm ibm uh	2 4 4 6	2 4 4 4
running them up too high except at christmas	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
they wanted to um	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh well i do do actually live in the city	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
felonies on your record	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
uh all information	2 4 4	3 1 6
and i thought well that that okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 3 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
offend them uh if they if they were were	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it was too bad	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
UNK the tigers because	6 2 4 6	6 6 4 4
that that not	3 1 6	3 1 6
and fill pot holes and you know and	6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4
uh that that was interesting	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well that that	6 6 6	6 6 4
i know we did in the military	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
the um the rifle that ive ive got is not registered	6 6 2 4 3 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4
anything can go	3 6 6	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
uh you just were were just happy that there there trees already there so far	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 1 6 6 4 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
as there is no real smoking gun	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
three i think that i know of	7 3 2 3 1 2 4	6 2 4 6 2 6 6
where are you calling from by the way	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
that is crime where they UNK	3 6 2 6 2 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
this war	3 1	6 6
UNK a little UNK this and that	2 4 4 4 3 2 3	6 3 6 4 6 6 6
so far as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different UNK you would have to have a party in every UNK	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
i did did know that	3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
nowadays they have the UNK controls on them	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
youre youre welcome	3 1 6	3 1 6
for instance uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
it- it- it it just so complicated	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 4
neither i mean there there plans there	6 6 6 6 6 7 6	6 3 6 6 1 6 6
i had ordered a sofa	3 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 2 4
that we see	3 1 7	6 3 6
looked like it was a very very small UNK	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
i have three	3 6 7	3 6 6
i remember i had an old uncle up by UNK oklahoma that took me out	3 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 3 7 3 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
sort of what drove me to denton	6 6 3 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it was a seventy mile trip everyday	6 6 7 5 5 5 5	3 6 2 4 4 4 4
the smog and	2 4 4	6 6 6
you never heard about that	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
there there	6 6	3 1
well lawyers help UNK that	6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 4
and what do you do with it	6 7 6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 2 6 6 6
you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 7 5	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
you laughter-know when their parents come	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
doing drugs in the home	2 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4
i think i can leave them home	3 6 3 6 6 2 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6
he always uses it to	3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
if you did not want to do it	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
uh dig their own UNK	7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
and uh so it it had that UNK for quite sometime sometime	6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
thought um that i have have been trying	2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i would have figured that to be a lot more than laughter-that	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
i just i do do know	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6
and i mean your your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
drug trafficking they just kill you	2 4 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
oh youre youre right	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
an increased amount of of surrogacy	7 5 5 5 5 5	2 4 4 6 6 4
on the outside	6 2 4	6 3 6
to go either as an apprentice which they	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
well did you watch the program the other night on um	6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 7 5	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i i listened	6 3 6	6 3 6
my personal opinion	2 4 4	2 6 6
i know dallas is	3 6 2 6	3 6 6 6
theyre theyre all	3 1 6	3 1 6
but they theyre theyre already uh have UNK three strikes against them when theyre theyre out there	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 3 1 6 6
well that was uh that was a short UNK engine	6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 6 6
have a more solid	6 2 4 4	6 2 6 4
and it it UNK their credit	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
and the recycle ones are better to use	6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 3 4 6 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
so why are are you helping us	6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 1 2 4 6
and they just laughed at me	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 3
uh the	6 6	6 6
when i was home i still cooked a lot	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
there are certainly parts of town	6 6 6 7 2 3	6 2 6 6 6 6
criminal or something like that that different	6 6 3 2 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 1 6
UNK UNK UNK	7 5 5	2 5 1
im im convinced that the small	3 1 6 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 4
is what im im doing	6 3 1 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
and they make uh oh about a foot high plant	6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and brando like	6 3 6	6 6 6
but what somehow or another they attract	6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 4 6 4 4 4
to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening	6 7 5 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
valet with baseball tickets	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 4
and uh it really does make a difference	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4
i know i i spent thirty years in education here in the dayton area	3 6 6 3 6 7 5 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4
missiles and things were expended	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 2 4
would that be uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
oh great	6 6	6 6
uh the idea of UNK privacy for the individual	2 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
i mean the book is is UNK	3 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 2 4 4 6 4
oriole game	3 1	6 6
with all the electronic equipment that that around these days to	6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6
well i i live in an apartment building	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and then they have	6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4
and the woman stayed home and took care of them	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh i liked those two movies of his a lot	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
what do you what do you think of UNK UNK	6 6 6 7 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4
im im probably going to hear about it the rest of laughter-my laughter-life	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole union	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
and we	6 3	6 6
i do do know why	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
and then i was um i decided well i like this author	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 4
i do do care what anybody tells you	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6
rather than having a bunch of UNK people we can have educated people	6 6 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
well there must be a a a a a very great degree of that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
so no one else would have known	6 3 1 2 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
my uh ex-wife had said	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 4 6 6
through the public mind	7 5 5 5	6 3 4 6
when you get the most	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
i mean from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand	6 6 6 2 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 3 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
and so you know those do do take much time at all	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
high school education	7 5 5	6 6 6
when they were living in israel it was	6 2 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i have have	3 6 6	6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and we all love pickles	6 2 7 6 3	6 6 6 2 4
leaving the home and going out to work	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
it was	6 6	6 6
i think it it somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 3 6 3 4 6 4 4
there there there there always a reason why theyre theyre on sale	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 1 2 4
just came back from there	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i like talking to new people	3 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
well since since texas and louisiana and uh california that in that UNK order the worst pollutants in america	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
so were were probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see godfather part three somewhere	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4
you know they they understood that the UNK of the country were	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 3 1 7	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
no it it upper middle class uh kind of an environment	6 3 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4 6 4 4
and i moved him which was an extremely UNK experience	6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
if they do bring somebody on	7 3 7 5 3 7	6 3 6 6 6 6
and both people are working	6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
it was about uh	6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 2 4 7 2 4 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
and like you said save the commentaries	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 2 6 6 6 4
suppose uh	6 6	6 6
i well i do do because1 i work all day	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
last spring	2 4	6 6
well right now im im looking at a little	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and were were	6 2 4	6 6 6
how to write an answer and you know how to UNK a thought process	6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4

on the uh credit card bill	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6

but um we use to have uh	6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh two and a half baths	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 6
theyre theyre going crazy	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
you just sort of	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 3
you know into more violent crimes	6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4
the regular place where it it	2 4 4 4 4 4	2 4 6 6 6 4
now theyve theyve	6 3 1	6 6 6
if you want if you want to go UNK hunting and your birthday birthday after	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
but uh there there you know	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6
what what if youre youre not doing it	6 7 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
uh no	6 6	6 6
i used	6 6	6 6
other obvious things like that	2 4 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6
and they have to	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
so we all had to take lessons	6 7 5 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and they wanted us to have more brick	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
other things	2 4	6 6
do you	6 3	6 6
i do do have any now	3 6 6 6 7 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
they they dress	6 3 6	6 6 6
and then uh we we go on from there	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and then do you know that number	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
my um	2 4	6 6
but would would you think he would	6 6 6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3
she she a lot more UNK about her opinions and	3 1 7 5 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6
in trying to	2 4 4	3 6 6
but but he he excused from that	6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 1 6 6 3
but i do have friends who live in the city	6 3 6 6 7 3 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
how you get the edge	6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
rather an UNK one in the northern hemisphere	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
much of a rush really be able to enjoy it	7 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
so there was no UNK at all	6 6 6 7 5 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
not give anybody a chance to beat them1	6 6 3 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i uh	6 6	6 6
uh just	2 4	6 6
keep UNK you about it	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
become kind of UNK because there there been so many layoffs with big companies including texas instruments	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
and she turned out to be wonderful	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it is	6 6	6 6
so youd youd better wear a suit	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
all that	3 1	6 6
for herself too	6 3 6	6 4 6
we we just built a real big	6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
for yourself i guess you know	7 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
he ca ca hear me	3 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3
oh that is that is the most precious movie	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
does seem that	6 6 6	6 6 6
or send them1 to private schools	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
i mean it had-	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
wait the war was was until the UNK you know	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
do you follow professional sports at all	6 3 6 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
did you ever get to watch any of the uh new orleans games	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4
i had gone over to UNK	3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 2 4
now i	6 6	6 6
she gets home UNK by this state- uh	3 6 7 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4
UNK shot into the present time	7 5 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
uh how about1 you	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
using either illegal drugs or UNK alcohol	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it was an easy decision	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6
that that quite right either	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and um	6 6	6 6
and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
force or whether it called a military pact	3 7 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4
well im im sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 4 4 6 2 4
um a lot of the the things that are going on in today today society	7 5 5 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
now my UNK on the other hand he is a power user	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
oh sure	6 6	6 6
anyway someone gave an iranian a UNK of four rangers tickets last year	6 7 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 4
i think that not only UNK inside the public school system but in society itself	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 2 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 6 2 4 4
well so am i	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
it was it was really amazing	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4
the united states UNK UNK with patriot missiles	2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and there there so many different problems there	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 6	6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because	6 3 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
laughter-that laughter-that a whole different sport	3 1 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 4 6
unfair or something	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
um he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
when you do that then it becomes almost uh	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
i think that that one of the things too	3 6 3 1 7 2 4 4 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4
do you want to start	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4
you know there there the classic sort of to kill a UNK kind of story where you get you know jury which	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 3 7 6 7 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
my dad could eat a a	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
so it may be may be a good UNK	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
might not go if it was voluntary	6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
what did you what kind of things did you do	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
that um	6 6	6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
that real good	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh they will	6 3 6	6 3 6
i that that about how much i can cook	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4
by uh	6 6	6 6
has a UNK and a visa card	6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 6 6
and i heard that there there uh	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
that that what i one thing i like about ti ti is that they are are overly strict about what you wear	3 1 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
uh brought up for jury duty	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
not very high	6 6 6	6 4 4
in appeals court just because of UNK	6 2 4 6 6 6 7	3 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh um	6 6	6 6
fortunately in his case the death penalty was UNK	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
but because i sort of stick to several schools	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and it would put a you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 2	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4 6 2 4
ways can encourage	7 5 5	6 6 4
or um	6 6	6 6
they came out with a european UNK	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely	7 5 5 5 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
well i had that	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
there there a certain amount of UNK meals you have to have	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 2 4
and it it not UNK people	6 3 1 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6
well i mean he he doing all right probably	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
UNK that you know kind of	2 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
but in urban areas it it laughter-you laughter-know	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
i mean	6 6	6 6
i think youd youd be more willing to either help that person or help it	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4
i just	3 6	6 6
and we hope so	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
that that a lot	3 1 7 5	3 1 6 6
there are times when you ca ca avoid all that	6 6 7 5 3 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4
i use to think that you know after you worth	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
sure it is	6 6 6	6 6 6
close by	6 6	6 6
we do do have a lot of that	3 6 6 6 7 5 2 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
we uh	6 6	6 6
so im im im im an avid aerobics	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4	6 6 6 7 1 2 4 4
it frustrates me sometime not being able to have a dog	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
oh well	6 6	6 6
dollars spent for this that or the other	2 4 4 3 1 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
soon after i had done that once	6 6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 3 6 6 4 4
the society where where we have so much more UNK	2 4 4 4 3 2 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
there there been and extraordinary amount of	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 4
i was the UNK	3 6 7 5	3 6 2 4
what kind of cloth uses that	2 4 4 4 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6
decisions that i just ca ca go along with	2 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh i felt sorry for them1	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
what what gonna gonna happen	7 5 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6
it it very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 7 5 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
weve weve had several here lately	3 1 6 7 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
im im doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before i do	3 1 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 6 4 4 6 6
and that in turn like you know	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and have seen the error of their ways	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 2 4
so there must be something to some of them	6 6 6 6 3 6 7 2 3	6 3 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
you know i would love to to be able to read more because i i enjoy it so much	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 4
is that i think that	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
now i	6 6	6 6
therere therere so many games in in a year that theyve theyve got to have repeat customers	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 4
im im not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years	3 1 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 4
let me tell you	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 3
complete dark all day long	6 6 7 5 6	2 4 6 6 6
the day if youre youre just kind of UNK and do do go down the back streets or alleys and	2 4 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 2 6	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6

there there a lot of you know	6 6 7 5 2 6 2	3 1 6 4 4 6 3
and um	6 6	6 6
and uh they had this bill	6 6 3 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
is that right	6 3 6	6 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
they kind of say well what do you want me to believe	3 6 6 6 6 7 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
the um the	6 6 6	6 6 6
steve steve steve has a sister who has four	6 6 2 6 7 5 3 7 2	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
bringing the little kitten over to uh to my folks	6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
there was a	6 6 2	6 6 6
to determine exactly what the what the things are	2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
it it got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of UNK	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 3	3 1 6 6 6 4 4 2 4 6 3 1 6 4 6 3
uh it used to be so- so	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
if policy is established	6 7 6 6	2 6 6 4
i have uh very little regard for the law	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 6 2 4
views are are just kind of become a thing of the past	7 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4
sounds wonderful	6 6	6 6
a fine profession fine field to go into	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
well you ca ca afford to	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
that that of course that is certainly true	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 1 6 4 6 3 4 4
in high school were kind of lazy and all	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
do do	6 6	3 1
he he not that far	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
if if	6 6	6 6
in a lot of big cities	6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4
he hooked it up right	3 6 3 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
well that that neat	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6

um up north like you said	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
nice speaking to you	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
the economy itself around here is not	3 1 1 1 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 6 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
i have to call and get it fixed	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 3 6 3 6 6 4
with them	6 3	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
to the super bowl	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
put it on your UNK now	6 3 6 2 4 6	3 6 3 6 6 6
UNK this animal	6 3 1	6 6 6
and the state still ca ca bring itself to	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
that type not much home break-ins break-ins	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff	7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4
simply because	6 6	6 4
um what do you want to concentrate on	6 7 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6
i do do i do do really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 4 4 4 6

i have a nephew	3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
one one bad enough	2 4 6 6	3 1 6 6
johnson city	3 1	6 6
and you can go the opposite direction	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
not having a complete turnover every some small number of years	7 5 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
but theyll theyll let you look down the UNK	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it sure is	6 6 6	6 6 6
major cause it seems up here is UNK	3 1 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6
to me	6 3	6 6
not always	6 6	6 6
and i think uh	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
well at least ive ive heard that	6 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 2 6 3 1 6 6
if they go to	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
and from talking to them theyre theyre shocked	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
i mean i think UNK UNK was in it too another one that if you UNK youd youd miss her	6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6
and you begin to wonder	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
well it was a political move	6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 2 4 4
that has had no training whatsoever	3 7 5 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 4 4
and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 6 3 2 3	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4
and yet he bought like seventeen UNK	6 6 3 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
there there a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is uh	6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 7 5 5 5 6 2 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4
so uh it was one of those things where	6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and uh so i guess it these plants they just they do do	6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
that that what i need	3 1 1 1 6	3 1 6 6 6
and that that the thing yeah	6 3 1 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
well i guarantee you youd youd be paying a lot more in taxes if- if uh the democrats had	6 3 6 3 1 1 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 3
you still have a view that the american voter is different from other voters	3 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 7 5 5 2 4	2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 6 4 4
i guess that that an invasion of privacy	3 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	3 6 3 1 7 4 4 4
nothing will occur i guess without a crisis	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they say will fit it	3 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6
and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 3 2 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4
and so i think he got a real good deal	6 6 3 6 3 6 3 1 1 1	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so you really not making a UNK profit	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
ill bet you it is a dutch iris	3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
well i can see why if youve youve got little ones just coming along	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
how about	6 6	3 6
it it still in UNK	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 2 4
dad had UNK and	2 6 7 6	6 6 4 6
into some sort of a	6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
that- that sounds a lot like a walt disney film	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4
i mean when you described it	3 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 4
theyre theyre actually a necessity in life	2 4 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 2 4 6 4
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
innocent until proven guilty	7 5 5 5	6 6 4 4
and he keeps saying oh no	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i mean hell hell do a little UNK things	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
but uh you know fortunately for him he was was dumb	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6
particularly what kind of music do you like	6 7 5 2 4 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
is to	6 6	6 6
you know being a non	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
so do you have a car	6 6 3 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 6 6
come from um like georgia or	2 4 4 4 4 4	6 4 4 6 4 4
he he a writer	3 1 7 5	3 1 2 4
well theyve theyve	6 3 1	6 6 6
like you said if you had four kids	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4
and it it you know it it killed several people	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her	6 7 5 3 7 5 5 2 4 7 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 6
you know	6 6	6 6
something like a uh state auditor	3 2 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4
really there could be um	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and then all of a sudden something happens	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
been able to get some good players and come around	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
but theyre theyre not speaking for me	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i mean i went in the service when i was eighteen	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 7	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4
we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just ca ca compare	3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 7 5 5 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
and one of the ones that had an impact was	6 7 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
well the thing of it is the the that- that- that that is uh	6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 6
use that	6 3	6 6
okay i-	6 6	6 6
you know walk with- you know walk with you know with	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
corpus christi texas which has the	2 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
i i do do know	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
huh that that interesting	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
you know	6 6	6 6
more money to these people	2 4 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
and it and it seems if youre youre going to have kids uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4
just like now you know there there	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but just because of a job opportunity	6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and then selling it	2 4 4 3	6 6 6 3
i i um clean houses part-time	6 3 6 6 7 6	2 4 4 4 4 4
type program that it it it would catch a lot of things	2 4 3 6 6 3 2 4 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4
this being that different	3 6 6 6	6 6 4 4
and then they want	6 6 3 6	6 6 2 4
it it really uh	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 5 2 4 3 1 1 1 1	6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4
that that huge	3 1 6	3 1 6
we have two chows and	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
were were a big hockey area up here	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6	3 1 6 2 4 6 6 6
support because you know it was	2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 2 4
well you can see it in the work place	6 3 6 6 3 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6
but it it nice having a dog here uh	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
when there there	6 6 6	6 6 6
i mean you UNK	6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
he was a UNK	3 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
um vice	7 2	6 6
now i have quite a few credit cards that im im always almost up to the limit on most of them1	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 2 3	6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4
but one one thing that i	6 6 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6
been involved	6 6	6 6
fun they had with these computer games	7 2 6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
its its there is good reason to do it	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
ive ive never heard anything about this before	3 1 6 6 3 7 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
to come in and live with them1	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and i need it for the break	6 3 6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 3 6 2 4
every now and then one is tempted to feel that way	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
is UNK	6 6	6 6
the average classes really	3 1 1 6	2 4 4 4
oh okay	6 6	6 6
in it	6 3	6 6
they ca ca imagine for anything else	6 6 6 6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know i do do i think it was uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
really you know	2 6 2	6 6 6
i pay	3 6	6 6
how come uh you do do have any now	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and theyll theyll theyll theyll call you back	6 6 6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
uh particularly for uh	6 6 6 6	6 4 4 4
i do do	6 6 6	6 6 6
but if youre youre in the corporate world i think there is UNK motivation for	6 6 3 1 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4
she looked UNK	3 6 6	3 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
a total UNK	2 4 4	3 4 6
if theyd theyd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me	6 3 1 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
time you know that- that okay this is the way	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
problems they had in the past	2 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 1 6
shed shed lay on her step	3 1 6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
and i guess it has a UNK	6 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
it it a hassle	3 1 7 5	6 6 6 1
well the other side is that unfortunately	6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4
see the movies lately	6 2 4 6	6 2 4 4
the rain forest and all	2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
dry but pretty even climate was was it	2 4 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
that one one just more for looks you know	3 1 1 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
weve weve got	3 1 6	3 1 6
somewhat that	6 3	6 6
the criminals that are going to get their guns	7 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
they tell me	3 6 3	3 6 6
and that that not	6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6
he knew it	3 6 3	6 6 6
i am from kentucky	3 6 6 2	6 6 6 6
um for UNK reasons not for preference	6 6 7 5 6 6 7	6 6 4 6 6 2 4
store you know	2 6 6	6 2 4
you know special corps of	6 7 2 4 4	6 2 4 6 6
and there there a power structure that you have UNK to	6 6 6 7 5 5 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 4
well wonder if that	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
i mean i feel like if	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
that that true	3 1 6	3 1 6
most of my friends	7 2 4 4	6 3 1 6
and um	6 6	6 6
over in ti ti mean for ti ti but over in italy	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
whatever work	2 4	6 6
we went in together and hired a private instructor	2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4
well you know there there a lot of companies that wo wo give UNK women maternity leave	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 5 5 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4
or have more to do	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
and that that where i get get into the problem with with him	6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
had this you know pretty much UNK UNK of guns going for so long	6 7 6 7 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
my wife and i both work	2 4 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4
it it was really great	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
whatever kind of community or public service might be available	7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6 6
take care	6 6	6 6
i guess it it just that maybe people are	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 6 6 1 6 6 6 4 6
i- i really i- i think that that that the whole key here	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 7 5 5 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
you have some savings in terms of UNK money keeping people in jail or not	3 6 7 5 6 7 5 5 5 6 2 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
anything at all	3 6 6	6 6 6
it was	3 6	6 6
we need the one extra room	3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh medication for a uh	6 7 6 6 6	6 6 4 4 6
well what- what what the difference there	6 6 7 5 2 4 6	6 6 3 1 2 4 6
because1 a lot of them1 lived in like a group you know down one highway	6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
and everywhere else	2 4 4	6 6 6
you did laughter-what you wanted to do	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
i would would want to go by myself	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
there there not enough room to plant	6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 4 4
UNK off every single one of the perks	6 6 7 5 5 2 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and ive	6 3	6 6
well that that nice	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
UNK the head	6 2 4	6 6 4
well that that a neat idea	6 3 1 7 5 5	3 6 6 6 6 6
and then i had to wheel UNK it in	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
with uh hair UNK or those those-	6 6 7 5 5 5 5	2 6 4 4 6 6 6
the company doing drugs	3 1 2 4	6 6 4 4
they they think they	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
if your your UNK it in terms of information gone even if it it something you do do know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded	6 3 1 6 3 6 7 2 3 2 6 6 3 1 1 1 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 4 4
they have uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
i do do like that when they start	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
so she had to go	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
the death penalty is not given often	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
she does does have a brown nose	3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 2 4 6
and i think with uh	6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i most of my friends have three or four kids	6 7 3 1 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4
but i there there i think there there ways around it though that you know	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
and uh and the point of of i guess	6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
your UNK	2 4	6 4
i know it is	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
but UNK can be	6 2 6 6	6 6 6 6
but i	6 3	6 6
i remember when they were coming home	3 6 6 2 6 6 6	2 4 6 6 6 6 6
i ended up going into UNK you know	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i am single and female	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4
UNK i mean not UNK carrots	2 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 4
do an absolutely necessary job	6 7 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
well what about random testing though	6 7 6 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
budget this year	7 2 4	6 6 6
but um what i found out	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6
weve weve only been here in texas for about a year	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
how about how about the reverse of that	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
i mean a shotgun just just struck me as being you know a real good UNK weapon	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
but texas is	6 2 4	6 6 6
uh im im going to start this summer	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
we lost lives	3 6 2	6 6 6
ive ive never heard of it before	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
so i tried to have a goldfish	6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
well how about having a jury- jury and a judge work together on it somehow	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4
theyd theyd be able to say im im sorry	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 4 3 1 6
in america if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 2 4
but still i have some that are	6 6 3 6 7 3 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre like you say theyre theyre not the most exciting pet	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6
it it just like the uh the social security system	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
when theyre theyre ten they have to live in it	6 3 1 7 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and they and they mentioned that one	6 6 6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 2 4 6 6
i ca ca remember	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3	6 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
and we were asleep	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
UNK instead have- have them pick up around the school yard have them	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 3 6 6 6 4
anything can be obtained from anybody anybody	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4 6 2 4
i- i was trying to remember	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
every road sign you come to is like well i did did know i that far	2 4 4 3 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i do do know if i know anything or not	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i and i believe that	6 6 3 6 3	6 6 3 6 6
and there there a big difference	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4
this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country	6 6 6 3 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
right about the same time or after	2 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
on the whole im im pleased when i	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 2 4 6 1 6 6 6
and im im im im going off	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
and wall hangings	2 4 4	6 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
one thing or the other	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
ca ca hardly talk	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
how how can it work	6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6
i did	3 6	3 6
it it the whole city	6 6 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6
you uh have to learn	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
but uh the russian economy	6 6 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
that theyre theyre really neat	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
was tried and convicted and sentenced to death	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6
but there there always a sell	6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 2 4
to get that judge UNK i would think	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
takes awhile to to get used to something	6 7 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 4 6 6 4 4 4 4
and he knows he should	6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 2 6
that might be kind of tough huh	3 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 4 4 6
i our- our company company doing it	6 6 3 1 1 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
uh north carolina state	6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6
and he says he he so interesting mom	6 3 6 3 1 6 6 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
it it	6 6	6 1
were were so i would	6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6
um let let see	6 6 6 6	6 2 4 6
uh ford t bird	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
you know i want to feel like i at least tried	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
simple as that	6 6 3	6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
it was kind of slow	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 4
and um	6 6	6 6
neighborhoods i mean theyll theyll	2 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
UNK type thing	7 5 5	6 6 6
and i i think that we learned from that	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
you know this rat is acting really strange	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 6
based on	6 6	6 6
theyre theyre in there for a purpose	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
i mean it is so far down the road	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
it really would	3 6 6	6 6 6
how did you know to choose this subject tonight	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4

the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school	7 5 6 6 7 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 6 2 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 4

recently with the	6 6 6	6 6 4
i i i hate	6 6 3 6	6 6 4 4
and theyre theyre not	6 3 1 6	6 6 1 6
i do do know how to make it better for them	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
but um	6 6	6 6
or a fifth of	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6
stupid guys	2 4	6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh it was in march of last year	6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 4
would you have to give them	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 3 6 6
uh having the car checked out	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6
i i heard something on the news the other night	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and we had a female mayor here in dallas	6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
the more people are aware of it the the more theyll theyll do	6 6 2 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
uh well drug and alcohol testing program	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
there is is any way to get paid enough	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
and then the UNK even took it back from the germans and never bothered to give it back you know	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 6 6
it it a UNK	6 6 2 4	3 1 2 1
there are people now	6 6 2 6	6 6 6 6
threat to life and UNK	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
does does seem like it it being	6 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
we had to call the insurance company	3 6 6 6 7 5 5	3 6 3 6 2 4 4
cocoa did did think too much of it though	3 6 6 6 7 5 6 3 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
of the UNK	2 4 4	6 3 4
they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
that that	2 4	6 1
far as you know crime in the cities im im sure	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 3 1 6
and it kind of has to start from the top	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
because it it a situation	6 3 1 7 5	6 3 1 2 4
i remember i had a college professor who once said that	3 6 3 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 6 6
back east from	2 4 4	6 6 6
i know they automatically	3 6 3 6	3 6 6 6
but i could see getting one from birth and everything	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
im im glad that theyre theyre staying in arlington	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 3	3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 4
and i have a feeling that the persian gulf	6 3 6 7 5 5 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
it it not	3 1 6	3 1 6
or they used	6 3 6	6 6 6
man our UNK our uh prisons are so crowded	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
well like i told you before	6 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 3 6 2 4
and uh	6 6	6 6
that that UNK interesting concept	3 1 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6
and bye	6 6	6 6
to meet these people	6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6
i understand this	3 6 3	6 6 6
whenever our five minutes up	6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6
uh industries well the transportation industry for UNK uh you know specifically	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 2 4	2 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 4
that that so stupid that you all have two teams	3 1 6 6 6 3 7 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
and the skunk would be sitting at her feet	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
because of therere so many cars	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 4
use an extra one for an office	6 2 4 4 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
so if youre youre a nincompoop on trial youd youd youd youd have to have UNK to uh	6 6 3 1 7 5 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
oh id id hate to be there during UNK UNK	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
and ive ive had two UNK UNK	6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 4 4
but other states you have to register every couple of years and uh	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 6
bridge the gap	2 4 4	6 2 4
i had	3 6	6 6
um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
well that that interesting is is it	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
UNK shell shell buy a lot of UNK yeah shell shell buy a lot clothes	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 3 1 6
did you see UNK heights	6 3 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6
and at that point you know i- i really think	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
you know you just ca ca do that	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
UNK us in the long run hopefully	6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4 4
this needs to be done	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
well that that UNK by	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
um my sister-in-law now lives in um	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 2 4 6 6 6 6
and i	6 3	6 6
um it seems like there was	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
id id like to	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
well the early ones	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
my gosh	6 6	6 6
you know that that that what all these these UNK are about	6 6 6 3 1 1 7 5 5 5 6 6	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
twelve miles or so from the	7 5 5 5 6 2	6 6 6 6 4 4
this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing	7 5 5 6 6 3 7 5 6 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 6 6
i- i	6 3	6 6
but oh gosh i ca ca even walk by central park	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
now if i wanted to	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
so i do do have as much time	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
i do do understand the	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i do do know which that answer is	3 6 6 6 3 7 5 6	6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4
i probably wo wo finish it until the end of the year	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that is hard	3 6 6	6 6 6
they just say do you believe in such and such	3 6 6 6 2 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
we both think of that that as just so important to get him involved in stuff like that	3 7 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4
but um i know that people used to UNK their whole schedules around those you know	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
so i made a copy of the check that they had UNK	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
not- nobody does	6 3 6	6 6 6
worry about it	2 4 3	6 6 3
but um	6 6	6 6
but i also love sports	6 3 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 4
i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code	3 6 6 2 4 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 6 4 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 4 4
but what they do is UNK um homeless i think mostly men but homeless people	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4
automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job	2 4 7 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4
they can they can actually they can pump water	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
and you know it it	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
how how much you stuff in your brain	6 2 4 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
but uh	6 6	6 6
seven months old got a UNK UNK and	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6
but uh the miniskirt miniskirt many times will UNK comments you do do really want	6 6 2 4 4 7 5 6 6 7 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6
one of the reasons that im im against it is that uh um im im afraid of	7 5 5 5 5 3 1 7 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 3 1 6 6
so youre youre probably uh	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
so i mean that that the way we will be going	6 6 6 3 1 2 4 3 2 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 6 4
but to keep the guy that that illegal from getting his hands on one	6 6 6 2 4 3 1 2 6 6 2 4 6 2	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i had one call from- actually from charlotte north carolina	3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
uh to give you an example my mom had an elderly cat who uh	6 6 6 3 7 5 2 4 6 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
have you read the silence of the lambs	6 3 6 6 6 2 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 2 4
well we retired early	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
and you do do ever touch it unless im im here	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6
no matter how much the	6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
it it it it something that you can really talk about	6 6 3 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
when um	6 6	6 6
you can do much better	3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
out of it	6 6 3	6 6 6
i uh	6 6	6 6
the fact that	7 5 5	3 6 6
heinous crimes	2 4	6 6
and they were talking about selling the UNK UNK UNK lists	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
so i do do	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
recycling campaigns that	2 4 3	6 6 6
uh north carolina is all the way on the east coast	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and then you have to pay them some kind of a UNK	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and training is different than anything else	6 3 6 6 6 3 2	2 4 6 6 6 6 6
things will pick up	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
well speaking of pets ill ill tell you my my kids are older now my both of them1 are either in or out of college	6 6 6 3 1 1 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 6 2 4
i guess last year when i went back to work i had	3 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and he he	6 3 1	6 6 6
the cream of the UNK i guess you could say	7 5 5 5 5 3 7 3 7 5	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
and yeah	6 6	6 6
and and	6 6	6 6
uh the epa epa epa	6 3 1 1 1	6 6 4 4 4
i know it it you know worse in the larger cities	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
they for them to realize that	3 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
or else they would have said something	6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
your health consciousness	2 4 4	6 6 4
it it just	6 6 6	3 1 6
i mean i guess we everybody everybody responsible for the society	3 6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
then other people will wait up you know and	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
is what we are UNK is	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
but it is a very nice nursing home	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4 4 6
it all came down they just	6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
uh but maybe UNK	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
do you want to talk	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
that that where	3 1 6	3 1 6
so they work on that job	6 3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 4
id id say right around six maybe seven years	3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
anything like	3 2	6 6
i ca ca remember	3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6
but everybody that was real close to the water ended up	6 3 1 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6
it it going back towards	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i have a similar problem	3 6 2 4 4	3 6 2 4 6
laughter-right i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 2	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
i think that that unbelievable	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 3 1 6
and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
so well this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day	6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4 6
i live near a UNK	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 2 4
and it	6 6	6 6
and that that really helped a lot	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
so it it really building up	6 3 1 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6
i know	3 6	6 6
i think it it uh	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 1 6
woman woman job or a man man job but	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
im im	3 1	3 1
or sixty	2 4	3 6
for ozone and oh yeah all that	6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 4 6 6 6 6 6

and i bought a pistol there	6 3 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
i think that that already on most of them1	3 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3
how funny	6 6	6 4
uh shoot	6 6	6 6
im im	6 6	3 1
in in dealing with a large company	2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
my dad dad got a new um	2 4 4 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 3
so i mean his appeal was denied	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
and i	6 6	6 6
but there there kind of like a little	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
and in that country it it a duty to pay taxes	6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4 6 4 4
it it more of	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
you know weve weve got	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
now we got	6 7 6	6 6 6
converted it to metric just about as easy	6 2 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i thought for sure id id been raised properly	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6
that that kind of like	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
let let see	6 6 6	3 1 6
ive ive done it maybe twelve times	3 1 6 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 2 4 4 4
im im im im thinking of actually moving to australia	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 2 6 4 6 4
look at the cowboys now	6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 4 6
you know UNK	6 6 6	6 6 6
i mean they have have the all they have are UNK uh mesquite	6 6 6 6 6 6 7 3 2 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
a lot to be made though	7 5 2 4 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
so you know yeah	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and the other is two and a half	6 2 4 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
it was after	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and it stopped raining almost twenty hours ago	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
oh so	6 6	6 6
than ive ive ever been	6 3 1 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
i do	3 6	6 6
i used to work for a textbook UNK	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
so i thought man i do do know if i trust this or not	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6 6
but it it	6 6 6	6 6 6
you know what i mean	6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 5
if if if youve youve ever seen the program paper UNK	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 3 6 1 6 6 2 4 4 4
turn at the end when you found out who it was	7 5 2 4 6 3 6 6 3 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4
had lived in for sometime	7 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 2 4
and sometimes ill ill do that	6 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 3 1 6 6
that helps out	3 6 6	6 6 6
aids has more money than uh breast cancer	3 6 2 4 4 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
i do	3 6	3 6
it was just a wonderful car	3 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4
the motivational factor is probably	3 1 1 6 6	3 4 6 6 6
they they do	6 3 6	6 6 6
oh wow	6 6	6 4
because that that what the experience they want	7 3 1 7 2 4 3 2	6 3 1 6 7 4 4 4
and uh i think were were seeing a lot of	6 6 3 6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
i would would know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
it it just such a huge expense	3 1 6 7 5 5 5	3 1 6 6 2 4 4
but the texas soil	6 2 4 4	6 2 4 4
you are you are right there	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6
and all that stuff loads the	6 2 4 4 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 3
it it real pretty	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
with somebody youd youd probably have to go to out eat or something	2 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
you have two	3 6 3	3 6 6
i just	3 6	3 6
and that that been real good	6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
in one half of the house	2 7 5 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 2 4
and i appreciate the conversation	6 3 6 7 5	6 3 6 2 4
that that you did that that what you did	6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4 4
ive ive ive ive seen those	6 6 3 1 6 7	6 6 3 1 6 6
probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 4
starting some sort of a military elitist type	6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
about four credit cards this year	7 5 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4
is it	6 6	6 6
it it really silly that i enjoy him a lot	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
he was a good construction uh you know UNK instructor pilot because he considered himself UNK	3 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4
well let me ask you about this	6 6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
you know there there no reason to suspect someone you know	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 4 6 3
finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh	6 6 3 2 3 1 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6 4 4 4
that their their going to have to do what someone else says even though they did did vote for it	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
you know and they flipping me the finger and all that	6 6 6 3 6 3 2 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 6 6
but ive ive never actually been there	6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
you know kind of UNK off what	6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
theyre theyre	3 1	6 1
that could be a complicated too could could it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
you know the lower level courses i sometimes wondered you know	6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
laughter-but that does not sit very well with a lot of folks im im sure	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6
and some of the	6 7 2 4	3 6 6 6
up here we have uh we have quite a few	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
i had one kid threaten my life	3 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i think they only have four boys	3 6 3 6 6 2 4	3 6 3 6 6 6 6
you get the impression that	3 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
parks and UNK building	7 5 5 5	6 6 6 4
it it not theyre theyre not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4 4 6 4
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place	7 5 5 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4
oh there there one in salem	6 6 6 7 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 4
a a potential	6 6 6	3 1 6
it has to be even uh	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4
so were were watching the game	6 2 4 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6
oh no	6 6	6 6
san juan UNK UNK	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
i do do think she checks things out very well	3 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
they set up	3 6 6	6 6 6
our cats are indoor cats	2 4 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 6
you wo wo even notice it though	3 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
i can- i can relate to it i UNK	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4
i started to say the UNK	3 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 2 4
and they do do wanna wanna think about it	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and one on the way	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
and it it kind of	6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
uh at the UNK UNK UNK UNK air force base up here	6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 6 6
and then taking	6 6 6	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
um there there	6 6 6	6 6 6
it hurts your UNK to hear it	6 6 2 4 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 3
and i would limit it strictly to something like	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6
here in in dennison	6 3 1 6	6 2 4 6
illinois at one time	2 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
well why stop at children	6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and i do do have a problem at all with employers	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 2	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4
a gun that is not registered or	2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
did you did you UNK your daughter to her before you made your decision	6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 3 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think there there been like six or seven of them1 over the last like probably eight	3 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 3 6 2 4 4 2 4 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 3
booked up	6 6	6 6
of the UNK employee is is hurting the business	2 4 4 4 7 5 5 2 4	6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
it was	3 6	6 6
like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6
except that i do do trust the people who are UNK to vote	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
or do you do you get into that that	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
because1 i have a stepson now who who twenty	6 3 6 2 4 6 3 1 7	6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in	6 3 6 6 6 3 2 4 3 2 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 6
like um	6 6	6 6
well see	6 6	3 6
because1 if that that what if that that what the punishment is	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 2 4 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4
almost knocked me down	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
but if i had a third one	6 6 3 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6
i know	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
i tend to agree with you david	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
you know until the last- past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4
oh i see	6 3 6	6 6 6
that that what im im thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own youll youll laughter-understand	3 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 4 3 1 1	3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 3 1 6
competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
i could have gone monday	3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
and they go home	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
areas in which ti ti stands to to gain some some short term business to UNK that	7 5 3 1 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6
it it just me and my sister	6 6 6 3 2 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i do do believe that	3 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
and there there there there a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 3 1	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
you know get laid off or something	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4 4
what what that	7 5 3	3 1 6
texas tends to be a little more UNK and UNK	3 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
but if no one does anything when theyre theyre little	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 1 6
it it one thing	3 1 2 4	3 1 6 6
i do do think they can they can	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
maybe maybe being a UNK professor would be one thing	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4 4
and and	6 6	6 6
and uh loved that thing	6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6
your friend friend not going to have a chance	3 1 1 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4

i id id like to see something like that	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 6
one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble	7 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 7 5 5 5 6 6 7	6 6 2 4 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
i guess the guy that that on	3 6 2 4 3 1 2	3 6 3 6 6 4 6
a uh no good rotten drunk	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
oh man	6 6	6 6
really fast if they already know what youre youre talking about	6 6 6 3 6 6 3 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 4 6
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you run obviously	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 2 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i think so too	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
you know where you get around the edge	6 7 5 3 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
that that laughter-that laughter-that absolutely right	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
that would that would be much	6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
so i go outside the area for that	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
well the the the	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 3
well the question is you know do you think	6 7 5 6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
is that	6 6	6 6
that- we we do do have um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 1 6 6
do you uh	6 3 6	6 3 6
and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus	6 2 4 3 2 4 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4
this is is a problem that we have	3 6 6 2 4 3 1 2	6 6 6 2 5 6 6 4
they took us around on a UNK you know	3 6 2 6 6 7 5 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
then we	6 3	6 6
im im trying to think of	3 1 6 6 6 6	6 1 6 3 1 6
and they never	6 2 6	6 6 6
and some people do do vote	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
well you know what i was hoping	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
ive ive heard	3 1 6	3 1 6
so i do do get any overtime or anything like that	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 2 3	6 3 6 1 6 6 4 6 4 4 4
uh back when i had my business i got one	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 7	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
im im in the air force	3 1 6 3 1 1	3 1 6 6 6 6
and it it not as boring if you get several people	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 4 4
and i might see it on a you know a	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
issue is the	7 6 6	6 6 6
i mean i do think that	6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
threat anymore as a	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
and im im like baloney	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
the same person every day	2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6
but certain religious groups	6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6
the um	6 6	6 6
no idea-	6 6	6 6
somebody get UNK of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they laughter-did laughter-you laughter-know	3 6 7 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 7 5 3 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i really could could	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
hey thanks a lot	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
you you	6 6	6 6
in the bible it says uh	6 2 4 6 6 6	6 2 6 6 6 6
i should say one arm giving another	3 6 6 2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
type thing	6 6	6 6
every once in a while	6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 4
and uh but uh now im im on the UNK UNK on the other foot	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 4 6 6 2 4
when youve youve got that type of attitude on the people do do care about their work	6 3 1 6 2 4 3 2 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 6 4
we do	7 6	3 6
because as i say there is a there there a UNK	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do think it it been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 4 4
and so	6 6	6 6
and it may be friday for the senior high schools	6 6 6 6 2 6 2 4 4 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
let let see	3 1 6	3 1 6
on my car	2 3 1	6 6 6
may or april	2 7 2	6 6 6
decide you know which kind of uh	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
i was was buying you know just to hold onto it	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 6
well that that great	6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6
and it seems to me that it it it it not a totally bad idea	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
perfect boxes to put UNK in	2 4 4 4 7 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
you know i do do know for if youre youre familiar with that or not	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
that that funny	3 1 6	3 1 6
and and also um	6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6
and he did what what he said	6 3 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4
i loved that film	3 6 3 1	2 6 6 6
i have	3 6	6 6
it it easy to	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
you know once they they have been arrested	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
there was one year when my father was uh	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
they do do always work	3 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
as a matter of fact in texas um	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 4
so i never	6 6 6	6 6 6
i guess just like other companies other friends ive ive been hearing about that have been moving around	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 1 2 4 4 3 2 4 4 4	2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 6 2 4 4 4
that is one solution to it	3 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
things like i had the flu last week	2 4 3 2 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
is it	6 3	6 6
and when they do put them1 in there you know	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
which uh	2 4	6 6
in you know	6 6 6	6 6 6
show some sort of violence to settle the	7 5 5 2 4 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and he counted the fish	6 3 6 3 1	6 3 6 2 4
but there are an awful lot of young people who would	6 6 6 7 5 5 2 4 4 3 2	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
that that the hard part is cooking with uh kids around because uh	3 1 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4 4
UNK just severely limited the campaigns so money was was so much of an issue	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
our uh	6 6	6 6
in a way it is	6 7 5 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
um the players that are	6 2 4 4 4	6 2 4 6 6
and uh this was during a holdup of a uh	6 6 3 6 6 7 5 5 5 5	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
because1 when youre youre UNK you probably do do want to take the time to	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 4 6
except our outside	6 6 6	6 3 6
and it UNK twenty pounds or something like that	6 3 6 2 4 4 3 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3
real poor	6 6	6 6
my best friends are lawyers	2 4 4 6 2	6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and the one that that accused was the one that actually did it	6 2 4 3 1 2 6 2 4 3 2 4 3	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
uh her	6 3	3 1
and uh	6 6	6 6
have anybody that UNK that i laughter-vote laughter-for	6 3 1 2 3 1 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
social changes	2 4	6 4
you know where they could go from there	6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6
um well ive ive been to	6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6
ive ive never done potato	3 1 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you UNK the uh the norms of social- of um public behavior	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
what do you think about capital punishment	7 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
and i was looking at	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
so let let talk about	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
it it uh	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh i do do know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
i like uh	3 6 6	6 6 6
you can only laugh	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
intelligent UNK	7 5	6 4
and that that got me very	6 3 1 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i do too	3 6 6	3 6 6
the whole way	2 4 4	6 6 6
that it has some influence on it	6 3 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 3
well um	6 6	6 6
on the south side of our of our house we planted some UNK	6 2 4 4 4 4 4 3 1 1 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
we used to try to get together	2 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 3 6 6 6 6
you call up their regular	3 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6
they do have too much control over us already	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
percent of the house	7 2 3 1	6 3 1 6
UNK believe in that	6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6
in fact id id like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 4 4
and theyre theyre	6 6 6	6 6 6
go on to some new technology	7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 4
and they work less	6 3 6 6	3 6 6 6
oh yes	6 6	6 6
people suing people over	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
oh my god the poor woman	6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6
i i think some of the dress codes are different	6 3 6 7 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
and you	6 6	6 6
quarterback in the	2 4 4	6 6 6
but it it always well	6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
and they were playing in the back yard	6 2 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
is it	6 3	6 6
so that uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
and then	6 6	6 6
was uh UNK	6 6 6	2 4 4
we were laughing i mean	2 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
who who in your family	3 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 4 4
now this needs to be UNK this is the time this needs to be done	6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt	7 5 5 5 3 1 6 2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4
and i hope maybe were were going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 6 3 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 6
but if you can find a centrally located place	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
they do do she does does shop at foley foley you know and stuff like that	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 3 2 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 4 6 6 2 4 6 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
which is not very many	3 2 4 7 5	6 6 6 6 6
but how how often do you do that	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
they come in all different colors	3 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 6
well preceding criminal record UNK to the judicial process	6 3 1 1 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 4 4 4 4 2 4 4
i know	3 6	6 6
so i said well i think ill ill go back to school and	6 3 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
worth our while to	6 2 4 6	6 2 6 6
you are	6 6	6 6
they just	6 6	6 6
things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way	2 3 1 7 5 6 6 2 4 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 6
there there only an hour less than that between the two	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 3 1	3 1 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6 6
there there all sorts of systems where suicide	6 6 7 5 2 4 4 7	3 1 7 5 2 4 4 4
i felt that this was a company that should have been more UNK	3 6 6 3 6 2 4 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4 4
i guess one of the differences i see is uh	3 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 6 6
i believe it was one of these um one of these um UNK these like these juice machines	3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 4 4

countries in the world and their educational problems	2 4 4 4 7 2 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves	7 5 2 4 7 2 7 5 5 5 5 6 7 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think that we are going to be	3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6

uh one of the radio stations over here	6 7 2 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6

small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves	7 5 5 3 1 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
it was like oh that could be it	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well i i sometimes wonder if i did did mess up	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4 6 3 4 4 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
weve weve been doing a lot of UNK	3 1 6 6 7 5 2 4	3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4
yeah- well you you know youre youre talking to part of them that that paying for that	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 2 4 3 1 2 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6
oh my my husband husband always wanted a chow	6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 4
it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4
and ive ive been watching uh	6 3 1 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
and and this and this article said that theyve theyve got a real problem that	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6
you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 7 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 4
UNK an hour	6 3 1	6 6 6
that that exactly right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
the the real nice one	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 6
that unions are outdated	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 4
cases of you know	2 4 6 2	6 6 6 6
and and i do do know if it it uh the	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 7 4 4 6
and she she really really doing good and learning a lot	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
that that the last thing you want to do	3 1 7 5 5 3 7 5 5	3 1 2 4 4 3 4 4 4
the tighter you UNK the more the price goes up the more incentive there is	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 4 6 4
oh i agree with you	6 3 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6
a miniature schnauzer	2 4 4	6 6 6
if you UNK that	6 3 6 6	6 2 4 6
well you know it it cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that are all ready	6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well like i was saying burlington burlington crime	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 3 6 6 2 4 4
uh james UNK	6 7 5	6 4 6
listens to their vote	6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
i think the UNK rule is yeah expect it	3 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 3	3 6 2 4 6 4 4 4 4
certainly certainly not a dog	6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 4
and that we should support each other	6 6 3 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
they talk about women	3 6 6 2	3 6 6 6
and you know the cop cop just got to go back and	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
but on the other hand there there a lot of advantages to it	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 3
but i really do enjoy-	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
i have wondered why	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
there there some	6 6 2	3 1 6
we do do want you to go through the work and then find out that	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
once or twice a year	6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6
uh you know a non a non	6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that they quite literally	6 3 6 6	6 6 4 6
and um	6 6	6 6
that that great	3 1 6	3 1 6
uh definitely	6 6	6 4
they kept boring that block out to where	2 6 6 2 4 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
UNK i guess that would be a good idea	6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
do not deny yourself the new york experience- but experience but go with people that you know	6 6 6 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 2 3 1 2	3 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
she she	6 6	6 1
and i never felt	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
there there nothing wrong with that	6 6 3 2 4 3	3 1 6 6 2 6
you know they lost their job	6 6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4
but im im kind of concerned about um with having cats	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
i do know there there a lot of companies that are very	3 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4 3 2 4	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
that i UNK i was going to finish for somebody for UNK	3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
no doubt	7 5	6 6
but luckily thatll thatll all get straightened out	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6
you know you do do want them looking at your UNK necessarily	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 6 2 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
but i hate it when im im doing it	6 3 6 3 6 3 1 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 3 1 6 6
and so we were going down the highway you know	6 6 2 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6
it is	6 6	6 6
and i mean it it so boring	6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that the way i looked at it	3 1 2 4 3 2 4 3	3 1 6 4 4 4 3 3
oh you are	6 3 6	6 6 6
are you guys UNK	6 3 1 2	6 6 6 6
not yet	6 6	6 6
you know	6 3	6 6
strike against	7 6	6 6
i think we learned too much	3 6 3 6 7 5	3 6 3 6 6 4
oh what kind is it	6 7 5 6 3	6 6 6 6 6
and like you my UNK to my little pistol pistol probably uh	6 6 3 2 4 4 3 1 1 1 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6
than than	7 5	6 6
and it did look	6 3 6 6	6 3 6 6
whenever you donate money to someone	6 3 6 2 6 3	6 6 6 6 2 4
and they work at the same place i did	6 2 6 6 3 1 1 1 1	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6
i do do do it quite as much as i used to	3 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
ive ive come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 6 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4 4
it is	3 6	6 6
one time i UNK	7 5 3 7	6 6 6 6
there there plenty of money in the system	6 6 7 2 4 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4
we UNK what we needed	3 6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6 4
and there there been a lot made in the local papers of that fact	6 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4
uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4
know you UNK a bigger	6 3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6
and they do do allow um	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
you know look really	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
regardless of the racial UNK	6 6 7 5 5	6 6 2 4 4
oh wonderful	6 6	6 6
or sixteen- fifteen	6 6 2	6 6 6
i guess you just have to wonder	3 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
there there no way	6 6 3 1	3 1 6 6
ive- ive ive heard of that	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 4
what else	7 2	6 6
we sent them to camp	3 6 3 6 7	3 6 6 2 4
country would benefit	3 6 6	6 6 6
traded it in on the chevy van	6 3 6 6 3 1 1	6 6 6 6 4 4 6
because those kind of people i mean	6 2 4 4 4 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 6
you know UNK of people to be able to break in	6 7 5 5 2 7 5 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
we did did really watch it too much yesterday	2 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
and uh i UNK because women were UNK	6 6 3 6 6 2 6 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
that that tough	3 1 6	3 1 6
they were i was listening to some of the comments on radio- television the other day uh about it	6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4 4 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 6 6 4 4 4 6
was like last year they had forty	6 6 3 1 1 6 7	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
the rat race to exercise	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 2 4
as he he floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh	6 3 1 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 3
well i think the	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
i do do know	3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6
well are you ever are you	6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
alternate ways of uh	2 4 6 6	6 4 6 6
but whatever youre youre promised they just	6 3 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6
well i do not know	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6
he never	6 6	6 6
and he like his sales last year	6 6 6 2 4 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
i mean youve youve got a little place on one side or the other	6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 1 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
well that that about five minutes	6 3 1 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6
the only one area where a woman could could do it is if she just	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4
i do not know	6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
c v a e	2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6
well um you- you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
ill ill just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all	3 1 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
and they all went through it	6 3 7 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
you call	3 6	6 6
it was over crowded	2 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but uh you know with the technology we have today	6 6 6 6 6 7 5 3 7 2	6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 4
said my mom mom making me get rid of the bird	6 2 4 4 6 3 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 4
the UNK	7 5	2 4
but i remember carter	6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6
a guilty verdict if the facts warrant	2 4 4 4 3 1 2	2 4 4 6 2 4 4
uh UNK	6 6	6 6
hum uh	6 6	6 6
thatd thatd be kind of laughter-nice	3 1 6 6 6 6	3 6 7 5 6 6
and i brought her to a different vet this time	6 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 6
um they they feel	6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6
so you know that that so	6 6 6 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 4
and it really it really added up	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
i- i i have friends with UNK and UNK	6 6 3 6 2 4 4 4 4	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6
another thing is a lot of times	2 4 6 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 3 6 2 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i am very much for capital punishment	3 6 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 4 4 4
well what what what theyve theyve been able to do is slow down the rate of increase	6 6 6 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and and but of course most time most the time management has a hard time	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 3 1 4 6 2 4 4
my feeling is that	2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6
im im leaving the big city mom	2 4 6 2 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 4 6
it does tend to	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
let let say another audience let let say a north american	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4 3 1 2 2 4 4
and wisconsin	2 4	6 6
fairly extensive	6 6	6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
came in and said okay	6 6 6 6 6	6 6 2 4 4
come on	6 6	6 6
but im im like you	6 3 1 6 3	6 3 1 6 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
we take care of them	3 6 2 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
by two things	6 7 5	6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it	6 6 6 3 6 3 6 6 2 4 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3
and virginia and	2 3 2	6 6 6
the trash as they put it out	3 1 6 2 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
everybody was getting stuck in the mud	3 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4
im im not even	6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6
and that that suppose to be some of the uh male bonding and the	6 3 1 6 6 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6
i have have talked to uh	6 6 6 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
so youre youre working on your doctorate	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 2 4
from a long time ago	6 7 5 5 6	6 2 6 6 6
and uh do do know what theyre theyre doing and say one thing in the courtroom	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 7 5 6 7 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and while it had you know a few little UNK problems it was was very long and so forth	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
but i just	6 3 6	6 6 6
bellies a meal tax	7 2 4 4	6 2 4 4
it has to be one common	6 6 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 2 4 4
what gets me is i ca ca believe that congress um	3 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 4 4 4 4
and so you	6 6 6	6 6 6
i was just going to ask you how it you know if you liked the the	3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6
and then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family	6 6 3 1 6 6 3 6 2 4 6 6 3 7 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4
i work full time	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
and it it not UNK to the cafeteria now	6 3 1 6 6 6 3 1 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 2 4 4
and the people that came in it just was was it just was was the same	6 2 4 3 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 2 4
but they do a lot of low UNK low impact low stress exercise	6 3 6 7 5 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 2 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4 4
being from california and wanting to hear like	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 4 6 6 6 4 6
the UNK in one town	7 5 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 6
people of all ages take advantage of	2 4 7 5 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
i think that like you said television	3 6 6 6 3 6 3	3 6 3 6 6 6 4
we get cut off all the time too	2 6 6 6 7 5 5 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6
my mother uh was	3 1 6 6	6 4 4 6
and they say they can	6 3 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6
and theyre theyre	6 6 6	6 6 6
oh my goodness	6 6 6	3 6 6
have us	7 3	6 6
try to read everything they write	6 6 6 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
serious crimes	2 4	6 6
if the gun shop owner does it	6 2 4 4 4 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 6
you know people who had nothing else to do and were were very	6 2 4 3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4	6 3 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 1 4
oh uh-huh	6 6	6 6

i learned to shoot when i was real little	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6
of sherman	6 6	6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
got up until about the sixth	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6 6 6
it it so relaxing to just sit	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
which is something different um	3 2 3 2 4	6 2 4 4 6
and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 2 6 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
and you know now were were	6 6 6 6 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6
i ca ca really say recently	3 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 4
you know uh	6 2 4	6 6 6
and now i went back to work about a year and a half ago	6 6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 4 4

i do	3 6	6 6
if someone is from a foreign country	7 3 7 5 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 4
and ive ive just stuck with it	6 3 1 6 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 6 3
and it it wonderful	6 3 1 6	6 3 1 6
i mean uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
trucks and stuff	2 4 6	6 6 6

i had a uh	3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
UNK sort of modern looking restaurants will	2 4 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 2 4 4 4 6
somebody said you have to be drug tested	3 2 3 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4

i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test	3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 6 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
maybe maybe	3 1	3 1
finding a UNK	6 2 4	6 6 6
oh i did did realize that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 3
i read it	3 6 3	3 6 6
it it just because that i would be UNK every day	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4
the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate	6 7 5 5 5 2 4 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
so let let their country take care of it	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
for instance	6 6	6 6
not at all	6 6 6	6 3 6
yeah i do too	6 3 6 6	6 6 6 6
i just do do know how much theyll theyll	3 6 6 6 6 3 1 1 1	3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 4
and i could not handle that	6 3 6 6 6 3	6 3 6 2 4 4
the right to write your	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
i do do either	3 6 6 6	3 3 6 6
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 2	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
and then they wonder why it does does get done in the same amount of time	6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 4
we can find out what really happened	3 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 6 6 2 4 4 4
and im im getting more responsibility	6 3 1 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 4
because1 uh i guess we do do trust the school systems which is really sad	6 6 3 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4 6 2 4 4
and it it away and all that	6 3 1 6 6 2 4	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
it it UNK you know	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
and it broke like in the middle of nowhere	6 3 6 6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
i did not know the UNK hyacinths were going to die	3 6 6 6 3 1 1 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6 2 4
that was his big deal	3 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6
a lot of times it it too	7 5 2 4 6 6 7	6 6 3 6 6 6 6
i feel i feel for them	6 6 3 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
but um	6 6	6 6
im im not really sure	3 1 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
i like to watch them too	3 6 6 6 3 6	3 6 6 6 6 6
yeah is um	3 6 6	3 6 6
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
im im in plano	3 1 6 2	3 1 6 6
just go to my garage and grab it	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
drug testing procedures would have to be refined	2 4 4 6 6 6 6 6	6 4 6 6 6 6 6 4
there are areas where we could uh	6 6 2 4 3 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 4 6
and um his adaptations are usually really good	6 6 2 4 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and now the uh other team	6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
are you one of these uh	6 3 7 5 5 5	6 6 6 6 1 6
it it it really becoming a problem	6 6 6 6 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that right	3 1 6	3 1 6
there there certain areas where uh the crime is focused	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
UNK UNK	7 5	6 4
quarter fifty cents whatever in a	2 4 4 3 6 7	6 6 4 6 6 6
lot of lot of	6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6
coke machine up there	7 5 6 6	6 6 6 3
wear it for a year and a half	7 3 7 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 2 4 6 2 4
and i ca ca remember	6 3 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
well im im a im im a buffalo bills fan	6 6 6 6 3 1 2 4 4 4	6 3 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6
and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor	6 7 5 6 6 6 2	6 2 4 4 4 4 4
started a lot of stuff off	6 7 5 2 4 6	6 2 6 6 6 6
and uh	6 6	6 6
i believe if you do do have	3 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4
ours is the same	3 6 2 4	6 6 6 6
theyve theyve been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics	3 1 6 7 5 5 5 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 3 1	3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4
and the male is black	6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 6 6
and im im hoping	6 3 1 6	3 6 6 6
i mean i know yankees have won a lot UNK	6 6 3 6 2 6 6 2 4 4	3 6 2 4 6 6 6 2 4 4
i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting	3 6 2 4 4 7 5 5 2 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4
almost every game that i watched	2 4 4 3 1 6	6 6 4 6 2 4
i know it	3 6 3	6 6 6
it was like	6 6 6	3 6 6
it it	3 1	3 1
took it from me without me knowing really	6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 6 4 6
oh okay	6 6	6 6
but weve weve got some this year	6 3 1 6 7 3 1	6 3 1 6 6 6 6
that came to the reunion	3 6 6 3 1	6 6 6 2 4
there there uh	6 6 6	3 1 6
to tell them1 you know that youre youre not interested	6 6 2 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 6 6 2 6 6 3 1 6 6
little bit more than i want	2 4 4 6 3 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
theyve theyve been doing a lot of that in the area	3 1 6 6 3 1 1 1 6 2 4	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4
uh floor level minimum level that that a standard	7 5 5 5 5 3 1 7 5	6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 4
UNK using using the uh	2 4 4 4 4	6 6 4 6 6
it is	3 6	6 6
uh the the morals that they would be taught	2 4 7 5 3 2 7 5 5	6 6 6 4 6 6 6 4 4
if if they feel like there is a	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 7	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
that that very cool	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
um well im im not getting UNK	6 6 3 1 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 3
i i think that we should be spending more time	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 2 6 6 4 6 6
but i can be professional too	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4
but it it uh all the rooms are small	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
so mine are you know i use mine for recreation	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 2 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
that would be a part of selling it to the community	3 6 6 7 5 5 5 3 7 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4
sometimes UNK UNK the UNK or recognize	6 6 6 2 4 6 6	6 3 6 2 4 4 4
i think the only people who	3 6 2 4 4 3	6 6 6 6 6 6
where are you	6 6 3	6 6 6
the adults	7 5	2 4
two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5 3 7 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
it seems like there there it seems like there there a grass roots	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 3 6 2 4 4
oh yeah	6 6	6 6
certainly were were a powerhouse uh	2 4 4 7 5 2	6 3 1 2 4 4
let let get- see how much money we can get out of her you laughter-know	3 1 6 6 7 5 5 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6
especially when we have UNK	6 6 3 6 7	6 6 2 4 4
UNK that youre youre not	6 6 3 1 6	6 6 3 1 6
and she just liked having kids	6 3 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 6 6
been able to uh UNK that a little better	6 6 6 6 6 3 7 5 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 4
i mean you can just sit	6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6
i do do think wed wed need a whole church	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 2 4 4	3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 4
a a variety	6 2 4	6 2 4
in- in a lot of parts	6 6 7 5 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6
and the moody blues	6 2 4 4	6 3 6 6
well let let see	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it it big enough for us though	3 1 6 6 6 3 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
i think she got it	3 6 3 6 3	3 6 6 6 6
and i think that does make a difference	6 3 6 3 6 6 7 5	3 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
couple of levels of tests in terms of	7 2 7 2 4 6 6 6	6 2 4 6 6 6 6 6
UNK crimes like serial UNK or serial murderers or whatever	2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3	6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4
it really	6 6	6 6
that yes uh	6 6 6	6 6 6
well this is it was a regular uh electronics	6 3 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 4
i mean uh the last two uh years	6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
it it	6 6	3 1
and then the recycler	6 6 3 1	6 6 2 4
and i keep thinking you know	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
well it seems like there there there there a lot	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
it it nice	6 6 6	3 1 6
yes yes	3 1	3 1
and i will not do my oil changes	6 3 6 6 6 3 1 1	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and so i she does does remember anything	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 3	6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6
that we hear all the time is how you bring them1 up	3 1 2 4 4 4 6 6 3 6 2 6	6 6 6 6 2 4 4 3 6 6 6 4
i do do know	6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6
it was a really cute little kid too	6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 2 6 6 6 6 6
also i lived in georgia for about four years	6 3 6 6 2 6 7 5 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4
wanted the right to do that	6 7 5 5 5 3	6 3 6 6 6 6
so it just turned out to be too much of a	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
im im trying to think back now	3 1 6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6 6 6
you know	6 6	6 6
it does does matter	3 6 6 6	3 6 6 6
but it was a big UNK	6 6 6 2 4 4	6 3 6 2 4 4
and that seems to be one of the	6 3 6 6 6 7 2 4	6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
appeal process	2 4	6 4
incredible logistics	2 4	6 6
ive ive got to have time	3 1 6 6 6 2	3 1 6 6 6 6
and the suspension thing it also	2 4 4 4 3 2	6 6 4 6 6 4
um ive ive never noticed that	6 3 1 6 6 3	6 3 1 6 6 4
uh was	6 6	6 6
my wife does uh a small UNK garden on the side	3 1 6 6 2 4 4 4 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4
the good job in the past	2 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 2 4
the computer was supposed to have two	3 1 6 6 6 6 7	3 6 6 6 6 6 4
i do do know if he still does or what because1 i do do know if sam sam is actually part of it	3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 3	3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 2 4 6 4 4 6 6
random testing	2 4	6 6
and then you can make that ahead	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 6 6 6 4
he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing	3 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6 2 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 4 6 6
perhaps the UNK industry is UNK	6 7 5 5 6 6	6 2 4 4 6 4
it it um	3 1 6	3 1 6
first house	2 4	6 6
was did did really want to be there and	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6
UNK of what they should be like uh	7 5 3 1 7 5 5 5	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6
so theyre theyre giving the early UNK	6 3 1 6 7 5 5	6 3 1 6 6 6 4
were were in a recession here	3 1 6 7 5 6	3 1 6 2 4 6
and i was watching it again	6 3 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6
i i tried to have um	6 3 6 6 6 6	6 3 6 6 6 6
it kill it	3 6 3	6 6 6
uh apparently uh there there they have have uh	6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 4 6 6 4 6
i was just	3 6 6	6 6 6
now come laughter-on let let be realistic	6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
uh right	6 6	6 6
otherwise he might have been driving trucks or UNK houses you know from here to UNK	6 3 6 6 6 6 7 6 6 7 6 6 6 6 6 2	6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 4
i think	3 6	6 6
so does insurance pay for the body damage	6 6 7 6 6 2 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
then it got	6 3 6	6 6 6
they do do they do do recognize any time difference do they	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 7 5 5 6 3	6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
but but you have to do it as part is	6 6 3 6 6 6 3 6 7 2	3 1 7 5 3 6 6 2 4 4
and i can pick it out again because it it not typical	6 3 6 6 3 6 6 6 3 1 6 6	6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 4
and at an early age	6 6 7 5 5	6 3 6 6 6
do do run too fast	6 6 6 6 6	3 1 6 6 6
had been shot out of one church	6 6 6 6 6 7 5	6 6 6 6 6 6 4
and he he since then has has UNK that and	6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 3 6	6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 3
but it it not as it it not like uh UNK where it it got that much UNK to it	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 3 2 6 6 2 4 4 4 4 6	6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 6 6 3 1 6 6 4 4 6 3
because all the eligible voters	6 2 4 4 4	6 6 2 4 4
um if it was some- you know coming into the store and stuff then she would had- whoever made the purchase would have had- sign some kind of um	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 3 1 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 4 4
for the last four years before i traded it for this	6 2 4 4 4 6 3 6 3 6 3	6 3 6 6 6 6 2 4 6 6 4
UNK about the	7 5 5	6 6 6
the UNK sentence on what the person did	2 4 4 6 3 2 4 6	3 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
that have several openings	3 2 4 4	6 6 6 6
group your UNK problems together	6 2 4 4 6	6 2 4 4 4
well well damn right	3 1 6 6	3 1 6 6
and they work all day	6 3 6 2 4	6 3 6 6 6
and it is is because of the well	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 6 4 6 6 4 4
you know	6 6	6 6
i think that that what what happening	3 6 3 1 1 1 6	6 6 6 6 3 1 6
if i was a cop id id be	6 3 6 2 4 3 1 6	6 6 6 2 4 6 6 6
the the	6 6	6 6
and i guess-	6 3 6	6 6 6
trying to	6 6	6 6
and so my budget comes from my dad dad help	6 6 2 4 6 6 2 4 4 4	6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 4 4
like the world UNK them something	2 4 4 4 3 1	6 3 6 6 6 6
and i do do see why it could could be UNK considerably	6 3 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6	6 6 3 1 6 6 6 2 4 4 4 4
fancier or more courses than the other	6 6 2 4 4 4 4	6 6 6 4 4 4 4
