f1ajrlp1-0000.000-0003.480 wanted chief justice of the massachusetts supreme court
f1ajrlp1-0003.480-0012.530 in april the sjc current leader edward hennessy reaches a mandatory retirement age of seventy and a successor is expected to be named in march
f1ajrlp1-0012.530-0018.160 it may be the most important appointment governor michael dukakis makes during the remainder of his administration
f1ajrlp1-0018.160-0024.590 and one of the toughest as wbur margo melnicove reports hennessy will be a hard act to follow
f1ajrlp2-0000.000-0006.870 in nineteen seventy six democratic governor michael dukakis fulfilled a campaign promise to de-politicize judicial appointment
f1ajrlp2-0006.870-0011.310 he named republican edward hennessy to head the state supreme judicial court
f1ajrlp2-0011.310-0016.610 for hennessy it was another step along a distinguished career that began as a trial lawyer
f1ajrlp2-0016.610-0021.150 and led to an appointment as associate supreme court justice in nineteen seventy one
f1ajrlp2-0021.150-0027.230 that year thomas maffy now president of the massachusetts bar association was hennessy law clerk
f1ajrlp3-0000.000-0008.620 the author of more than eight hundred state supreme court opinions hennessy is widely respected for his legal scholarship and his administrative abilities
f1ajrlp3-0008.620-0018.000 admirers give hennessy much of the credit for sweeping court reform that began a decade ago and for last year legislative approval of thirty five new judgeships
f1ajrlp3-0018.000-0021.690 and three hundred million dollars to restore crumbling court houses
f1ajrlp3-0021.690-0029.980 despite the state massive budget deficit hennessy recently urged colleagues in the bar association not to retreat from these hard won gains
f1ajrlp4-0000.000-0003.280 hennessy is the sjc thirty second chief justice
f1ajrlp4-0003.280-0006.000 holding the court system on the course he has set
f1ajrlp4-0006.000-0010.390 and plotting it future agenda wo be an easy job for his successor
f1ajrlp5-0000.000-0008.720 attorney haskel kassler chairs the judicial nominating council eighteen attorneys and laypeople charged with screening applicants for vacancies on the bench
f1ajrlp5-0008.720-0012.730 usually the jnc refers three nominees to the governor
f1ajrlp5-0012.730-0017.850 his top choice is rated by bar associations and grilled by the governor executive council
f1ajrlp5-0017.850-0026.250 kassler says unlike the federal supreme court there no litmus test on particular issues that massachusetts high court nominees must pass
f1ajrlp6-0000.000-0008.760 all but one of the chief justices since eighteen ninety nine when oliver wendell holmes was appointed came from the ranks of sjc associate justices
f1ajrlp6-0008.760-0014.270 if he sticks with tradition dukakis is likely to elevate one of his appointees to chief
f1ajrlp6-0014.270-0018.460 that means paul leocos or ruth abrams the only woman on the court
f1ajrlp6-0018.460-0025.790 another possible choice is herbert wilkins a governor sargent appointee and next to hennessy the court most senior member
f1ajrlp6-0025.790-0030.690 the three other associate justices were put on the bench by governor edward king
f1ajrlp6-0030.690-0039.800 and many lawyers say that despite dukakis promise to keep the judiciary above the political fray it unlikely dukakis will choose a king appointee
f1ajrlp6-0039.800-0041.560 to run the state highest court
f1ajrlp6-0041.560-0045.330 for wbur im margo melnicove
f1aprlp2-0000.000-0007.280 the device is attached to a plastic wristband it looks like a watch it functions like an electronic probation officer
f1aprlp2-0007.280-0014.500 when a computerized call is made to a former prisoner home phone that person answers by plugging in the device
f1aprlp2-0014.500-0021.430 the wristband can be removed only by breaking its clasp and if that done the inmate is immediately returned to jail
f1aprlp2-0021.430-0025.350 the description conjures up images of big brother watching
f1aprlp2-0025.350-0033.170 but jay ash deputy superintendent of the hampton county jail in springfield says the surveillance system is not that sinister
f1aprlp3-0000.000-0008.140 such supervision according to ash is a sensible cost effective alternative to incarceration that should not alarm civil libertarians
f1aprlp3-0008.140-0014.020 doctor norman rosenblatt dean of the college of criminal justice at northeastern university agrees
f1aprlp4-0000.000-0008.700 rosenblatt expects electronic surveillance in parole situations to become more wide spread and he thinks eventually people will get used to the idea
f1aprlp4-0008.700-0020.740 springfield jail deputy superintendent ash says although it will allow some prisoners to be released a few months before their sentences are up concerns that may raise about public safety are not well founded
f1aprlp4-0020.740-0027.530 most county jail inmates did not commit violent crimes theyre in jail for such things as bad checks or stealing
f1aprlp4-0027.530-0038.330 those on early release must check in with corrections officials fifty times a week according to ash who says about half the contacts for a select group will now be made by computerized phone calls
f1aprlp4-0038.330-0041.990 initially the program will involve only a handful of inmates
f1aprlp4-0041.990-0046.650 ash says the ultimate goal is to use it to get about forty out of jail early
f1aprlp4-0046.650-0051.630 the springfield jail built for two hundred seventy people now houses more than five hundred
f1aprlp4-0051.630-0054.930 for wbur im margo melnicove
f1arrlp1-0000.000-0007.030 massachusetts may now have the toughest drunken driving law in the nation thanks to the safe roads act that became law this week
f1arrlp1-0007.030-0015.300 the legislation came complete with a message from the governor to those seeking a little too much comfort and joy this holiday season and beyond
f1arrlp2-0000.000-0004.350 under the new law the consequences of driving drunk will be swift and severe
f1arrlp2-0004.350-0010.180 under the old already tough law first time offenders used to lose their license for thirty days
f1arrlp2-0010.180-0012.830 well now they could lose it for as many as ninety
f1arrlp2-0012.830-0016.400 the prison sentence for a second time offender has now doubled
f1arrlp2-0016.400-0022.260 the law is also tougher for vehicular homicide and it cracks down on minors who drink and drive
f1arrlp2-0022.260-0027.530 state trooper joseph holly says this tough new law will mean fewer drunken drivers
f1arrlp3-0000.000-0004.700 well that what supporters of the safe roads act are hoping anyway but will it work
f1arrlp3-0004.700-0008.030 massachusetts got tough on drunken drivers years ago
f1arrlp3-0008.030-0010.390 what going to make the difference this time around
f1arrlp3-0010.390-0017.080 ralph henksen is chief of the social and behavioral science section at the boston university school of public health
f1arrlp3-0017.080-0028.120 he says research into what deters the drunken driver shows that often those who drink and drive are risk takers even when theyre sober theyre more likely to run red lights and shun the seat belt
f1arrlp3-0028.120-0032.450 if they think they can drink and drive and get away with it theyll try
f1arrlp4-0000.000-0003.430 and in fact the state is not planning on putting more police on the road
f1arrlp4-0003.430-0012.180 state officials say there will be the same levels of enforcement bu professor henksen believes the key to the new law success is its enforcement
f1arrlp5-0000.000-0005.215 the state safe roads act is only a few days old but it already facing a challenge
f1arrlp5-0005.215-0011.385 the man who directed the successful effort last election to get the mandatory seat belt law stripped from the law books
f1arrlp5-0011.385-0014.371 is now vowing to try to repeal part of this law
f1arrlp5-0014.371-0027.866 lynn activist chip ford has yet to give a name to his committee but he already set its goal to repeal what is the most controversial clause in the safe roads act the per se clause which allows someone to be punished for drinking and driving
f1arrlp5-0027.866-0029.968 before theyve even been tried in court
f1arrlp5-0029.968-0042.574 under the per se part of this new law if youre arrested take a breath test and your blood content levels register point one oh or higher you can automatically lose your license for ninety days
f1arrlp5-0042.574-0048.475 and that just at your arraignment then youve still got to face dwi charges at a trial
f1arrlp5-0048.475-0053.795 state officials say about a quarter of all those arrested for drunken driving are repeat offenders
f1arrlp5-0053.795-0057.332 they say the per se clause will get those people off the road sooner
f1arrlp5-0057.332-0063.770 chip ford says it may indeed get them off the road but it will do it at the expense of their civil rights
f1arrlp6-0000.000-0008.260 ford and other opponents of the per se clause say it relies exclusively on the breath test and they say breathalizers are simply unreliable
f1arrlp6-0008.260-0013.630 john tarantino is a providence attorney who specializes in drunken driving cases
f1arrlp7-0000.000-0009.496 tarantino says because of people physiological differences the breathalizer test will always be inaccurate on about fourteen percent of the population
f1arrlp7-0009.496-0014.225 those people will register as having more alcohol in their blood than they actually do
f1arrlp7-0014.225-0017.011 but state officials are convinced that a problem
f1arrlp7-0017.011-0027.279 while they do say breathalizers are one hundred percent accurate they do say they are extremely reliable and if they err at all it on the conservative side the side favorable to the driver
f1arrlp7-0027.279-0037.114 as for those who say that taking away someone license based on the breathalizer results is tantamount to trial by machine state officials say that simply is so
f1arrlp7-0037.114-0041.353 losing one license under the per se clause is not a criminal offense
f1arrlp7-0041.353-0053.439 you wo get a criminal record for it it a civil infraction and one that they believe will be a key deterrent to the drunken driver if the clause is tested in court the state says it will pass constitutional muster
f1arrlp7-0053.439-0061.267 and if opponents gather enough signatures to make it a ballot question in nineteen eighty eight state officials predict voters will keep it intact

f1atrlp3-0000.000-0003.390 this last young mother-to-be is luckier than many
f1atrlp3-0003.390-0016.730 she and the father of her child are married and are planning for the future and even though she been sexually active since she was twelve she avoided unwanted pregnancies by using birth control pills that her mother helped her get at a local hospital
f1atrlp3-0016.730-0025.670 these three young woman like the idea of school based health clinics if one had existed in their schools they say they would have used it for someone to talk to about sex
f1atrlp3-0025.670-0028.120 and for a safe place to get birth control
f1atrlp3-0028.120-0034.920 a pilot project to set up such clinics in two to four boston middle and high schools was proposed last spring

f1atrlp4-0000.000-0012.560 these claims are disputed by the head of the task force doctor deborah prothro-stith she says since students do use existing services school-based clinics would be an alternative rather than a duplication
f1atrlp4-0012.560-0019.510 and she says like health care in the work place the thrust of health care in the schools is to overcome access barriers
f1atrlp5-0000.000-0017.190 kids do have sex because contraceptives are or are not available according to prothro-stith and while she does not condone sexual activity among teens she thinks medically it unfair to deny access to contraceptives to some

f1atrlp6-0000.000-0016.820 prothro-stith points out that if school-based clinics were established parental permission would be required for students to receive each service offered and that birth control would be only part of a comprehensive program dealing with other adolescent issues like depression suicide and eating disorders

f1atrlp6-0018.750-0021.620 that the roots of these problems dig deep into society
f1atrlp6-0021.620-0030.070 but while conroy strongly opposes school-based clinics as a solution calling them a bandaid that wo work prothro-stith says
f1atrlp6-0030.070-0035.790 both attention to teenagers immediate needs as well as long range prevention and health education are needed
f1atrlp7-0000.000-0004.000 problems associated with the proposal to set up health clinics in schools
f1atrlp7-0004.000-0010.860 are also expected to multiply if superintendent of schools laval wilson goes along with the idea next month

f2brrlp1-0006.580-0013.620 the legislation came complete with a message from the governor to those seeking a little too much comfort and joy this holiday season and beyond
f2brrlp2-0000.000-0004.130 under the new law the consequences of driving drunk will be swift and severe
f2brrlp2-0004.130-0009.930 under the old already tough law first time offenders used to lose their license for thirty days
f2brrlp2-0009.930-0012.310 well now they could lose it for as many as ninety
f2brrlp2-0012.310-0021.440 the prison sentence for a second time offender has now doubled the law is also tougher for vehicular homicide and it cracks down on minors who drink and drive
f2brrlp2-0021.440-0026.320 state trooper joseph holly says this tough new law will mean fewer drunken drivers
f2brrlp3-0000.000-0007.100 well that what supporters of the safe roads act are hoping anyway but will it work massachusetts got tough on drunken drivers years ago
f2brrlp3-0007.100-0009.570 what going to make the difference this time around
f2brrlp3-0009.570-0016.100 ralph henksen is chief of the social and behavioral science section at the boston university school of public health
f2brrlp3-0016.100-0019.200 he says research into what deters the drunken driver
f2brrlp3-0019.200-0022.650 shows that often those who drink and drive are risk takers
f2brrlp3-0022.650-0026.990 even when theyre sober theyre more likely to run red lights and shun the seat belt
f2brrlp3-0026.990-0030.530 if they think they can drink and drive and get away with it theyll try
f2brrlp4-0000.000-0011.900 and in fact the state is not planning on putting more police on the road state officials say there will be the same levels of enforcement bu professor henksen believes the key to the new law success is its enforcement
f2brrlp5-0000.000-0004.350 the state safe roads act is only a few days old but it already facing a challenge
f2brrlp5-0004.350-0010.240 the man who directed the successful effort last election to get the mandatory seat belt law stripped from the law books
f2brrlp5-0010.240-0013.020 is now vowing to try to repeal part of this law
f2brrlp5-0013.020-0015.100 lynn activist chip ford
f2brrlp5-0015.100-0026.680 has yet to give a name to his committee but he already set its goal to repeal what is the most controversial clause in the safe roads act the per se clause which allows someone to be punished for drinking and driving
f2brrlp5-0026.680-0029.020 before theyve even been tried in court
f2brrlp5-0029.020-0040.790 under the per se part of this new law if youre arrested take a breath test and your blood content level registers point one oh or higher you can automatically lose your license for ninety days
f2brrlp5-0040.790-0042.590 and that just at your arraignment
f2brrlp5-0042.590-0046.100 then you still got to face dwi charges at a trial
f2brrlp5-0046.100-0052.400 state officials say about a quarter of all those arrested for drunken driving are repeat offenders they say the per se clause
f2brrlp5-0052.400-0054.870 will get those people off the road sooner
f2brrlp5-0054.870-0061.290 chip ford says it may indeed get them off the road but it will do it at the expense of their civil rights
f2brrlp6-0000.000-0008.070 ford and other opponents of the per se clause say it relies exclusively on the breath test and they say breathalizers are simply unreliable
f2brrlp6-0008.070-0013.060 john tarantino is a providence attorney who specializes in drunken driving cases
f2brrlp7-0000.000-0008.480 tarantino says because of people physiological differences the breathalizer test will always be inaccurate on about fourteen percent of the population
f2brrlp7-0008.480-0013.320 those people will register as having more alcohol in their blood than they actually do
f2brrlp7-0013.320-0027.150 but state officials are convinced that a problem while they do say breathalizers are one hundred percent accurate they do say they are extremely reliable and if they err at all it on the conservative side the side favorable to the driver
f2brrlp7-0027.150-0031.860 as for those who say that taking away someone license based on the breathalizer results
f2brrlp7-0031.860-0036.640 is tantamount to trial by machine state officials say that simply is so
f2brrlp7-0036.640-0041.060 losing one license under the per se clause is not a criminal offense
f2brrlp7-0041.060-0044.770 you wo get a criminal record for it it is a civil infraction
f2brrlp7-0044.770-0048.460 and one that they believe will be a key deterrent to the drunken driver
f2brrlp7-0048.460-0053.780 if the per se clause is tested in court the state says it will pass constitutional muster
f2brrlp7-0053.780-0061.640 and if opponents gather enough signatures to make it a ballot question in nineteen eighty eight state officials predict voters will keep it intact
f2bs01p1-0000.000-0005.770 a nineteen eighteen state constitutional amendment made massachusetts one of twenty three states
f2bs01p1-0005.770-0008.960 where citizens can enact laws by plebiscite
f2bs01p1-0008.960-0012.060 the first ballot initiative adopted by bay staters
f2bs01p1-0012.060-0013.750 was a nineteen twenty measure
f2bs01p1-0013.750-0019.550 that defined cider and beer as non-intoxicating exempting them from prohibition
f2bs01p1-0019.550-0033.380 a nineteen forty eight initiative to legalize contraceptives was defeated but perhaps the state most famous initiative was proposition two and a half one in a series of recent anti-tax measures on ballots across the country
f2bs01p1-0033.380-0040.340 since nineteen sixty eight voter initiated propositions have mushroomed by more than six hundred percent
f2bs01p1-0040.340-0042.700 heightened awareness of the process
f2bs01p1-0042.700-0051.760 may be one reason why more petitions were certified this year in massachusetts than ever before says the secretary of state chief legal counsel david sullivan
f2bs01p2-0000.000-0007.580 director of the mccormick public affairs institute at u-mass boston doctor ed beard says the push for do it yourself lawmaking
f2bs01p2-0007.580-0011.140 comes from voters who feel frustrated by their elected officials
f2bs01p2-0011.140-0015.340 but the initiative process worries beard and other political scientists
f2bs01p2-0015.340-0022.210 who say it can offer simplistic solutions for complex problems such as taxation and nuclear energy
f2bs01p2-0022.210-0024.560 yet beard remains ambivalent
f2bs01p2-0024.560-0027.530 because he ca totally write off an institution
f2bs01p2-0027.530-0030.480 that makes democracy more participatory
f2bs01p3-0000.000-0013.280 in a study of seventy two ballot issues in massachusetts and three other states boston university political science professor betty zisk found that eighty eight percent of the battles were won by the side that spent the most money
f2bs01p3-0013.280-0016.290 still zisk applauds voter initiatives
f2bs01p3-0016.290-0019.090 saying they should be held to a higher standard
f2bs01p3-0019.090-0021.690 than laws enacted by legislatures
f2bs02p1-0000.000-0005.957 hydropower from the roaring branch and walloomsac rivers
f2bs02p1-0005.957-0009.905 attracted industry to bennington in the late seventeen hundreds
f2bs02p1-0009.905-0013.977 today light manufacturing is still the community mainstay
f2bs02p1-0013.977-0018.346 some three hundred residents work at johnson controls battery plant
f2bs02p1-0018.346-0020.936 where wages of thirteen dollars an hour and up
f2bs02p1-0020.936-0030.109 are considered top dollar for the area < noise > about a mile from the plant beyond an historic covered bridge spanning the walloomsac
f2bs02p1-0030.109-0047.971 some johnson controls employees who may make history themselves brth talk about the company fetal protection policy brth management wo allow reporters into the factory brth so joanne and richard leard offer their home as a meeting place brth mister leard has worked at the battery plant for twenty five years
f2bs02p1-0047.971-0064.121 he was president of the united auto workers union local in nineteen eighty two brth when johnson controls instituted a new policy brth it banned fertile women from working in areas where they would be exposed to lead brth in order to protect fetuses should the workers become pregnant
f2bs02p2-0000.000-0005.550 the policy also is humiliating says joanne leard a union health and safety monitor
f2bs02p2-0005.550-0008.670 who worked at johnson controls for sixteen years
f2bs02p3-0000.000-0008.430 and virginia green says in her case the policy is infuriating shed had her children before she began working at johnson controls
f2bs02p3-0008.430-0010.760 and did worry about lead exposure
f2bs02p3-0010.760-0024.360 in fact green says she enjoyed her job as a plate stacker but when the fetal protection policy took effect green was transferred to a low lead area her base salary remained the same but she lost incentive pay
f2bs02p3-0024.360-0027.180 green was fifty years old at the time
f2bs02p4-0000.000-0007.760 green several of her bennington co-workers and employees at some of johnson controls fifteen other manufacturing plants filed grievances
f2bs02p4-0007.760-0010.180 which led to a class action lawsuit
f2bs02p4-0010.180-0016.120 company officials refused to comment but their position paper on the fetal protection policy
f2bs02p4-0016.120-0024.440 maintains that certain blood lead levels while safe for adults cause birth defects if passed through the placenta to a fetus
f2bs02p4-0024.440-0028.390 according to the document it would be morally reprehensible
f2bs02p4-0028.390-0034.640 to knowingly poison unborn children by allowing fertile women to work in high lead areas
f2bs02p4-0034.640-0044.200 doctor jay julian chism director of the kennedy institute lead program at johns hopkins university has studied lead poisoning for some thirty five years
f2bs02p4-0044.200-0049.720 in the case against johnson controls chism provided an affidavit on the company behalf
f2bs02p4-0049.720-0057.010 he says unless lead standards are lowered throughout the workplace the only way to ensure that fetuses are not at risk
f2bs02p4-0057.010-0059.400 is to remove from lead areas
f2bs02p4-0059.400-0061.530 anyone who may become pregnant
f2bs02p5-0000.000-0008.130 but research on pregnancy and lead poisoning is not conclusive according to university of wisconsin labor law professor karen klaus
f2bs02p5-0008.130-0015.770 there also evidence she says that men with high blood lead levels may through their sperm endanger their offspring
f2bs02p5-0015.770-0018.830 klaus represented the uaw in its appeal
f2bs02p5-0018.830-0024.010 she says similar fetal protection policies have been struck down by other federal courts
f2bs02p5-0024.010-0026.260 on the grounds that theyre discriminatory
f2bs02p5-0026.260-0028.610 but times have changed she says
f2bs02p5-0028.610-0032.850 because of the nationwide debate over abortion and fetal rights
f2bs02p6-0000.000-0009.680 other opponents say the issue for johnson controls is not fetal protection but protecting the company from lawsuits should an employee child have birth defects
f2bs02p6-0009.680-0015.560 if the mother never worked in a lead area the theory goes she ca blame johnson controls
f2bs02p6-0015.560-0020.840 the uaw has until the end of the year to petition the us supreme court to hear the case
f2bs02p6-0020.840-0028.140 if the policy stands critics say it will institutionalize the second class employment status of all fertile women
f2bs02p6-0028.140-0031.600 and higher paying albeit more hazardous jobs
f2bs02p6-0031.600-0033.580 will be reserved for men

f2bs03p1-0000.000-0014.560 this is margo melnicove at a news conference yesterday in mission hill near the site of the stuart shootings boston mayor ray flynn vehemently denied charges that there a double standard in the city that white life is more important than black life
f2bs03p2-0000.000-0004.390 the problem said flynn is that there are enough financial and human resources
f2bs03p2-0004.390-0017.720 to protect the public safety and improve the quality of life federal and state budget cuts have created a public service crisis he said with drug treatment and law enforcement only two of the casualties
f2bs03p2-0017.720-0022.020 flynn offered a remedy that he admits is not likely to be popular
f2bs03p3-0000.000-0007.550 flynn said with local option taxes such as an increase in sales tax the money goes to the community that generates it
f2bs03p3-0007.550-0014.800 for example a one cent sales tax increase said flynn would add thirty five million dollars a year to the city treasury
f2bs03p3-0014.800-0018.880 the mayor said soon hell seek legislative approval of such a tax
f2bs03p3-0018.880-0025.630 with boston share earmarked for public safety youth outreach programs and educational reform
f2bs03p3-0025.630-0030.550 yesterday the boston city council called for an emergency meeting with flynn next monday
f2bs03p3-0030.550-0038.840 to put other strategies on the table including a new court to handle drug related cases expansion of neighborhood crime watch efforts
f2bs03p3-0038.840-0041.040 and a beefed up budget for police
f2bs03p3-0041.040-0043.790 these ideas have been floated before
f2bs03p3-0043.790-0052.010 louis alisa president of the n double acp boston branch says it sad that it takes the death of a white woman from the suburbs
f2bs03p3-0052.010-0057.020 to create an urgency to rid boston of drugs poverty and guns
f2bs03p4-0000.000-0007.730 but the stuart tragedy may send another message says the head of boston university urban studies and public policy program joseph boscan
f2bs03p5-0000.000-0004.860 boston is already divided says boscan in terms of class race and ethnicity
f2bs03p5-0004.860-0009.660 and in a fragmented city he says one finds a great deal of violence
f2bs03p5-0009.660-0012.500 for wbur im margo melnicove

f2bs04p2-0013.770-0018.190 out of the state total illegal immigrant population of one hundred thousand
f2bs04p2-0018.190-0022.630 general relief is for needy families and unemployable adults
f2bs04p2-0022.630-0025.420 who do qualify for other public assistance
f2bs04p2-0025.420-0028.270 welfare department spokeswoman michael reganburg
f2bs04p2-0028.270-0034.960 says the state will save about one million dollars a year if illegal aliens are denied general relief
f2bs04p3-0000.000-0010.350 reganburg says if state finances improve benefits may become available to illegal aliens again but several legislators have filed bills to make sure that does happen
f2bs04p3-0010.350-0012.810 republican senator david lock bill
f2bs04p3-0012.810-0019.390 would permanently deny illegal aliens all state benefits except emergency medical assistance
f2bs04p4-0000.000-0002.700 but advocates for undocumented immigrants
f2bs04p4-0002.700-0009.420 say only the most desperate apply for public assistance and without it theyll be hungry and homeless
f2bs04p4-0009.420-0020.540 advocates also say most immigrants come here for legitimate reasons but they ca get asylum because federal immigration policy is biased especially against central americans
f2bs04p4-0020.540-0025.920 attorney michael altman advises the massachusetts immigrant and refugee advocacy coalition
f2bs04p4-0025.920-0031.990 altman says it immoral to deny anyone documented or not life basic necessities
f2bs04p4-0031.990-0034.140 and it also may be illegal
f2bs04p5-0000.000-0004.970 regulations banning general relief for illegal aliens take effect next month

f2bs05p1-0000.000-0006.100 the state public health department must inspect everything from milk plants to hospitals to police station lockups
f2bs05p1-0006.100-0009.170 state inspectors also assist local boards of health
f2bs05p1-0009.170-0017.110 these part time boards are the only health inspectors in one hundred and sixty two small massachusetts communities so state workers often step in
f2bs05p1-0017.110-0020.360 to survey restaurants septic systems housing
f2bs05p1-0020.360-0023.610 and towns that employ fulltime public health agents
f2bs05p1-0023.610-0025.690 often turn to the state for training
f2bs05p1-0025.690-0028.630 state public health deputy commissioner van dunn
f2bs05p1-0028.630-0036.370 admits recent layoffs will mean less help for local boards and may make the state more reactive than prevention oriented
f2bs05p1-0036.370-0042.980 dunn says the food and drug division for example expects its annual inspections to drop by fifteen hundred
f2bs05p1-0042.980-0048.320 but dunn says with some staff reshuffling hell make the best of a bad situation
f2bs05p1-0048.320-0050.640 and continue to protect public health
f2bs05p2-0000.000-0009.040 this sounds like a physical impossibility to greater boston legal services housing attorney jeff purcell who says near elimination of state sanitarians
f2bs05p2-0009.040-0011.670 portends a tenant rights crisis
f2bs05p2-0011.670-0017.120 the state used to employ seven sanitarians now two must cover all of massachusetts
f2bs05p2-0017.120-0022.750 their work is cut out for them with inspections of prisons state operated camp grounds and swimming pools
f2bs05p2-0022.750-0025.420 and farm labor camps required by law
f2bs05p2-0025.420-0028.590 purcell says there no way they can also take on
f2bs05p2-0028.590-0036.550 the sanitarian traditional role of inspector of last resort when local officials fail to crack down on slum lords
f2bs05p3-0000.000-0005.630 purcell warns that this winter more tenants than usual will have to put up with inadequate heat and hot water
f2bs05p3-0005.630-0009.070 while they await a state sanitarian who may never show
f2bs05p3-0009.070-0014.770 director of the division of healthcare quality priscilla plato says delays are also expected

f2bs06p1-0000.000-0004.530 ice is a smokable potent form of methamphetamine or speed

f2bs06p1-0007.600-0013.800 ice wreaks havoc on the body causing increased blood pressure tremors acne and other physical damage
f2bs06p1-0013.800-0020.120 but doctor alonso plow boston city hospital deputy commissioner for public health says what most alarming
f2bs06p1-0020.120-0025.030 are the psychological effects of ice once the initial euphoria subsides
f2bs06p2-0000.000-0006.640 plow says in san diego california nearly one third of all homicides now involve people high on ice
f2bs06p2-0006.640-0014.220 but by the time the drug shows up in boston plow hopes the word on the street will be that playing with ice is in fact playing with fire

f2bs06p2-0030.350-0033.670 with a couple of small seizures made the last few days
f2bs06p3-0000.000-0005.260 dodge says prevention efforts in la run the gamut instead of focusing on a particular drug
f2bs06p3-0005.260-0007.850 in chicago a police spokeswoman says
f2bs06p3-0007.850-0015.620 there fear that publicity will only arouse demand for ice so until the drug hits chicago therell be no campaign against it
f2bs06p3-0015.620-0022.450 but in boston deputy superintendent of the drug control unit james wood says information is the best weapon
f2bs06p3-0022.450-0028.940 wood applauds the upcoming campaign which will be similar to a media and classroom blitz waged a few years ago
f2bs06p3-0028.940-0031.510 after new york police tipped off boston
f2bs06p3-0031.510-0034.960 that smokable cocaine or crack was headed north
f2bs06p4-0000.000-0004.650 wood credits the city anti-crack campaign with keeping that drug under control
f2bs06p4-0004.650-0013.630 boston has a crack problem he admits but it nothing compared to the epidemic in other cities and maybe says wood similar education efforts

f2bs07p5-0015.800-0020.530 many gays are still afraid to come out of the closet to take a public stand
f2bs07p5-0020.530-0023.750 but this customer at fritz has another theory
f2bs08p1-0000.000-0010.470 barney frank district stretches from upscale democratic newton through affluent mostly republican suburbs such as wellseley and dover to the working class milltown of fall river
f2bs08p1-0010.470-0012.450 his diverse constituents
f2bs08p1-0012.450-0021.660 have agreed repeatedly that frank serves them well as a champion of equal rights affordable housing the elderly and reduced defense spending
f2bs08p1-0021.660-0025.190 frank won his fifth congressional term in nineteen eighty eight
f2bs08p1-0025.190-0031.110 with seventy percent of the vote despite his public announcement a year earlier that he a homosexual
f2bs08p1-0031.110-0032.940 frank more recent admission
f2bs08p1-0032.940-0036.280 that he paid for sex before he came out of the closet
f2bs08p1-0036.280-0047.480 and that he once employed a male prostitute as his housekeeper and driver initially angered many constituents according to dorothy wrikhard but the director of frank district offices
f2bs08p1-0047.480-0050.900 says now calls of support are pouring in
f2bs08p2-0000.000-0004.440 wrikhard says supporters have outnumbered detractors by about eight to one
f2bs08p2-0004.440-0012.020 and the frank campaign has received seventeen hundred dollars in unsolicited donations with another three thousand dollars pledged
f2bs08p2-0012.020-0018.940 but a survey in frank district last week showed a precipitous fourteen point drop in his favorability rating
f2bs08p2-0018.940-0023.380 and pollster jerry travinski says the numbers may not have bottomed out
f2bs08p3-0000.000-0004.380 some pollsters say voters most likely to be turned off by frank conduct
f2bs08p3-0004.380-0011.740 are newcomers to the district who are unaware of his political record and conservative blue collar ethnic democrats
f2bs08p3-0011.740-0018.720 who may have tolerated frank homosexuality before but now are disturbed by a male prostitute claim
f2bs08p3-0018.720-0022.190 that he conducted business out of frank washington apartment
f2bs08p6-0000.000-0007.650 several constituents are planning petition drives on frank behalf saying he still can be an effective representative
f2bs08p6-0007.650-0009.600 but some political analysts say
f2bs08p6-0009.600-0012.580 frank credibility in congress is shot
f2bs08p6-0012.580-0022.730 and some democratic insiders afraid of how a prolonged ethics committee investigation might affect the party seem to be increasing the pressure on frank to resign
f2bs08p6-0022.730-0025.450 but frank says no one in the leadership
f2bs08p6-0025.450-0027.480 has asked him to step down

f2bs09p1-0000.000-0005.590 during the past one hundred and fifty years seventy two species in massachusetts have become extinct
f2bs09p1-0005.590-0009.560 initially they were ravaged by hunters later by pollution
f2bs09p1-0009.560-0012.510 and most recently by real estate development
f2bs09p1-0012.510-0017.870 today state biologists consider four hundred and three native plant and animal species
f2bs09p1-0017.870-0021.540 to be of special concern threatened or endangered
f2bs09p1-0021.540-0024.670 only twenty two are protected by federal law
f2bs09p1-0024.670-0029.370 it up to each state to protect other rare species found within its borders
f2bs09p1-0029.370-0033.310 at least thirty states have such laws massachusetts does not
f2bs09p1-0033.310-0038.350 craig mactenel is legislative liaison for the fisheries and wildlife department
f2bs09p2-0000.000-0005.140 the bill would impose heavy fines for killing or selling any of the state rare species
f2bs09p2-0005.140-0012.070 and even stiffer penalties for altering the habitat of threatened or endangered species without a special permit
f2bs09p2-0012.070-0020.750 garon bresnick general counsel of the massachusetts homebuilders association says the effect would be to endanger developable land
f2bs09p2-0020.750-0023.920 he says property owners already have their hands tied
f2bs09p2-0023.920-0026.310 by a state law protecting wetlands
f2bs09p2-0026.310-0030.590 and now the state wants to encroach on building sites that are high and dry
f2bs09p3-0000.000-0010.420 but henry willsey head of the state natural heritage and endangered species program says the measure would affect relatively few acres perhaps only seventy five hundred throughout the state
f2bs09p3-0010.420-0013.210 willsey program has spent the last decade
f2bs09p3-0013.210-0020.420 collecting data on rare species and he knows where they are cape cod and the islands the south shore near plymouth
f2bs09p3-0020.420-0024.370 and parts of the berkshires to name a few critical habitat areas
f2bs09p3-0024.370-0027.860 but willsey says he wo publicize specific sites
f2bs09p3-0027.860-0031.170 until after the endangered species bill becomes law
f2bs09p3-0031.170-0039.080 the issue he says should not be influenced by politics and who owns what property but should be based on biology
f2bs09p4-0000.000-0011.560 critics of the proposed law say the state ca afford it in these financially troubled times but willsey says the bill would be mostly funded by voluntary contributions on state income tax forms
f2bs09p4-0011.560-0016.870 and he says there ten million dollars from bond sales for habitat acquisition on hand
f2bs09p4-0016.870-0019.880 should the state have to buy out some land owners
f2bs09p4-0019.880-0026.530 but developers say land takings under the endangered species bill would be inequitable if not illegal
f2bs09p4-0026.530-0030.260 and the state may be hit with a series of costly lawsuits
f2bs09p4-0030.260-0034.190 the measure price tag will be reviewed by the house ways and means committee
f2bs09p4-0034.190-0038.870 greenfield representative carmen bule a member of the committee and sponsor of the bill
f2bs09p4-0038.870-0041.540 is hoping for timely consideration
f2bs09p5-0000.000-0007.360 if the measure wins the legislature final approval before this session ends it will take at least a year to finalize regulations
f2bs09p5-0007.360-0012.260 and to publicly outline the habitat of the state most endangered species

f2bs10p1-0000.000-0006.710 the contract was unveiled last may after eight months of negotiations and hailed by educators as historic
f2bs10p1-0006.710-0009.740 the pact between the teacher union and the school department
f2bs10p1-0009.740-0014.470 calls for an unprecedented shift of power from central office administrators
f2bs10p1-0014.470-0018.710 to those who know each school best teachers parents and students
f2bs10p1-0018.710-0023.960 it called school based management and boston teachers union president ed dougherty
f2bs10p1-0023.960-0028.390 touts it as essential to turning around the city troubled school system
f2bs10p2-0000.000-0006.920 when the contract was announced boston mayor ray flynn praised the reforms it promises but in the next breath he cautioned
f2bs10p2-0006.920-0011.400 that the city would be hard pressed to pay for the eighty nine million dollar package
f2bs10p2-0011.400-0015.050 since then the city financial outlook has become even gloomier
f2bs10p2-0015.050-0019.980 in an effort to avert today walkout flynn offered to fund a one year contract
f2bs10p2-0019.980-0023.720 but that would require the union to negotiate a whole new agreement
f2bs10p2-0023.720-0026.330 ed dougherty says that impossible
f2bs10p3-0000.000-0012.050 some people blame the dukakis administration for it budget bungling and cuts in local aid others the legislature for its failure to approve new taxes but many teachers and parents blame mayor flynn
f2bs10p3-0012.050-0015.250 saying he should have worked harder on behalf of the contract
f2bs10p3-0015.250-0018.160 instead of politicing for an appointed school committee
f2bs10p3-0018.160-0022.000 some teachers theorize that flynn trying to get back at the union
f2bs10p3-0022.000-0025.680 for having opposed his referendum on school committee restructuring
f2bs10p3-0025.680-0030.740 but dougherty has another theory he says the mayor just does want the contract funded
f2bs10p4-0000.000-0005.460 jeff conley heads the boston finance commission a watchdog agency created by the city charter
f2bs10p5-0000.000-0011.210 the union estimates that at least thirty million dollars are available in unspent money from last year but conley says that amounts to only ten million dollars and several budget items are vying for the funds
f2bs10p5-0011.210-0025.300 the mayor education advisor ellen guiny says it would be irresponsible for flynn to commit to the three year contract given current revenue forecasts but she says those who criticize the mayor for backing down on his commitment to education
f2bs10p5-0025.300-0026.150 are wrong
f2bs10p6-0000.000-0003.300 guiny says the mayor intends to continue to push for new taxes
f2bs10p6-0003.300-0008.090 and perhaps within a month or two the political winds will shift enough in his direction
f2bs10p6-0008.090-0010.880 to allow him to support the teacher contract
f2bs10p6-0010.880-0012.780 the union ed dougherty says
f2bs10p6-0012.780-0017.580 he wo know until after a board meeting next week just how long the union can wait
f2bs10p6-0017.580-0020.200 before calling for a full scale strike

f2bs11p1-0000.000-0008.920 the teen health center at cambridge ringe and latin is visited about one thousand times each month by students seeking everything from aspirin to immunizations
f2bs11p1-0008.920-0010.270 to prenatal care
f2bs11p1-0010.270-0013.780 within a few weeks condoms will be added to the list
f2bs11p1-0013.780-0016.690 it has been determined exactly who will dispense them
f2bs11p1-0016.690-0030.880 or how many a student will be allowed to buy at one time but health center director lynn choafe says these things are certain only latex condoms with spermicide the most effective at preventing transmission of the aids virus will be available
f2bs11p1-0030.880-0034.650 and choafe says students will be required to undergo counseling
f2bs11p1-0034.650-0037.620 the first time they come to the clinic for condoms
f2bs11p2-0000.000-0006.550 a survey last spring indicated that fifty one percent of ringe and latin students have had sexual intercourse
f2bs11p2-0006.550-0014.900 when asked what contraceptives were used the last time they had sex nearly half said condoms another twenty five percent said none
f2bs11p2-0014.900-0023.690 while the survey showed wide awareness of aids many students say it too embarassing or inconvenient to stock up on condoms at the corner drug store
f2bs11p2-0023.690-0031.570 there are no reported cases of hiv infection at the school but senior matt aldridge is worried about what the future may bring
f2bs11p4-0000.000-0006.020 but senior emily case says if the school committee tinkers with the policy her aids peer leadership group
f2bs11p4-0006.020-0009.120 may be forced to resume condom distribution
f2bs11p5-0000.000-0006.560 assuming the teen health center program gets off the ground case says shell refer her former customers to the clinic
f2bs11p5-0006.560-0012.770 but if someone afraid to talk to adults case says she wo let that student walk away empty handed
f2bs11p5-0012.770-0015.770 for wbur im margo melnicove
f2bs12p1-0000.000-0007.900 if the beginning of our interview was any indication julie ballaga reputation as an enthusiastic accessible person is well deserved
f2bs12p1-0007.900-0014.970 her corner office in boston has a fine view of the charles river but a poor background for recording due to a noisy heating system
f2bs12p1-0014.970-0019.720 instead of asking an aide to find us a quiet office ballaga lead the search
f2bs12p4-0000.000-0011.820 fifty nine year old ballaga first got involved in environmental issues as a town planning and zoning commissioner then as a member of the connecticut house of representatives where she spent much of her ten year stint on the environment committee
f2bs12p4-0011.820-0016.990 she insists her husband work as an oil company executive never colored her thinking
f2bs12p4-0016.990-0019.390 ballaga says in fact she taught him
f2bs12p4-0019.390-0021.010 the environmental way
f2bs12p4-0021.010-0026.850 she carried her message statewide in nineteen eighty six as connecticut republican candidate for governor
f2bs12p4-0026.850-0029.000 against incumbent william oneil
f2bs12p5-0000.000-0004.040 oneil trounced ballaga but she says she has no regrets about having run
f2bs12p5-0004.040-0010.350 apparently her politicing over the years has been effective it difficult to find a ballaga enemy
f2bs12p5-0010.350-0017.950 wanda ricurbee now with connecticut environmental protection department was an environmental lobbyist when ballaga was a legislator
f2bs12p6-0000.000-0006.520 head of governmental affairs for the hartford chamber of commerce joseph ierna is another longtime ballaga observer
f2bs12p7-0000.000-0007.310 massachusetts water resources authority director paul levy says ballaga is sincerely committed to pro-environment goals
f2bs12p7-0007.310-0009.310 her predecessor michael deland
f2bs12p7-0009.310-0011.380 started the clean-up of boston harbor
f2bs12p7-0011.380-0015.260 levy is confident ballaga will keep the project on track
f2bs12p8-0000.000-0003.690 ballaga has already passed two tests according to conservationists
f2bs12p8-0003.690-0008.630 she pressed for washington recent rejection of a proposed dam on rhode island big river
f2bs12p8-0008.630-0013.380 and insisted on another review of expansion plans for the loon mountain ski area
f2bs12p8-0013.380-0016.070 both positions were crafted by deland
f2bs12p8-0016.070-0020.020 and ballaga seems determined to stay the environmental course
f2bs12p8-0020.020-0023.840 but some observers who say president reagan hands off style
f2bs12p8-0023.840-0030.000 allowed deland plenty of room to flex environmental muscle wonder if ballaga will fare as well
f2bs12p8-0030.000-0032.470 under the hands on bush administration
f2bs12p8-0032.470-0034.590 ballaga says she not worried
f2bs12p8-0034.590-0041.260 and denies speculation that chief of staff john sununu is meddling in the region environmental affairs
f2bs12p9-0000.000-0003.460 if he calls ballaga says shell give sununu a fair hearing
f2bs12p9-0003.460-0005.260 just like everyone else

f2bs13p1-0000.000-0005.580 a decade ago there were three reported aids cases in massachusetts now there are three thousand
f2bs13p1-0005.580-0010.880 and it estimated that every day six more baystaters become infected with the aids virus
f2bs13p1-0010.880-0019.100 in the first three months of nineteen ninety alone human services secretary phillip johnston says two hundred and thirty one men women and children
f2bs13p1-0019.100-0021.970 were diagnosed as having full blown aids
f2bs13p2-0000.000-0006.090 johnston says one change that would help curb the epidemic would be legislative support for higher taxes
f2bs13p2-0006.090-0014.200 without additional revenues johnston says the public health department twenty million dollar aids prevention programs wo reach enough people
f2bs13p2-0014.200-0024.130 and while he applauded president bush recent remarks underscoring the seriousness of the aids epidemic johnston says attitudes at the white house must also change
f2bs13p3-0000.000-0007.970 when asked whether any changes are needed in his office johnston says he may re-evaluate a prohibition against condoms in state prisons
f2bs13p3-0007.970-0010.570 even though sex among inmates is illegal
f2bs13p3-0010.570-0013.310 johnston says given prison overcrowding
f2bs13p3-0013.310-0021.680 and the fact that fifteen percent of inmates who volunteered to be tested are infected with the aids virus the policy deserves a second look
f2bs13p3-0021.680-0030.620 but when asked if the state should reconsider its policy against giving sterile needles to i-v drug users public health commissioner david mulligan says no
f2bs13p3-0030.620-0035.490 treatment says mulligan is the key to stemming the spread of aids among addicts
f2bs13p4-0000.000-0009.310 but aids action committee director larry kesler says more aggressive policies and much more money are needed on all fronts from federal agencies to cities and towns
f2bs13p4-0009.310-0015.050 the greater boston area says kesler used to rank eighth among major cities for incidence of aids
f2bs13p4-0015.050-0021.620 but kesler says other cities with few prevention programs have moved up on the list and boston is now thirteenth
f2bs13p5-0000.000-0005.610 kesler says it will take an additional fifteen million dollars in state aids prevention funds next year
f2bs13p5-0005.610-0007.510 to get that message across
f2bs13p5-0007.510-0010.360 for wbur im margo melnicove
f2bs14p1-0000.000-0008.400 scott harshbarger is no stranger to party infighting he challenged a democratic incumbent in an unsuccessful bid for district attorney in nineteen seventy eight
f2bs14p1-0008.400-0010.840 then again in eighty two when he won the seat
f2bs14p1-0010.840-0017.080 apparently the former harvard football player is a quitter but he and james shannon have so much in common
f2bs14p1-0017.080-0022.670 that many observers wonder why harshbarger wants to upset the democratic applecart this time around
f2bs14p1-0022.670-0028.410 both candidates are young both reflect the party liberal leanings and support abortion rights
f2bs14p1-0028.410-0032.760 but harshbarger with twenty years experience in criminal and civil courts
f2bs14p1-0032.760-0036.480 says he more qualified to be the state top lawyer than shannon
f2bs14p1-0036.480-0039.670 who was a congressman before he was elected attorney general
f2bs14p2-0000.000-0006.800 as an example the two term district attorney cites what he calls the criminal justice system state of total crisis
f2bs14p3-0000.000-0001.710 attorney general james shannon
f2bs14p4-0000.000-0005.080 shannon prides himself on having created a narcotics unit and a public integrity division
f2bs14p4-0005.080-0009.960 which are waging aggressive wars he says against drugs and political corruption
f2bs14p4-0009.960-0013.840 shannon best known however for his anti-seabrook crusade
f2bs14p4-0013.840-0016.750 that battle actually began under harshbarger
f2bs14p4-0016.750-0020.430 who filed the state first brief in the seabrook power plant case
f2bs14p4-0020.430-0023.450 as an assistant attorney general some fifteen years ago
f2bs14p4-0023.450-0029.300 shannon says it his job to continue the fight but harshbarger says shannon taken it too far
f2bs14p4-0029.300-0033.770 because he more preoccupied with the news headlines than with the legal merits
f2bs14p5-0000.000-0007.390 harshbarger may have a point says pollster jerry travinsky but it not compelling enough to convince voters to unseat an incumbent
f2bs14p5-0007.390-0011.950 nor says travinsky is harshbarger claim that he the more qualified candidate
f2bs14p6-0000.000-0008.770 travinsky says another problem for harshbarger is that he and shannon are cut from the same ideological cloth providing little reason for people to switch their votes
f2bs14p6-0008.770-0013.380 in fact it difficult to tell the candidates apart when they talk about the issues
f2bs14p7-0000.000-0012.520 scott harshbarger says he confident hell win enough convention delegates to secure a place on the primary ballot so between now and september election harshbarger says hell put all his resources into distinguishing himself

f2bs16p1-0000.000-0004.330 boston phoenix reporter rick kahn says top city hall and police officials
f2bs16p1-0004.330-0010.370 are engaged in a deadly game of denial giving the public the impression that boston gang problem
f2bs16p1-0010.370-0013.680 is confined to a few hundred inner-city kids
f2bs16p1-0013.680-0016.920 but kahn says his police and street sources
f2bs16p1-0016.920-0022.160 say there are four to six thousand boston gang members ages nine to thirty five
f2bs16p1-0022.160-0026.250 who are competing for turf and for profits from illicit drug deals
f2bs16p1-0026.250-0028.550 across the city and beyond
f2bs16p2-0000.000-0009.290 kahn says gangs use the latest communications devices beepers car phones portable police scanners and the like to stay at least one step ahead of the cops
f2bs16p2-0009.290-0016.540 he says five gangs have joined forces in a mega-merger giving them more bang as well as more drugs and guns for the buck
f2bs16p2-0016.540-0020.260 and he says there are about ten up and coming girl gangs
f2bs16p3-0000.000-0005.310 boston police deputy superintendent william selester is in charge of the mattapan roxbury area
f2bs16p3-0005.310-0009.560 selester says once there were two girl gangs with thirteen members each
f2bs16p3-0009.560-0010.940 but they did last

f2bs16p3-0014.510-0016.590 because gangs ca get along
f2bs16p3-0016.590-0022.320 and he says youd have to count as he puts it every pain in the neck group that drinks beer on a street corner
f2bs16p3-0022.320-0025.630 for gang membership to approach four to six thousand
f2bs16p3-0025.630-0030.450 selester says at most there are only six hundred real gang members in the city
f2bs16p3-0030.450-0034.360 and of those only two hundred are hard core violent criminals
f2bs16p3-0034.360-0038.870 he dismisses claims by the phoenix that police downplay the situation
f2bs16p3-0038.870-0042.070 the media says selester overstate the problem
f2bs16p3-0042.070-0046.030 and most ignore his plea not to publicize gangs names
f2bs16p3-0046.030-0051.560 selester says such publicity encourages gang members by feeding their hunger for status
f2bs16p3-0051.560-0054.870 still selester says his forces are making headway
f2bs16p4-0000.000-0005.580 diane wilkerson is legal counsel for the n double a c p boston branch and an inner-city resident
f2bs16p4-0005.580-0011.670 in the past wilkerson has agreed with selester and others who fault the media for glorifying gangs
f2bs16p4-0011.670-0016.050 but wilkerson says the main reason she distrusts the media and the police
f2bs16p4-0016.050-0018.800 is that neither have been telling it like it is
f2bs16p4-0018.800-0022.550 the phoenix report on gangs incorporated says wilkerson
f2bs16p4-0022.550-0024.190 is a welcome change
f2bs16p5-0000.000-0004.000 wilkerson says it no wonder that youngsters without real alternatives
f2bs16p5-0004.000-0007.350 find the lure of big drug profits hard to resist
f2bs16p5-0007.350-0013.060 and she says the news that this temptation is not limited to any particular race or neighborhood
f2bs16p5-0013.060-0015.620 also comes as no surprise

f2bs17p4-0029.380-0032.630 he also lost his job apartment and girlfriend
f2bs17p4-0032.630-0036.650 but farrow says now he realizes two wrongs do make a right
f2bs17p4-0036.650-0040.030 and he says perhaps his pain spared someone else

f2bs18p3-0000.000-0004.490 it nothing new for reservation children who attend boarding schools to feel torn
f2bs18p3-0004.490-0015.300 but there no comparison between today prep schools says northfield mount herman advisor for native american students tom sorcee and the old missionary and government run boarding schools
f2bs18p3-0015.300-0018.470 where children were beaten for speaking native languages
f2bs18p3-0018.470-0021.840 and the goal was to christianize or americanize them
f2bs18p3-0021.840-0025.610 sorcee says his goal is to provide a home away from home
f2bs18p3-0025.610-0027.540 and apparently he succeeding
f2bs18p3-0027.540-0033.370 sorcee says during the five years he and his wife who is navajo have been at northfield mount herman
f2bs18p3-0033.370-0038.920 the student body included about a dozen native americans each year and only one has dropped out
f2bs18p4-0000.000-0004.470 the network is growing as more and more prep schools recruit native american students
f2bs18p4-0004.470-0011.840 doctor joseph curry headmaster at cushing academy in ashburnham massachusetts is greatly responsible for the trend

f2bs18p5-0005.090-0009.520 meanwhile cushing academy sponsors a six week junior high summer school there

f2bs18p5-0016.440-0021.840 enrollment has grown from fifty students in nineteen eighty eight to more than three hundred this summer
f2bs18p5-0021.840-0030.820 curry says many native american families thrilled to see their children turned on by school for a change now want to enroll them in prep school year-round

f2bs18p8-0000.000-0000.600 translation
f2bs19p1-0000.000-0010.370 lincoln reputation as a town with a social conscience arises primarily from two traditions a commitment to land conservation that predates the environmental movement by several decades
f2bs19p1-0010.370-0012.160 and a commitment to education
f2bs19p1-0012.160-0018.970 lincoln voters who tend to be highly educated themselves have approved a series of proposition two-and-a-half overrides
f2bs19p1-0018.970-0022.720 and spend more per pupil than most massachusetts communities
f2bs19p1-0022.720-0028.700 the town has shared its riches with black youngsters from boston since metco inception twenty five years ago
f2bs19p1-0028.700-0035.070 and each year since nineteen seventy five lincoln metco enrollment has comprised twenty percent of the student body
f2bs19p1-0035.070-0040.080 but no town an island not even lincoln says school committee chairman henry morgan
f2bs19p2-0000.000-0009.710 morgan stopped short of saying racism may underlie recent complaints about metco preferring instead to say that some people may be insensitive to the implications of race
f2bs19p2-0009.710-0013.320 morgan not the only lincolnite who choosing words carefully
f2bs19p2-0013.320-0019.700 irene rice says it as if metco a sacred cow which few lincoln parents have dared to question publicly
f2bs19p3-0000.000-0004.480 one of rice complaints is that teachers failed to recognize her son learning disability
f2bs19p3-0004.480-0007.580 apparently because they were preoccupied with other children
f2bs19p3-0007.580-0015.600 rice points out that while metco youngsters comprise one-fifth of the students they require nearly half of the individual education plants
f2bs19p3-0015.600-0019.690 other lincoln parents worry that the schools are losing their academic edge
f2bs19p3-0019.690-0025.300 tracking students according to ability is frowned upon by lincoln teachers and school administrators
f2bs19p3-0025.300-0028.390 because it been shown to discriminate against minorities
f2bs19p3-0028.390-0033.570 but school committee member jennifer donaldson wonders if the system anti-tracking philosophy
f2bs19p3-0033.570-0037.430 shortchanges some students for the sake of their metco classmates
f2bs19p4-0000.000-0003.680 but donaldson says what may have forced most metco critics out of the closet
f2bs19p4-0003.680-0006.050 is the statewide economics squeeze
f2bs19p4-0006.050-0011.600 the state reimburses lincoln for metco related costs but those funds face a five percent cut
f2bs19p4-0011.600-0016.630 meanwhile lincoln enrollment is rising requiring two more classrooms next year
f2bs19p4-0016.630-0020.530 that expense and others could be avoided some taxpayers say
f2bs19p4-0020.530-0022.220 by downsizing metco
f2bs19p4-0022.220-0025.900 estimates vary widely on how much money could be saved
f2bs19p4-0025.900-0031.480 but no matter what the cost school committee member mickey lipsey says you ca put a price on the value
f2bs19p4-0031.480-0033.710 of well- integrated classrooms

f2bs20p1-0018.230-0020.630 he then blamed the crime on a black man
f2bs20p1-0020.630-0023.530 in an effort to ease the racial tensions that erupted

f2bs20p4-0000.000-0003.050 but first the trustees will review scholarship candidates
f2bs20p4-0003.050-0006.870 more than one hundred applications have been distributed in just two weeks
f2bs20p4-0006.870-0009.530 dimaiti says awards will be made in august

f2bs20p4-0020.040-0023.710 the fund now totals nearly five hundred thousand dollars
f2bs20p4-0023.710-0026.770 but carl dimaiti says another half a million is needed
f2bs20p4-0026.770-0029.070 for the carol dimaiti stuart foundation

f2bs29p2-0009.640-0018.300 the treaty on the agenda for this weekend world summit for children at the un palacios says he received informal word from the white house
f2bs29p2-0018.300-0024.780 that the president will sign the document sunday but it unclear if bush will push hard for senate ratification
f2bs29p2-0024.780-0030.560 calling the treaty the magna carta for children palacios says speedy approval is critical
f2bs29p2-0030.560-0037.330 he admits the treaty alone wo change children lives but says it can change attitudes and policies
f2bs29p2-0037.330-0039.730 about children needs and rights
f2bs29p3-0000.000-0003.420 palacios says the treaty also can add muscle to the argument
f2bs29p3-0003.420-0009.970 that governments must re-arrange priorities and resources to put children first not last on the list
f2bs29p3-0009.970-0015.270 tufts university president jean meyere makes that point with his own statistics
f2bs29p4-0000.000-0004.290 meyere says every chief of state will profess his or her love for children
f2bs29p4-0004.290-0008.390 but their budgets primarily reflect a love affair with the arms race
f2bs29p4-0008.390-0013.810 according to unicef twenty thousand of the forty thousand children who die each day
f2bs29p4-0013.810-0018.120 could be saved by expanding immunization and nutrition programs
f2bs29p4-0018.120-0021.080 at a cost of two and a half billion dollars a year
f2bs29p4-0021.080-0026.350 the same amount says unicef that the worlds nations spend on weapons each day
f2bs29p4-0026.350-0029.460 for wbur im margo melnicove
f2bs30p1-0000.000-0005.490 in nineteen seventy four jim grilsh was a healthy father of two working for boston edison
f2bs30p1-0005.490-0010.650 when suddenly at the age of thirty seven he lost his hearing overnight
f2bs30p1-0010.650-0013.250 to this day doctors do know why
f2bs30p1-0013.250-0017.880 like other late deafened adults grilsh loss isolated him
f2bs30p1-0017.880-0023.860 he does identify with people who are born deaf who have created their own community and language
f2bs30p1-0023.860-0027.110 grilsh says he a product of the hearing world
f2bs30p1-0027.110-0030.810 and it frustrating to no longer be able to participate fully
f2bs30p1-0030.810-0035.220 grilsh has learned sign language because everyone he knows can hear
f2bs30p1-0035.220-0042.460 he tries to read lips which is difficult at best and has his family and friends communicate with him in writing
f2bs31p1-0000.000-0006.500 police say elizabeth levy was driving fifty miles an hour in a thirty mile zone around midnight on july fifteenth
f2bs31p1-0006.500-0008.360 when she lost control of her car
f2bs31p1-0008.360-0011.030 she hit a parked auto then a utility pole
f2bs31p1-0011.030-0015.080 police also say levy blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit
f2bs31p1-0015.080-0017.600 it was her second drunk driving arrest
f2bs31p1-0017.600-0023.210 levy was eight and a half months pregnant at the time of the accident the next day her baby was stillborn
f2bs31p1-0023.210-0026.000 middlesex county district attorney scott harshbarger
f2bs31p1-0026.000-0028.720 says state law and the facts of the case
f2bs31p1-0028.720-0033.010 give him no choice but to prosecute levy for motor vehicle homicide
f2bs31p2-0000.000-0004.760 but some critics say harshbarger may be throwing the book at levy for political reasons
f2bs31p2-0004.760-0009.320 they suggest that harshbarger who running for state attorney general in nineteen ninety
f2bs31p2-0009.320-0013.590 and who known as an abortion rights advocate may be pursuing the case
f2bs31p2-0013.590-0016.860 to curry the favor of voters who support fetal rights
f2bs31p2-0016.860-0022.250 but harshbarger says the case has nothing to do with abortion or his political ambitions
f2bs31p2-0022.250-0029.650 the massachusetts supreme court has ruled that if a fetus is viable it considered a person under the motor vehicle homicide law
f2bs31p2-0029.650-0034.270 and harshbarger says anyone who kills a viable fetus by driving drunk
f2bs31p2-0034.270-0035.770 ought to be prosecuted
f2bs31p2-0035.770-0041.980 levy is not commenting but her attorney nancy gertner says the homicide charge is absurd
f2bs31p3-0000.000-0007.350 gertner says the state supreme court ruling involved the case of a third party whose car hit a pregnant pedestrian killing her fetus
f2bs31p3-0007.350-0013.300 but according to gertner the high court said nothing about prosecuting a woman for harming her own fetus
f2bs31p3-0013.300-0020.300 it may be appropriate to charge levy with drunk driving says gertner but it unconstitutional to also charge her
f2bs31p3-0020.300-0022.510 with killing part of her own body
f2bs31p4-0000.000-0003.340 director of the massachusetts civil liberties union john roberts
f2bs31p4-0003.340-0006.560 wants harshbarger to drop the homicide charge against levy
f2bs31p4-0006.560-0014.130 the case is part of an alarming trend he says to pit so-called fetal rights against women rights to privacy and autonomy
f2bs31p5-0000.000-0001.250 but harshbarger says
f2bs31p5-0001.250-0005.580 there no threat that pregnant women will be prosecuted for legal conduct
f2bs31p5-0005.580-0008.000 even if harm to a fetus results
f2bs31p5-0008.000-0013.250 marian stokes agrees saying that after all drunk driving is against the law
f2bs31p5-0013.250-0025.230 the co-founder of the greater boston chapter of mothers against drunk driving says she empathizes with the pain elizabeth levy must be feeling over her loss but she says that no reason to treat levy differently
f2bs31p5-0025.230-0028.040 than the drunk driver who killed stokes son
f2bs31p6-0000.000-0006.650 if the motor vehicle homicide charge sticks and levy is convicted she faces one to fifteen years in prison
f2bs31p6-0006.650-0009.510 for wbur im margo melnicove
f2bs32p1-0000.000-0012.960 at a candidate forum last august and in a subsequent meeting with environmental activists john silber suggested there no need to completely rule out further development on wetlands because beavers can always create new habitat
f2bs32p1-0012.960-0015.130 later silber said he was joking
f2bs32p1-0015.130-0024.150 environmentalists recalling the beaver remark and a description once coined by silber of boston university english department now have a joke of their own
f2bs32p1-0024.150-0026.970 what do you call a beaver who builds her dwelling
f2bs32p1-0026.970-0028.830 a dam matriarch
f2bs32p1-0028.830-0041.340 but silber environmental platform is no laughing matter says caroline simmons director of the massachusetts association of conservation commissions her voice muffled by a bucktoothed beaver mask
f2bs32p2-0000.000-0008.320 dressed as beulah beaver simmons appeared at yesterday endorsement of republican william weld by the sierra club and the league of environmental voters
f2bs32p2-0008.320-0012.060 weld supporters touted several environmental protection cases
f2bs32p2-0012.060-0014.430 championed by the former us attorney
f2bs32p2-0014.430-0018.710 they also compared weld environmental promises if he elected governor
f2bs32p2-0018.710-0024.100 with john silber weld supports stricter auto emission standards than national norms
f2bs32p2-0024.100-0026.900 silber thinks federal standards should prevail
f2bs32p2-0026.900-0029.670 or else businesses may be driven from the state
f2bs32p2-0029.670-0035.640 weld applauds mandatory recycling silber dismisses recycling goals as meaningless
f2bs32p2-0035.640-0051.970 weld supports construction of a secondary treatment plant for boston harbor silber thinks there may be a less expensive but just as effective alternative priscilla chapman director of the sierra club new england chapter says environmentally minded voters have a clear choice
f2bs32p3-0000.000-0001.820 another sierra club spokeswoman
f2bs32p3-0001.820-0008.440 says weld will listen to both sides of the story before making a judgment but she does get that feeling from silber
f2bs32p3-0008.440-0014.750 but while weld may be long on people skills he may be short on money to implement his proposals
f2bs32p3-0014.750-0022.210 weld supports the clt tax roll back petition unlike those who endorsed him yesterday who are working to defeat question three
f2bs32p3-0022.210-0028.010 but even if the roll back passes they still say theyd rather see weld in the corner office than silber
f2bs32p3-0028.010-0033.180 when told of the endorsement silber said environmentalists picked the wrong man
f2bs32p4-0000.000-0006.850 several prominent democrats in the environmental movement including former us senator paul tsongas who are backing silber agree
f2bs32p4-0006.850-0021.090 attorney douglas mcdonald a specialist in environmental law says silber got his vote because of his anti-clt stance mcdonald also appreciates what he calls silber environmental pragmatism and says the quote
f2bs32p4-0021.090-0023.250 beaver thing was unfortunate
f2bs32p5-0000.000-0003.520 but weld endorsers say silber involved in a masquerade
f2bs32p5-0003.520-0012.720 being against clt they say does automatically make silber pro-environment they say the only true environmentalist in the gubernatorial race
f2bs32p5-0012.720-0014.010 is william weld

f2bs33p1-0000.000-0004.490 like many rockport residents martha woodworth is furious with the smithsonian
f2bs33p1-0004.490-0012.770 woodworth an astrologer and psychic says she has been in touch with frans denghausen a longtime rockport artist who died three years ago
f2bs33p1-0012.770-0015.820 but she certain denghausen would be furious too
f2bs33p1-0015.820-0028.920 at issue is a codicil to his will bequeathing one million dollars to rockport to replace it obsolete public library provided the town contributes land for a new building or funds to renovate an existing structure
f2bs33p1-0028.920-0033.100 the smithsonian the beneficiary of the bulk of denghausen estate
f2bs33p1-0033.100-0040.540 claims the bequest can be used only for library operating costs once rockport uses it own money for capital improvements
f2bs33p1-0040.540-0046.910 if rockport does not inherit the million dollars the smithsonian as residual beneficiary will
f2bs33p1-0046.910-0063.860 admittedly the codicil is confusing but denghausen friend and former library trustee anne fisk says in several conversations before his untimely death denghausen indicated he wanted the money to be spent on converting a now closed school into the new library
f2bs33p2-0000.000-0010.120 town officials say given that rockport already heavily in debt to pay for a new school complex there no new library in sight unless denghausen money can be used for construction
f2bs33p2-0010.120-0019.830 the present library opened in nineteen oh six director steven rask apologizes for piles of books on the floor saying there no more room on the shelves
f2bs33p2-0019.830-0029.770 if allowed to move to the former school house rask says the library could accommodate nearly three times as many volumes an expanded children room a community meeting hall
f2bs33p2-0029.770-0032.280 and a reading room named after its benefactor
f2bs33p2-0032.280-0038.060 now there no place to read says rask except for a few chairs squeezed into corners
f2bs33p3-0000.000-0005.180 smithsonian spokesperson madeleine jacobs insists the institution not being greedy
f2bs33p3-0005.180-0011.730 the smithsonian already inherited nearly four million dollars from mrs denghausen who died a year before her husband
f2bs33p3-0011.730-0016.090 it due four to five million more once mister denghausen estate is settled
f2bs33p3-0016.090-0024.460 being entrusted with most of the couple fortune says jacobs gives the smithsonian a responsibility to ensure that none of it misspent
f2bs33p4-0000.000-0007.710 rockport residents find that argument especially galling saying to the smithsonian denghausen nothing more than a generous stranger
f2bs33p4-0007.710-0014.130 the case will be heard in essex probate court august fifteenth meanwhile several of rockport well connected citizens
f2bs33p4-0014.130-0019.820 are cancelling their smithsonian memberships and lobbying politicians to throw their weight behind the town
f2bs33p4-0019.820-0025.810 if rockport prevails the smithsonian jacobs says the institution likely to let the matter
f2bs33p4-0025.810-0027.010 rest in peace

f2bs34p1-0000.000-0007.370 wakefield businessman raymond marshall says his property on the edge of grafton is an ideal location for the asbestos conversion plant
f2bs34p1-0007.370-0017.720 marshall says it would take about ten million dollars to equip the building for glass making with six furnaces operating round the clock to melt down truckloads of asbestos waste each day
f2bs34p1-0017.720-0025.950 marshall says the venture would be good for grafton asbestos haulers would pay a fee for disposal and marshall agreed to give ten percent to the town
f2bs34p1-0025.950-0032.360 which he says could amount to more than three million dollars annually nearly one third of grafton total budget
f2bs34p1-0032.360-0038.150 the operation would also be good for marshall profit margin although he refuses to be specific
f2bs34p1-0038.150-0043.140 and marshall says it would be good for the environment to have cancer causing asbestos fibers
f2bs34p1-0043.140-0044.930 removed from it forever
f2bs34p2-0000.000-0008.820 once converted from asbestos into a low quality dark colored glass marshall says the material could be used as a gravel replacement which when mixed with asphalt
f2bs34p2-0008.820-0011.470 provides a road surface with superior grip
f2bs34p2-0011.470-0016.910 if there are no takers marshall says the glass pellets would merely become non-toxic landfill
f2bs34p2-0016.910-0029.170 but university of lowell occupational health professor raphael maurri says once asbestos is removed from a building then wetted and bagged according to government regulations it no longer dangerous
f2bs34p2-0029.170-0033.040 maurri says it makes no sense to disturb the material again
f2bs34p2-0033.040-0034.680 for the sake of recycling
f2bs34p3-0000.000-0002.740 grafton residents say theyre worried about what could happen
f2bs34p3-0002.740-0005.290 even before the material gets to the plant
f2bs34p3-0005.290-0009.730 en route asbestos filled trucks would have to drive through residential areas
f2bs34p3-0009.730-0016.280 only one accident says the town public health nurse could subject countless homes to an asbestos shower
f2bs34p3-0016.280-0025.420 town planner peter lowett says more research is needed to determine if that fear is well-founded meanwhile he says town officials will not rubber-stamp the project
f2bs34p3-0025.420-0030.010 even though grafton could certainly use the millions of dollars it been promised
f2bs34p4-0000.000-0002.540 beyond town zoning and public health board review
f2bs34p4-0002.540-0006.060 a state environmental impact report is likely to be required
f2bs34p4-0006.060-0012.640 developer raymond marshall says if the permitting process drags on hell take his business out of state

f2btrlp1-0005.290-0011.390 and many seldom use birth control according to a recent lewis harris poll sponsored by planned parenthood
f2btrlp1-0011.390-0014.790 advocates of dispensing contraceptives in schools
f2btrlp1-0014.790-0021.190 see the poll as supporting their case others say easier availability of birth control for teenagers
f2btrlp1-0021.190-0024.380 will make an alarming situation much worse
f2btrlp1-0024.380-0028.950 the issue has already stirred heated debate in boston where it bound to surface again
f2btrlp1-0028.950-0035.170 next month the superintendent of boston public schools is expected to put thumbs up or thumbs down
f2btrlp1-0035.170-0040.090 on a proposal to establish school based health clinics that would among other things
f2btrlp1-0040.090-0042.500 dispense birth control devices
f2btrlp1-0042.500-0045.570 wbur margo melnicove reports
f2btrlp2-0000.000-0007.880 if present trends continue this year in massachusetts approximately fourteen thousand teenagers will become pregnant
f2btrlp2-0007.880-0013.410 three of them are these students at saint margarets hospital alternative school for pregnant teens
f2btrlp2-0013.410-0016.310 they are sixteen or seventeen years old
f2btrlp2-0016.310-0019.110 two are from boston one is from out of town

f2btrlp3-0003.140-0017.530 she and the father of her child are married and are planning for the future and even though she been sexually active since she was twelve she avoided unwanted pregnancies by using birth control pills that her mother helped her get at a local hospital
f2btrlp3-0017.530-0021.590 these three young woman like the idea of school based health clinics
f2btrlp3-0021.590-0027.390 if one had existed in their schools they say they would have used it for someone to talk to about sex
f2btrlp3-0027.390-0030.120 and for a safe place to get birth control
f2btrlp3-0030.120-0035.390 a pilot project to set up such clinics in two to four boston middle and high schools
f2btrlp3-0035.390-0039.980 was proposed last spring by the boston student human services collaborative
f2btrlp3-0039.980-0046.080 the plan was endorsed last fall by the adolescent issues task force set up by the superintendent of schools
f2btrlp3-0046.080-0055.220 task force member mary conroy who directs family life education at saint margarets was one of a few dissenting votes against the endorsement
f2btrlp4-0000.000-0013.160 these claims are disputed by the head of the task force doctor deborah prothro-stith she says since students do use existing services school based clinics would be an alternative rather than a duplication
f2btrlp4-0013.160-0020.780 and she says like health care in the work place the thrust of health care in the schools is to overcome access barriers
f2btrlp5-0000.000-0014.690 kids do have sex because contraceptives are or are not available according to prothro-stith and while she does not condone sexual activity among teens she thinks medically it unfair to deny access to contraceptives to some
f2btrlp5-0014.690-0019.700 because others object to their availability in schools on religious grounds
f2btrlp6-0000.000-0013.490 prothro-stith points out that if school based clinics were established parental permission would be required for students to receive each service offered and that birth control would be only part of a comprehensive program
f2btrlp6-0013.490-0018.570 dealing with other adolescent issues like depression suicide and eating disorders
f2btrlp6-0018.570-0020.780 she agrees with mary conroy
f2btrlp6-0020.780-0024.280 that the roots of these problems dig deep into society
f2btrlp6-0024.280-0039.670 but while conroy strongly opposes school based clinics as a solution calling them a bandaid that wo work prothro-stith says both attention to teenagers immediate needs as well as long range prevention and health education are needed
f2btrlp7-0000.000-0010.330 problems associated with the proposal to set up health clinics in schools are also expected to multiply if superintendent of schools laval wilson goes along with the idea next month
f2btrlp7-0010.330-0014.000 the boston school committee religious and community leaders

f2btrop3-0042.300-0044.550 by the adolescent issues task force

f2btrop3-0047.030-0055.500 task force member mary conroy who directs family life education at saint margarets was one of a few dissenting votes against the endorsement
f2btrop4-0000.000-0012.890 these claims are disputed by the head of the task force doctor deborah prothro-stith she says since students do use existing services school based clinics would be an alternative rather than a duplication
f2btrop4-0012.890-0017.880 and she says like health care in the work place the thrust of health care in the schools
f2btrop4-0017.880-0020.550 is to overcome access barriers
f2btrop5-0000.000-0004.840 kids do have sex because contraceptives are or are not available
f2btrop5-0004.840-0015.590 according to prothro-stith and while she does not condone sexual activity among teens she thinks medically it unfair to deny access to contraceptives to some
f2btrop5-0015.590-0020.290 because others object to their availability in schools on religious grounds
f2btrop6-0000.000-0011.830 prothro-stith points out that if school based clinics were established parental permission would be required for students to receive each service offered and that birth control would be only part of a comprehensive program
f2btrop6-0011.830-0016.700 dealing with other adolescent issues like depression suicide and eating disorders
f2btrop6-0016.700-0020.080 she agrees with mary conroy that the roots of these problems
f2btrop6-0020.080-0021.690 dig deep into society
f2btrop6-0021.690-0032.790 but while conroy strongly opposes school based clinics as a solution calling them a bandaid that wo work prothro-stith says both attention to teenagers immediate needs
f2btrop6-0032.790-0036.620 as well as long range prevention and health education are needed

f3ajrlp1-0000.000-0012.080 wanted chief justice of the massachusetts supreme court in april the sjc current leader edward hennessy reaches the mandatory retirement age of seventy and a successor is expected to be named in march
f3ajrlp1-0012.080-0019.300 it may be the most important appointment governor michael dukakis makes during the remainder of his administration and one of the toughest
f3ajrlp1-0019.300-0024.100 as wbur margo melnicove reports hennessy will be a hard act to follow
f3ajrlp3-0000.000-0008.120 the author of more than eight hundred state supreme court opinions hennessy is widely respected for his legal scholarship and his administrative abilities
f3ajrlp3-0008.120-0021.450 admirers give hennessy much of the credit for sweeping court reform that began a decade ago and for last year legislative approval of thirty-five new judgeships and three hundred million dollars to restore crumbling court houses
f3ajrlp3-0021.450-0029.953 despite the state massive budget deficit hennessy recently urged colleagues in the bar association not to retreat from these hard won gains
f3ajrlp4-0000.000-0009.598 hennessy is the sjc thirty-second chief justice holding the court system on the course he has set and plotting it future agenda wo be an easy job for his successor
f3ajrlp5-0000.000-0008.440 attorney haskel kassler chairs the judicial nominating council eighteen attorneys and laypeople charged with screening applicants for vacancies on the bench
f3ajrlp5-0008.440-0015.050 usually the jnc refers three nominees to the governor his top choice is rated by bar associations
f3ajrlp5-0015.050-0017.550 and grilled by the governor executive council
f3ajrlp5-0017.550-0025.493 kassler says unlike the federal supreme court there no litmus test on particular issues that massachusetts high court nominees must pass
f3ajrlp6-0000.000-0008.450 all but one of the chief justices since eighteen ninety-nine when oliver wendell holmes was appointed came from the ranks of sjc associateaj justices
f3ajrlp6-0008.450-0013.710 if he sticks with tradition dukakis is likely to elevate one of his appointees to chief
f3ajrlp6-0013.710-0017.570 that means paul leocos or ruth abrams the only woman on the court
f3ajrlp6-0017.570-0024.840 another possible choice is herbert wilkins a governor sargent appointee and next to hennessy the court most senior member
f3ajrlp6-0024.840-0028.920 the other three associateaj justices were put on the bench by governor edward king
f3ajrlp6-0028.920-0039.850 and many lawyers say that despite dukakis promise to keep the judiciary above the political fray it unlikely dukakis will choose a king appointee to run the state highest court

f3aprlp1-0000.000-0009.110 computerized phone calls which do everything from selling magazine subscriptions to reminding people about meetings have become the telephone equivalent of junk mail
f3aprlp1-0009.110-0015.720 but a new application of the technology is about to be tried out in massachusetts to ease crowded jail conditions
f3aprlp1-0015.720-0033.420 next week some inmates released early from the hampton county jail in springfield will be wearing a wristband that hooks up with a special jack on their home phones >brth whenever a computer randomly calls them from jail the former prisoner plugs in to let corrections officials know theyre in the right place at the right time
f3aprlp1-0033.420-0035.980 wbur margo melnicove reports
f3aprlp2-0000.000-0007.450 the device is attached to a plastic wristband it looks like a watch it functions like an electronic probation officer
f3aprlp2-0007.450-0013.830 when a computerized call is made to a former prisoner home phone that person answers by plugging in the device
f3aprlp2-0013.830-0020.840 the wristband can be removed only by breaking its clasp and if that done the inmate is immediately returned to jail
f3aprlp2-0020.840-0031.950 the description conjures up images of big brother watching but jay ash deputy superintendent of the hampton county jail in springfield says the surveillance system is not that sinister
f3aprlp3-0000.000-0008.120 such supervision according to ash is a sensible cost effective alternative to incarceration that should not alarm civil libertarians
f3aprlp3-0008.120-0013.820 doctor norman rosenblatt dean of the college of criminal justice at northeastern university agrees
f3aprlp4-0000.000-0006.470 rosenblatt expects electronic surveillance in parole situations to become more wide spread and he thinks eventually
f3aprlp4-0006.470-0008.360 people will get used to the idea
f3aprlp4-0008.360-0019.510 springfield jail deputy superintendent ash says although it will allow some prisoners to be released a few months before their sentences are up concerns that may raise about public safety are not well founded
f3aprlp4-0019.510-0025.630 most county jail inmates did not commit violent crimes theyre in jail for such things as bad checks or stealing
f3aprlp4-0025.630-0036.260 those on early release must check in with corrections officials fifty times a week according to ash who says about half the contacts for a select group will now be made by the computerized phone calls
f3aprlp4-0036.260-0039.390 initially the program will involve only a handful of inmates
f3aprlp4-0039.390-0043.780 ash says the ultimate goal is to use it to get about forty out of jail early
f3aprlp4-0043.780-0049.300 the springfield jail built for two hundred seventy people now houses more than five hundred

f3arrlp1-0000.000-0006.820 massachusetts may now have the toughest drunken driving law in the nation thanks to the safe roads act that became law this week
f3arrlp1-0006.820-0014.530 the legislation came complete with a message from the governor to those seeking a little too much comfort and joy this holiday season and beyond
f3arrlp2-0000.000-0012.390 under the new law the consequences of driving drunk will be swift and severe under the old already tough law first time offenders used to lose their license for thirty days >brth well now they could lose it for as many as ninety
f3arrlp2-0012.390-0015.930 the prison sentence for a second time offender has now doubled
f3arrlp2-0015.930-0021.470 the law is also tougher for vehicular homicide and it cracks down on minors who drink and drive
f3arrlp2-0021.470-0026.430 state trooper joseph holly says this tough new law will mean fewer drunken drivers
f3arrlp3-0000.000-0009.510 well that what supporters of the safe roads act are hoping anyway but will it work massachusetts got tough on drunken drivers years ago what going to make the difference this time around
f3arrlp3-0009.510-0015.800 ralph henksen is chief of the social and behavioral science section at boston university school of public health
f3arrlp3-0015.800-0022.720 he says research into what deters the drunken driver shows that often those who drink and drive are risk takers
f3arrlp3-0022.720-0027.500 even when theyre sober theyre more likely to run red lights and shun the seat belt
f3arrlp3-0027.500-0031.260 if they think they can drink and drive and get away with it theyll try
f3arrlp4-0000.000-0011.660 and in fact the state is not planning on putting more police on the road state officials say there will be the same levels of enforcement bu professor henksen believes the key to the new law success is its enforcement
f3arrlp5-0000.000-0013.850 the state safe roads act is only a few days old but it already facing a challenge the man who directed the successful effort last election to get the mandatory seat belt law stripped from the law books >brth is now vying to try to repeal part of this law
f3arrlp5-0013.850-0027.670 lynn activist chip ford has yet to give a name to his committee but he already set its goal to repeal what is the most controversial clause in the safe roads act the per se clause which allows someone to be punished for drinking and driving
f3arrlp5-0027.670-0030.200 before theyve even been tried in court
f3arrlp5-0030.200-0046.920 under the per se part of this new law if youre arrested take a breath test and your blood content level registers point one oh or higher you can automatically lose your license for ninety days and that just at your arraignment then you still got to face dwi charges at a trial
f3arrlp5-0046.920-0051.890 state officials say about a quarter of all those arrested for drunken driving are repeat offenders
f3arrlp5-0051.890-0055.860 they say the per se clause will get those people off the road sooner
f3arrlp5-0055.860-0061.840 chip ford says it may indeed get them off the road but it will do it at the expense of their civil rights
f3arrlp6-0000.000-0007.620 ford and other opponents of the per se clause say it relies exclusively on the breath test and they say breathalizers are simply unreliable
f3arrlp6-0007.620-0012.820 john tarantino is a providence attorney who specializes in drunken driving cases
f3arrlp7-0000.000-0012.670 tarantino says because of people physiological differences the breathalizer test will always be inaccurate on about fourteen percent of the population those people will register as having more alcohol in their blood than they actually do
f3arrlp7-0012.670-0026.540 but state officials are convinced that a problem while they do say breathalizers are one hundred percent accurate they do say they are extremely reliable and if they err at all it on the conservative side the side favorable to the driver
f3arrlp7-0026.540-0036.030 as for those who say that taking away someone license based on the breathalizer results is tantamount to trial by machine state officials say that simply is so
f3arrlp7-0036.030-0041.900 losing one license under the per se clause is not a criminal offense you wo get a criminal record for it
f3arrlp7-0041.900-0047.430 it is a civil infraction and one that they believe will be a key deterrent to the drunken driver
f3arrlp7-0047.430-0060.690 if the per se clause is tested in court the state says it will pass constitutional muster and if opponents gather enough signatures to make it a ballot question in nineteen eighty eight state officials predict voters will keep it intact

f3atrlp3-0020.080-0028.010 if one had existed in their schools they say they would have used it for someone to talk to about sex and for a safe place to get birth control

m1bjrlp6-0000.000-0009.380 all but one of the chief justices since eighteen ninety nine when oliver wendell holmes was appointed came from the ranks of sjc associateaj judges
m1bjrlp6-0009.380-0014.260 if he sticks with tradition dukakis is likely to elevate one of his appointees to chief
m1bjrlp6-0014.260-0018.190 that means paul leocos or ruth abrams the only woman on the court
m1bjrlp6-0018.190-0025.110 another possible choice is herbert wilkins a governor sargent appointee and next to hennessy the court most senior member
m1bjrlp6-0025.110-0029.270 the other three associateaj justices were put on the bench by governor edward king
m1bjrlp6-0029.270-0039.280 and many lawyers say that despite dukakis promise to keep the judiciary above the political fray it unlikely dukakis will choose a king appointee to run the state highest court

m1bprlp1-0000.000-0007.870 computerized phone calls which do everything from selling magazine subscriptions to reminding people about meetings have become the telephone equivalent of junk mail
m1bprlp1-0007.870-0017.860 but a new application of the technology is about to be tried out in massachusetts to ease crowded jail conditions next week some inmates released early from the hampton county jail in springfield
m1bprlp1-0017.860-0021.940 will be wearing a wristband that hooks up with a special jack on their home phones
m1bprlp1-0021.940-0029.880 whenever a computer randomly calls them from jail the former prisoner plugs in to let corrections officials know theyre in the right place at the right time
m1bprlp1-0029.880-0031.700 margo melnicove reports
m1bprlp2-0000.000-0006.490 the device is attached to a plastic wristband it looks like a watch it functions like an electronic probation officer
m1bprlp2-0006.490-0012.950 when a computerized call is made to a former prisoner home phone that person answers by plugging in the device
m1bprlp2-0012.950-0019.520 the wristband can be removed only by breaking its clasp and if that done the inmate is immediately returned to jail
m1bprlp2-0019.520-0022.930 the description conjures up images of big brother watching
m1bprlp2-0022.930-0029.970 but jay ash deputy superintendent of the hampton county jail in springfield says the surveillance system is not that sinister
m1bprlp3-0000.000-0008.170 such supervision according to ash is a sensible cost effective alternative to incarceration that should not alarm civil libertarians
m1bprlp3-0008.170-0013.430 doctor norman rosenblatt dean of the college of criminal justice at northeastern university agrees
m1bprlp4-0000.000-0008.010 rosenblatt expects electronic surveillance in parole situations to become more wide spread and he thinks eventually people will get used to the idea
m1bprlp4-0008.010-0019.060 springfield jail deputy superintendent ash says although it will allow some prisoners to be released a few months before their sentences are up concerns that may raise about public safety are not well founded
m1bprlp4-0019.060-0025.510 most county jail inmates did not commit violent crimes theyre in jail for such things as bad checks or stealing
m1bprlp4-0025.510-0035.870 those on early release must check in with corrections officials fifty times a week according to ash who says about half the contacts for a select group will now be made by the computerized phone calls
m1bprlp4-0035.870-0039.170 initially the program will involve only a handful of inmates
m1bprlp4-0039.170-0043.250 ash says the ultimate goal is to use it to get about forty out of jail early
m1bprlp4-0043.250-0048.210 the springfield jail built for two hundred seventy people now houses more than five hundred

m1brrlp1-0000.000-0006.640 massachusetts may now have the toughest drunken driving law in the nation thanks to the safe roads act that became law this week
m1brrlp1-0006.640-0014.230 the legislation came complete with a message from the governor to those seeking a little too much comfort and joy this holiday season and beyond
m1brrlp2-0000.000-0004.150 under the new law the consequences of driving drunk will be swift and severe
m1brrlp2-0004.150-0009.130 under the old already tough law first time offenders used to lose their license for thirty days
m1brrlp2-0009.130-0011.600 well now they could lose it for as many as ninety
m1brrlp2-0011.600-0014.810 the prison sentence for a second time offender has now doubled
m1brrlp2-0014.810-0020.510 the law is also tougher for vehicular homicide and it cracks down on minors who drink and drive
m1brrlp2-0020.510-0025.310 state trooper joseph holly says this tough new law will mean fewer drunken drivers
m1brrlp3-0000.000-0004.250 well that what supporters of the safe roads act are hoping anyway but will it work
m1brrlp3-0004.250-0007.360 massachusetts got tough on drunken drivers years ago
m1brrlp3-0007.360-0015.640 what going to make the difference this time around ralph henksen is chief of the social and behavioral science section at the boston university school of public health
m1brrlp3-0015.640-0021.750 he says research into what deters the drunken driver shows that often those who drink and drive are risk takers
m1brrlp3-0021.750-0026.040 even when theyre sober theyre more likely to run red lights and shun the seat belt
m1brrlp3-0026.040-0029.580 if they think they can drink and drive and get away with it theyll try
m1brrlp4-0000.000-0003.630 and in fact the state is not planning on putting more police on the road
m1brrlp4-0003.630-0011.550 state officials say there will be the same levels of enforcement bu professor henksen believes the key to the new law success is its enforcement
m1brrlp5-0000.000-0004.200 the state safe roads act is only a few days old but it already facing a challenge
m1brrlp5-0004.200-0009.870 the man who directed the successful effort last election to get the mandatory seat belt law stripped from the law books
m1brrlp5-0009.870-0012.620 is now vowing to try to repeal part of this law
m1brrlp5-0012.620-0026.890 lynn activist chip ford has yet to give a name to his committee but he already set its goal to repeal what is the most controversial clause in the safe roads act the per se clause which allows someone to be punished for drinking and driving before theyve even been tried in court
m1brrlp5-0026.890-0037.730 under the per se part of this new law if youre arrested take a breath test and your blood content level registers point one oh or higher you can automatically lose your license for ninety days
m1brrlp5-0037.730-0042.700 and that just at your arraignment then you still got to face dwi charges at a trial
m1brrlp5-0042.700-0051.640 state officials say about a quarter of all those arrested for drunken drivers are repeat offenders they say the per se clause will get those people off the road sooner
m1brrlp5-0051.640-0057.471 chip ford says it may indeed get them off the road but it will do it at the expense of their civil rights
m1brrlp6-0000.000-0013.130 ford and other opponents of the per se clause say it relies exclusively on the breath test and they say breathalizers are simply unreliable john tarantino is a providence attorney who specializes in drunken driving cases
m1brrlp7-0000.000-0008.330 tarantino says because of people physiological differences the breathalizer test will always be inaccurate on about fourteen percent of the population
m1brrlp7-0008.330-0012.860 those people will register as having more alcohol in their blood than they actually do
m1brrlp7-0012.860-0015.640 but state officials are convinced that a problem
m1brrlp7-0015.640-0025.870 while they do say breathalizers are one hundred percent accurate they do say they are extremely reliable and if they err at all it on the conservative side the side favorable to the driver
m1brrlp7-0025.870-0034.980 as for those who say that taking away someone license based on the breathalizer results is tantamount to trial by machine state officials say that simply is so
m1brrlp7-0034.980-0040.990 losing one license under the per se clause is not a criminal offense you wo get a criminal record for it
m1brrlp7-0040.990-0046.400 it is a civil infraction and one that they believe will be a key deterrent to the drunken driver
m1brrlp7-0046.400-0050.690 if the clause is tested in court the state says it will pass constitutional muster
m1brrlp7-0050.690-0057.870 and if opponents gather enough signatures to make it a ballot question in nineteen eighty eight state officials predict voters will keep it intact
m1bs01p1-0000.000-0004.870 it been known for some time that male students tend to be more vocal than their female counterparts
m1bs01p1-0004.870-0008.000 studies conducted at a number of universities have shown that
m1bs01p1-0008.000-0020.000 but when norton massachusetts based wheaton college went coed last year professor frendy mayor realized she had a golden opportunity to observe the impact of introducing men into previously all female classes
m1bs01p1-0020.000-0022.770 mayor had four different classes videotaped
m1bs01p1-0022.770-0026.520 and painstakingly timed every utterance by every student
m1bs01p2-0000.000-0007.510 mayor hastens to point out that four randomly selected classes do necessarily represent all others but the trend was undeniable
m1bs01p2-0007.510-0013.060 mayor worked on the study with catherine krupnik a lecturer at harvard graduate school of education
m1bs01p2-0013.060-0019.080 krupnik conducted a similar study at harvard with similar results but found one big difference at wheaton
m1bs01p3-0000.000-0005.280 mayor and krupnik are only just beginning to look beyond the actual time male and female students speak
m1bs01p3-0005.280-0008.670 to issues of content and the dynamics of interaction
m1bs01p3-0008.670-0014.910 using mainly anecdotal evidence theyve noticed that so called outliers students who do speak at all in class
m1bs01p3-0014.910-0020.520 tend to be women and also that men are more likely than women to interrupt their classmates or teachers
m1bs01p3-0020.520-0029.000 but catherine krupnik says the disparity between male and female contributions was actually smaller in classes where the teacher held tight reign over the discussion
m1bs01p4-0000.000-0005.990 the conclusions krupnik and mayor draw from their research throw the burden of class participation mainly on the teacher
m1bs01p4-0005.990-0015.610 they say given that classroom participation is an important part of learning in this country teachers must actively encourage silent students especially women to speak up
m1bs01p4-0015.610-0022.634 they also say female teachers who often defer to challenging male students may be poor role models for their female students
m1bs01p4-0022.634-0027.541 at the time wheaton was considering going coed some alumni strongly objected
m1bs01p4-0027.541-0033.400 arguing in part that men would undermine the leadership opportunities women get at a single sex college
m1bs01p4-0033.400-0040.600 this study may confirm those fears but according to student jeff lafave awareness of the situation is part of the solution
m1bs01p5-0000.000-0006.080 mayor and krupnik plan to continue their research this year on the effects of coeducation in the classrooms of wheaton
m1bs02p1-0000.000-0008.490 words belong to abraham lincoln but they describe the feeling within the student democratic movement a movement currently exiled to the united states and other countries
m1bs02p1-0008.490-0017.730 during the pro-democracy protests and subsequent tiananmen square massacre in china this spring chinese students in this country became familiar media commentators
m1bs02p1-0017.730-0021.630 they distributed information from home and denounced the government crackdown
m1bs02p1-0021.630-0029.410 today about forty thousand students remain in the us waiting watching wondering when and if they can safely return home
m1bs02p1-0029.410-0031.240 and where theyll live in the meantime
m1bs02p2-0000.000-0006.890 merle goldman who teaches chinese history at boston university says there already evidence of a crackdown against intellectuals in china
m1bs02p2-0006.890-0013.580 many students in the us she says are hoping to wait out the hard-line storm hoping calmer times are too far off
m1bs02p3-0000.000-0011.270 chung yu and his colleague chau fong wong work on cancer research at mit theyd like to continue their work in china but both spent years laboring in the chinese countryside during the cultural revolution
m1bs02p3-0011.270-0014.720 and refuse to go back if they face another government crackdown
m1bs02p3-0014.720-0015.900 chau fong wong
m1bs02p4-0000.000-0010.030 both wong and yu are now learning a new skill how to move the american legislative process theyve been at the forefront of efforts by chinese students to change their us visa status
m1bs02p4-0010.030-0014.090 currently eighty percent of chinese students hold so-called j visas
m1bs02p4-0014.090-0019.300 which require them to return to china for two years before they can even apply for us residency
m1bs02p4-0019.300-0023.400 differing bills to wave the two year rule have passed the senate and house
m1bs02p4-0023.400-0025.290 and are on their way to a conference committee
m1bs02p4-0025.290-0030.620 but time is critical because there may be several thousand students whose visas have already expired
m1bs02p4-0030.620-0035.340 most of those have not signed up for the one year extension granted by president bush in june
m1bs02p4-0035.340-0039.070 because that measure requires them to return to china at the end of the year
m1bs02p4-0039.070-0044.850 another option would be to seek political asylum but chou fong wong says that could be dangerous as well
m1bs02p5-0000.000-0002.240 students in the us do have other options
m1bs02p5-0002.240-0005.860 canada and several european nations have been quicker to grant them residency
m1bs02p5-0005.860-0008.810 and singapore and taiwan are actively recruiting them
m1bs02p5-0008.810-0013.500 but no matter what most say theyre determined not to go back home at least not yet
m1bs02p7-0000.000-0014.970 no one knows just how hard beijing new hard-line policy is or how long it will last but as chinese leaders celebrate their forty years in power forty thousand of their citizens look on from across the pacific a highly educated well organized critical mass

m1bs03p4-0000.000-0014.490 you see aaron does like push-ups so when he heard about the nanny school at a career day last year aaron signed up to become its first male student not that other males have shown interest it just that none of them ever went through with it according to school president karen hamlin
m1bs03p5-0000.000-0013.970 according to the international nanny association the increase in households with both parents working has set off a nanny boom the group estimates ten of thousands of nannies are now at work in the us with dozens of accredited schools training new nannies every year
m1bs03p5-0013.970-0017.680 karen hamlin says her school used to have trouble attracting students
m1bs03p5-0017.680-0020.460 because many thought nanny work akin to slavery
m1bs03p6-0000.000-0002.900 these days hamlin says she turning away applicants
m1bs04p3-0000.000-0006.020 hill version was produced in london two years before webber although the later received the lion share of attention
m1bs04p3-0006.020-0011.980 but the us tour of hill phantom began this year long after webber had established itself in new york
m1bs04p4-0000.000-0002.920 that jonathan rinus one of the hill version producers
m1bs04p4-0002.920-0008.970 rinus san francisco based theater in the square mounted a ten month production of hill phantom late last year
m1bs04p4-0008.970-0012.500 and the producer says no one confused his show with webber
m1bs04p5-0000.000-0009.340 when tickets for the wang center production of hill phantom went on sale in october theater goers flocked to the box office spurred on by ads with the show title in large type
m1bs04p5-0009.340-0012.830 and a disclaimer distinguishing the show from webber in small type
m1bs04p5-0012.830-0019.020 around that time the boston globe theater critic kevin kelly wrote a series of articles on the two phantoms
m1bs04p5-0019.020-0030.010 kelly could not be reached for comment but in one piece he said it is almost inconceivable that hill phantom would be playing a four thousand seat theater like the wang without the success of webber phantom
m1bs04p5-0030.010-0034.060 in another article he wrote that hordes of people are being suckered in
m1bs04p5-0034.060-0036.600 by a second hand version of phantom of the opera
m1bs04p5-0036.600-0042.580 another globe article reported that people in line at the wang center thought they were buying tickets for webber show
m1bs04p5-0042.580-0046.260 at least seven pieces on the controversy appeared in the space of a month
m1bs04p5-0046.260-0051.180 neither kelly nor the reporter who wrote the remaining stories had seen hill phantom at the time
m1bs04p6-0000.000-0006.380 attorney h yale gutnick represents hill phantom which has filed a libel suit against theater critic kelly and the globe
m1bs04p8-0000.000-0007.740 the globe hopes the case will be dismissed before the phantom comes to town in early january but the case could drag on well past the shows run

m1bs05p2-0024.770-0033.960 one major topic of this week conference is what lessons china can learn from the radical changes currently underway in eastern europe fdc board member david ma
m1bs05p3-0000.000-0007.150 ma says the sixteen hundred member fdc can learn not only from the successes but also from the failures of eastern european reform
m1bs05p3-0007.150-0010.530 he points to countries such as czechoslovakia and east germany
m1bs05p3-0010.530-0014.800 where opposition leaders were caught off guard by the rapid demise of the communists
m1bs05p3-0014.800-0017.620 and are only now trying to form political parties
m1bs05p3-0017.620-0022.020 ma says the fdc will be ready to step into a power vacuum in china
m1bs05p4-0000.000-0006.940 but three month history of the fdc has already shown what internal hurdles the group must clear before it can present a united front
m1bs05p4-0006.940-0011.730 there disagreement for example over what kind of relationship to establish with taiwan
m1bs05p4-0011.730-0017.520 taiwanese money could help the group but it might open the fdc up to charges of being a taiwanese pawn
m1bs05p4-0017.520-0025.880 also says boston university chinese history professor merle goldman the group suffers from a generation gap between students like wer kai she
m1bs05p4-0025.880-0028.060 and the more seasoned political thinkers
m1bs05p5-0000.000-0006.400 the fdc will issue several policy statements at the close of the conference on sunday including one on the taiwan issue
m1bs05p5-0006.400-0011.790 group leaders also hope then to present the fdc as a strong focused party in exile

m1bs07p7-0000.000-0004.860 scoffield found that the real difference between turbo tax and tax cut is the kind of help they give you
m1bs07p7-0004.860-0009.670 turbo tax offers the exact irs instructions for each line at the push of a button
m1bs07p7-0009.670-0014.530 tax cut provides a computerized expert who will walk you through the forms step by step
m1bs07p9-0000.000-0007.950 all n all scoffield found tax cut to be a better program for people who do know a lot about taxes although he found its numerous help screen slowed him down
m1bs07p9-0007.950-0011.150 for those who do need as much help he recommends turbo tax
m1bs07p9-0011.150-0019.080 as for who should use computer programs in the first place he says for both very complicated and very simple returns they probably are worth the money

m1bs09p1-0008.270-0010.980 and alleged mafia captain mathew guillemetti
m1bs09p1-0010.980-0018.250 when us attorney general dick thornberg detailed the charges facing the suspects the huge scope of the investigation became clear
m1bs09p2-0000.000-0005.780 the investigation involved both federal and state law enforcement agents in connecticut rhode island and massachusetts
m1bs09p2-0005.780-0011.310 the indictments include charges that some defendants ran several gambling clubs in connecticut and new york
m1bs09p2-0011.310-0017.360 an official said the operation was unprecedented for its successful infiltration of the mob inner sanctum
m1bs09p2-0017.360-0025.560 according to the indictment agents were able to record secretly a patriarca family induction ceremony in medford massachusetts last october
m1bs09p2-0025.560-0030.700 the government alleges that four new family members pledged to kill the organization enemies
m1bs09p2-0030.700-0046.840 then blood was drawn from the inductees index finger and an image of the patriarca family saint was burned the new members allegedly said in italian quote as burns this saint so will burn my soul i want to enter alive into this organization and i will leave it dead

m1bs10p1-0000.000-0014.520 clt petition was only one of four discussed at yesterday hearing and the very fact that four petitions each altering tax policy in some way have received thousands of voter signatures illustrates the extent of public frustration over the state budget mess
m1bs10p1-0014.520-0019.360 the clt proposal is the only one of the four that would result in a net loss of revenue
m1bs10p1-0019.360-0028.520 it would lower the state income tax rate to four and a quarter percent for eighteen months returning to tax payers the money currently being raised by a temporary tax increase
m1bs10p1-0028.520-0036.270 critics say the plan will only compound the state ballooning deficit clt founder barbara anderson responded to those charges yesterday
m1bs10p2-0000.000-0006.820 to make up the current deficit anderson suggests offering special bonds to be sold to average bay state residents at bank windows
m1bs10p2-0006.820-0014.550 she says there are public spirited citizens who would buy the bonds but never cash them in effectively making a charitable gift to state coffers
m1bs10p2-0014.550-0021.380 in very direct opposition to the clt petition is one sponsored by team the tax equity alliance for massachusetts
m1bs10p2-0021.380-0029.870 it would raise the tax on some capital gains broaden the sales tax base and in a move opposed by many legislators would earmark the money it raises
m1bs10p2-0029.870-0031.620 jim braudy represents team
m1bs10p3-0000.000-0012.930 a similar measure sponsored by moses a public employees union and a proposal by the massachusetts municipal association that would require lawmakers to give a percentage of revenue directly to local aid are also being debated by the taxation committee
m1bs10p3-0012.930-0018.050 sponsors of all four measures defend their attempts to bypass lawmakers with ballots
m1bs10p3-0018.050-0018.840 jim braudy
m1bs10p4-0000.000-0004.810 echoing that idea in a rare moment of agreement with braudy was clt founder barbara anderson
m1bs10p5-0000.000-0008.310 but critics of taxation by initiative petition say it the people duly elected representatives not the people themselves who should be writing the tax laws
m1bs10p5-0008.310-0012.020 richard manley is president of the massachusetts taxpayers foundation
m1bs10p6-0000.000-0019.870 manley says one potential problem with going to the voters has already been experienced in california where conflicting ballot measures have been passed on several occasions leaving the courts to work out the mess to try and head off that problem here secretary of state michael conley wants the conflicting questions to be grouped together on the ballot with only the biggest vote getter passing into law
m1bs10p6-0019.870-0024.300 before that however lawmakers will have their chance to vote up or down on the measure
m1bs10p6-0024.300-0030.660 if they vote no the sponsors must gather more than eight-thousand new signatures to secure a place on this year ballot
m1bs10p6-0030.660-0032.990 for wbur im andy bowers
m1bs11p1-0000.000-0015.140 a large portion of the debate centered on the question of who a political insider whose an outsider and why it makes any difference bu president silber repeatedly touted his outsider status saying it beacon hill insiders who caused the current fiscal crisis
m1bs11p1-0015.140-0031.990 frank bellotti whose outsider label has been questioned recently yesterday used the term independent and jack flood admitted he insider in that he knows the ins and outs of beacon hill but says he remained outside the main stream of lawmakers who are responsible for the current fiscal crisis
m1bs11p1-0031.990-0036.970 flood also criticized silber recent habit of making controversial remarks in interviews
m1bs11p2-0000.000-0008.830 another point of contention was the democratic party rule requiring a candidate to receive fifteen percent of convention delegate support to appear on the primary ballot
m1bs11p2-0008.830-0018.610 both silber and flood may have trouble reaching the fifteen percent mark and silber has been actively campaigning to repeal the rule which prompted this response from front-runner bellotti
m1bs11p4-0000.000-0014.860 the candidates did discuss some of the tough issues facing the bay state this year including how to get out from under the current eight hundred million dollar budget shortfall sil flood called for a temporary income tax hike perhaps to six percent as well as for another revenue raising measure
m1bs11p5-0000.000-0003.180 both silber and bellotti echoed flood call for a tax hike
m1bs11p5-0003.180-0006.860 on the emotional issue of abortion though there was sharp disagreement
m1bs11p5-0006.860-0015.980 while bellotti declared himself clearly pro-choice silber described himself as morally opposed to abortion although he pledged to support pro-choice policies
m1bs11p6-0000.000-0003.720 but john flood blasted silber for not following his moral beliefs
m1bs11p7-0000.000-0005.070 one of the debate lighter moments came after flood compared himself to the late president harry truman
m1bs11p7-0005.070-0014.260 in a play on lloyd bentsen famous debate line from the nineteen eighty eight presidential race silber then said i knew harry truman and joe flood ai no harry truman
m1bs11p7-0014.260-0019.170 the remark backfired though when john flood said he knew no one named joe flood

m1btrlp1-0000.000-0010.300 more than half of america youngsters have had sexual intercourse by the time theyre seventeen and many seldom use birth control according to a recent lewis harris poll sponsored by planned parenthood
m1btrlp1-0010.300-0015.220 advocates of dispensing contraceptives in schools see the poll as supporting their case
m1btrlp1-0015.220-0021.140 others say easier availability of birth control for teenagers will make an alarming situation much worse
m1btrlp1-0021.140-0025.860 the issue has already stirred heated debate in boston where it bound to surface again
m1btrlp1-0025.860-0033.960 next month the superintendent of boston public schools is expected to put thumbs up or thumbs down on a proposal to establish school based health clinics
m1btrlp1-0033.960-0037.010 that would among other things dispense birth control devices
m1btrlp1-0037.010-0039.690 wbur margo melnicove reports
m1btrlp2-0000.000-0005.890 if present trends continue this year in massachusetts approximately fourteen thousand teenagers will become pregnant
m1btrlp2-0005.890-0010.830 three of them are these students at saint margaret hospital alternative school for pregnant teens
m1btrlp2-0010.830-0013.160 they are sixteen or seventeen years old
m1btrlp2-0013.160-0015.880 two are from boston one is from out of town
m1btrlp3-0000.000-0002.530 this last young mother-to-be is luckier than many
m1btrlp3-0002.530-0014.730 she and the father of her child are married and are planning for the future and even though she been sexually active since she was twelve she avoided unwanted pregnancies by using birth control pills that her mother helped her get at a local hospital
m1btrlp3-0014.730-0018.590 these three young woman like the idea of school based health clinics
m1btrlp3-0018.590-0023.830 if one had existed in their schools they say they would have used it for someone to talk to about sex
m1btrlp3-0023.830-0026.010 and for a safe place to get birth control
m1btrlp3-0026.010-0034.760 a pilot project to set up such clinics in two to four boston middle and high schools was proposed last spring by the boston student human services collaborative
m1btrlp3-0034.760-0038.640 the plan was endorsed last fall by the adolescent issues task force
m1btrlp3-0038.640-0040.890 set up by the superintendent of schools
m1btrlp3-0040.890-0048.490 task force member mary conroy who directs family life education at saint margaret was one of a few dissenting votes against the endorsement
m1btrlp4-0000.000-0011.050 these claims are disputed by the head of the task force doctor deborah prothro-stith she says since students do use existing services school based clinics would be an alternative rather than a duplication
m1btrlp4-0011.050-0017.630 and she says like health care in the work place the thrust of health care in the schools is to overcome access barriers
m1btrlp5-0000.000-0016.610 kids do have sex because contraceptives are or are not available according to prothro-stith and while she does not condone sexual activity among teens she thinks medically it unfair to deny access to contraceptives to some because others object to their availability in schools on religious grounds
m1btrlp6-0000.000-0015.660 prothro-stith points out that if school based clinics were established parental permission would be required for students to receive each service offered and that birth control would be only part of a comprehensive program dealing with other adolescent issues like depression suicide and eating disorders
m1btrlp6-0015.660-0020.500 she agrees with mary conroy that the roots of these problems dig deep into society
m1btrlp6-0020.500-0034.120 but while conroy strongly opposes school based clinics as a solution calling them a bandaid that wo work prothro-stith says both attention to teenagers immediate needs as well as long range prevention and health education are needed
m1btrlp7-0000.000-0009.110 problems associated with the proposal to set up health clinics in schools are also expected to multiply if superintendent of schools laval wilson goes along with the idea next month
m1btrlp7-0009.110-0014.390 the boston school committee religious and community leaders have already come to loggerheads over the issue

m2bjrlp1-0000.000-0003.590 wanted chief justice of the massachusetts supreme court
m2bjrlp1-0003.590-0017.860 in april the sjc current leader edward hennessy reaches the mandatory retirement age of seventy and a successor is expected to be named in march it may be the most important appointment governor michael dukakis makes during the remainder of his administration
m2bjrlp1-0017.860-0023.980 and one of the toughest as wbur margo melnicove reports hennessy will be a hard act to follow
m2bjrlp2-0000.000-0006.160 in nineteen seventy-six democratic governor michael dukakis fulfilled a campaign promise to de-politicize judicial appointments
m2bjrlp2-0006.160-0010.670 he named republican edward hennessy to head the state supreme judicial court
m2bjrlp2-0010.670-0017.150 for hennessy it was another step along a distinguished career that began as a trial lawyer and led to an appointment
m2bjrlp2-0017.150-0026.340 as associateaj supreme court justice in nineteen seventy-one that year thomas maffy now president of the massachusetts bar association was hennessy law clerk
m2bjrlp3-0000.000-0007.700 the author of more than eight hundred state supreme court opinions hennessy is widely respected for his legal scholarship and his administrative abilities
m2bjrlp3-0007.700-0019.290 admirers give hennessy much of the credit for sweeping court reform that began a decade ago and for last year legislative approval of thirty-five new judgeships and three hundred million dollars to restore crumbling court houses
m2bjrlp3-0019.290-0027.460 despite the state massive budget deficit hennessy recently urged colleagues in the bar association not to retreat from these hard won gains
m2bjrlp4-0000.000-0003.890 hennessy is the jnc thirty-second chief justice
m2bjrlp4-0003.890-0009.920 holding the court system on the course he has set and plotting it future agenda wo be an easy job for his successor
m2bjrlp5-0000.000-0008.210 attorney haskel kassler chairs the judicial nominating council eighteen attorneys and laypeople charged with screening applicants for vacancies on the bench
m2bjrlp5-0008.210-0016.730 usually the jnc refers three nominees to the governor his top choice is rated by bar associations and grilled by the governor executive council
m2bjrlp5-0016.730-0024.290 kassler says unlike the federal supreme court there no litmus test on particular issues that massachusetts high court nominees must pass
m2bjrlp6-0000.000-0011.970 all but one of the chief justices since eighteen ninety-nine when oliver wendell holmes was appointed came from the ranks of jnc associateaj justices if he sticks with tradition dukakis is likely to elevate one of his appointees to chief
m2bjrlp6-0011.970-0023.170 that means paul leocos or ruth abrams the only woman on the court another possible choice is herbert wilkins a governor sargent appointee and next to hennessy the court most senior member
m2bjrlp6-0023.170-0037.260 the other three associateaj justices were put on the bench by governor edward king and many lawyers say that despite dukakis promise to keep the judiciary above the political fray it unlikely dukakis will choose a king appointee to run the state highest court

m2bprlp1-0000.000-0007.630 computerized phone calls which do everything from selling magazine subscriptions to reminding people about meetings have become the telephone equivalent of junk mail
m2bprlp1-0007.630-0013.610 but a new application of the technology is about to be tried out in massachusetts to ease crowded jail conditions
m2bprlp1-0013.610-0018.110 next week some inmates released early from the hampton county jail in springfield
m2bprlp1-0018.110-0022.370 will be wearing a wristband that hooks up with a special jack on their home phones
m2bprlp1-0022.370-0030.170 whenever a computer randomly calls them from jail the former prisoner plugs in to let correction officials know theyre in the right place at the right time
m2bprlp1-0030.170-0032.180 margo melnicove reports
m2bprlp2-0000.000-0006.280 the device is attached to a plastic wristband it looks like a watch it functions like an electronic probation officer
m2bprlp2-0006.280-0019.070 when a computerized call is made to a former prisoner home phone that person answers by plugging in the device the wristband can be removed only by breaking its clasp and if that done the inmate is immediately returned to jail
m2bprlp2-0019.070-0026.860 the description conjures up images of big brother watching but jay ash deputy superintendent of hampton county jail in springfield says
m2bprlp2-0026.860-0029.530 the surveillance system is not that sinister
m2bprlp3-0000.000-0007.520 such supervision according to ash is a sensible cost effective alternative to incarceration that should not alarm civil libertarians
m2bprlp3-0007.520-0013.090 doctor norman rosenblatt dean of the college of criminal justice at northeastern university agrees
m2bprlp4-0000.000-0011.570 rosenblatt expects electronic surveillance in parole situations to become much more wide spread and he thinks eventually people will get used to the idea springfield jail deputy superintendent ash says
m2bprlp4-0011.570-0037.830 although it will allow some prisoners to be released a few months before their sentences are up concerns that may raise public safety are not well founded most county jail inmates did not commit violent crimes theyre in jail for such things as bad checks or stealing those on early release must check in with correction officials fifty times a week according to ash who says about half the contacts for a select group will now be made by the computerized phone calls
m2bprlp4-0037.830-0050.820 initially the program will involve only a handful of inmates ash says the ultimate goal is to use it to get about forty out of jail early the springfield jail built for two hundred and seventy people now houses more than five hundred

m2brrlp1-0000.000-0006.760 massachusetts may now have the toughest drunken driving law in the nation thanks to the safe roads act that became law this week
m2brrlp1-0006.760-0013.570 the legislation came complete with a message from the governor to those seeking a little too much comfort and joy this holiday season and beyond
m2brrlp2-0000.000-0010.130 under the new law the consequences of driving drunk will be swift and severe under the old already tough law first time offenders used to lose their license for thirty days
m2brrlp2-0010.130-0015.610 well now they could lose it for as many as ninety the prison sentence for a second time offender
m2brrlp2-0015.610-0022.890 has now doubled the law is also tougher for vehicular homicide and it cracks down on minors who drink and drive
m2brrlp2-0022.890-0025.280 state trooper joseph holly says
m2brrlp2-0025.280-0028.510 this tough new law will mean fewer drunken drivers
m2brrlp3-0000.000-0005.130 well that what supporters of safe roads act are hoping anyway but will it work
m2brrlp3-0005.130-0010.740 massachusetts got tough on drunken drivers years ago what going to make the difference this time around
m2brrlp3-0010.740-0014.420 ralph henksen is chief of the social and behavioral science section
m2brrlp3-0014.420-0016.680 at the boston university school of public health
m2brrlp3-0016.680-0020.480 he says research into what deters the drunken driver show
m2brrlp3-0020.480-0027.760 that often those who drink and drive are risk takers even when theyre sober theyre more likely to run red lights and shun the seat belt
m2brrlp3-0027.760-0031.520 if they think they can drink and drive and get away with it theyll try
m2brrlp4-0000.000-0003.980 and in fact the state is not planning on putting more police on the road
m2brrlp4-0003.980-0012.550 state officials say there will be the same level of enforcement bu professor henksen believes the key to the new law success is its enforcement
m2brrlp5-0000.000-0013.130 the state safe roads act is only a few days old but it already facing a challenge the man who directed the successful effort last election to get the mandatory seat belt law stripped from the law books is now vowing to try to repeal part of this law
m2brrlp5-0013.130-0026.280 lynn activist chip ford has yet to give a name to his committee but he already set its goal to repeal what is the most controversial clause in the safe roads act the per se clause which allows someone to be punished for drinking and driving
m2brrlp5-0026.280-0028.390 before theyve even been tried in court
m2brrlp5-0028.390-0039.050 under the per se part of this new law if youre arrested take a breath test and your blood content level registers point one oh or higher you can automatically lose your license for ninety days
m2brrlp5-0039.050-0041.720 and that just at your arraignment
m2brrlp5-0041.720-0050.990 then you still got to face dwi charges at a trial state officials say about a quarter of all those arrested for drunken driving are repeat offenders
m2brrlp5-0050.990-0054.640 they say the per se clause will get those people off the road sooner
m2brrlp5-0054.640-0060.800 chip ford says it may indeed get them off the road but it will do it at the expense of their civil rights
m2brrlp6-0000.000-0008.600 ford and other opponents of the per se clause say it relies exclusively on the breath test and they say breathalizers are simply unreliable
m2brrlp6-0008.600-0013.770 john tarantino is a providence attorney who specializes in drunken driving cases
m2brrlp7-0000.000-0006.170 tarantino says because of people physiological differences the breathalizer will always be inaccurate
m2brrlp7-0006.170-0008.620 on about fourteen percent of the population
m2brrlp7-0008.620-0013.450 those people will register as having more alcohol in their blood than they actually do
m2brrlp7-0013.450-0027.280 but state officials are convinced that a problem while they do say breathalizers are one hundred percent accurate they do say they are extremely reliable and if they err at all it on the conservative side the side favorable to the driver
m2brrlp7-0027.280-0043.150 as for those who say that taking away someone license based on the breathalizer results in tantamount to trial by machine state officials say that simply is so losing one license under the per se clause is not a criminal offense you wo get a criminal record for it
m2brrlp7-0043.150-0045.010 it a civil infraction and one
m2brrlp7-0045.010-0060.900 that they believe will be a key deterrent to the drunken driver if the per se clause is tested in court the state says it will pass constitutional muster and if opponents gather enough signatures to make it a ballot question in nineteen eighty eight state officials predict voters will keep it intact

m2bs02p8-0006.760-0013.280 they pay the highest insurance rates in the nation and last january their permit fees were raised a hundred and fifty-one percent
m2bs02p8-0013.280-0023.470 kiley acknowledges it was the first rate hike in more than a decade but says these increases and a proposal to boost truck fees along the massachusetts turnpike by more than thirty percent
m2bs02p8-0023.470-0025.220 are taking their toll on the industry

m2bs02pa-0000.000-0005.280 already road construction companies are going bankrupt and some trucking firms are moving out of state
m2bs02pa-0005.280-0015.320 the big question now is will the state have the four hundred and forty million dollars it needs to obtain the four point four billion dollars in federal money to build the central artery and third harbor tunnel
m2bs02pa-0015.320-0019.920 and if it can get that money where will it find funds to fix the other state roads
m2bs02pa-0019.920-0022.750 a senate committee will take up that issue later this week
m2bs02pa-0022.750-0025.010 for wbur this is bruce gellerman
m2bs03p1-0000.000-0008.650 in nineteen fifty-seven at the start of a recession a young mit engineer named ken olson took his idea for a computer design to maynard massachusetts
m2bs03p1-0008.650-0017.940 there in an old mill building where cloth for union army uniforms was once manufactured olson set up an office with used lawn furniture and began building an empire
m2bs03p1-0017.940-0026.070 digital equipment corporation now employs a hundred and twenty-eight thousand people in seventy-two countries thirty-four thousand workers are in massachusetts
m2bs03p2-0000.000-0009.670 labor and office space were cheap in massachusetts start-up capital and defense department money available and mit expertise nearby digital or dec took off
m2bs03p2-0009.670-0015.340 now the second largest computer company in the world digital is one of the most profitable companies in the united states
m2bs03p2-0015.340-0024.700 olson is still head of the company he founded with just seventy thousand dollars and his success became the blueprint for scores of other mit trained engineer entrepreneurs
m2bs03p3-0000.000-0004.740 for the past decade that flame has burned with an intensity unmatched by any other industry
m2bs03p3-0004.740-0018.470 two thousand high tech firms now call massachusetts home half did exist just ten years ago many following in digital and prime footsteps setting up corporate headquarters along route one twenty-eight america high tech highway
m2bs03p3-0018.470-0032.020 but now that flame is burning less brightly a computer trade group predicts an industry-wide slowdown will last until nineteen ninety-three and massachusetts companies first to develop the technology are also the first to feel the effects
m2bs03p3-0032.020-0035.700 glenn rifkin is features editor of framingham-based computer world
m2bs03p4-0000.000-0005.730 digital recently announced a big drop in profits four thousand technicians are being retrained for sales
m2bs03p4-0005.730-0011.170 once hiring ten thousand workers a year a partial hiring and wage freeze has now been proposed
m2bs03p4-0011.170-0014.270 at westborough-based general data things are worse
m2bs03p4-0014.270-0018.610 after three losing years plants have been closed and three thousand workers let go
m2bs03p4-0018.610-0025.850 and wang laboratories in lowell is struggling for survival borrowing heavily it lost more than four hundred million dollars last year
m2bs03p4-0025.850-0028.670 and will shed three thousand workers in coming months
m2bs03p4-0028.670-0032.450 the effects are rippling through the entire industry built around one twenty-eight
m2bs03p5-0000.000-0005.220 massachusetts computer companies were built largely around one kind of computer the minicomputer
m2bs03p5-0005.220-0016.210 but now seventy minicomputer makers compete for customers and because newer workstations and personal computers are often faster and cheaper companies that relied on the minicomputer are suffering
m2bs03p6-0000.000-0006.270 the computer industry is cyclical and it has been hit by hard times before but times are especially challenging now
m2bs03p6-0006.270-0013.040 the rapidly changing technology and market conditions are squeezing profit margins and making the future uncertain william pedusca
m2bs03p7-0000.000-0021.270 pedusca points to his watch and predicts that in a few years it will have the immense computing power of the workstations he developed at prime in nineteen seventy-two smaller and smaller computers and the failure of massachusetts firms to anticipate the development of the personal computer helped lead to the troubles facing just about all of the major computer companies in the state according to glenn rifkin
m2bs03p8-0000.000-0005.400 ten years ago two upstart entrepreneurs had aligned with tandy radio shack to market one under its name
m2bs03p8-0005.400-0014.510 and some blame management for the delay suggesting aging entrepreneurs suffered from founders disease an affliction where success clouds the vision of the future
m2bs03p8-0014.510-0018.510 william pedusca founded two successful companies then walked away
m2bs03p9-0000.000-0008.210 some say an wang the brilliant entrepreneur who founded wang laboratories should have relinquished control of the company long before he handed it over to his son
m2bs03p9-0008.210-0012.150 recently after record losses were announced a new president was named
m2bs03p9-0012.150-0017.840 but glenn rifkin of computer world says more fundamental problems plague massachusetts computer industry
m2bs03p9-0017.840-0021.830 companies made billions developing their own proprietary systems
m2bs03p9-0021.830-0025.390 that is computers not compatible with another firm machines
m2bs03p9-0025.390-0028.770 now however rifkin says the market direction has changed
m2bs03pa-0000.000-0003.170 digital has developed industry-wide compatible computers
m2bs03pa-0003.170-0007.370 and soon it will announce its entry into the top-of-the-line supercomputing field
m2bs03pa-0007.370-0016.850 wang and data general have developed compatible machines using off-the-shelf technology that cheaper but they were slower to make the change and theyre now paying the price
m2bs03pa-0016.850-0022.490 problems in the massachusetts computer industry make it ripe for rumors and predictions of gloom and doom
m2bs03pa-0022.490-0029.500 for example yesterday boston newspapers reported wang would lay off ten thousand workers a third of its workforce in the coming year
m2bs03pa-0029.500-0031.230 wang spokesman paul henning
m2bs04p2-0000.000-0004.140 what will emerge will be an industry very different from the one that now exists
m2bs04p2-0004.140-0009.400 the rapidly changing technology that gave birth to the computer companies is now transforming them
m2bs04p3-0000.000-0005.110 computer sales are sluggish and there a fundamental change in the economics of the computer industry
m2bs04p3-0005.110-0011.640 the development of cheaper faster machines is narrowing profit margins forcing companies to cut down on overhead
m2bs04p3-0011.640-0014.680 wang laboratories and data general are losing money
m2bs04p3-0014.680-0019.940 and even giant digital equipment corporation announced profits were down twenty-two percent last quarter
m2bs04p3-0019.940-0025.860 still digital will make more than a billion dollars this year and company president ken olson is optimistic
m2bs04p4-0000.000-0017.100 digital may be the only computer company based in the state to emerge intact after today computer market shakeout the once upstart industry is maturing and consolidating olson predicts that like the auto industry there will be just a few big companies manufacturing computers in the future perhaps a half dozen or so
m2bs04p5-0000.000-0008.440 the consolidation process is gaining momentum chris anderson of the massachusetts high-tech council says you can read about it almost daily in the newspapers
m2btrlp1-0000.000-0004.330 more than half of america youngsters have had sexual intercourse by the time theyre seventeen
m2btrlp1-0004.330-0010.010 and many seldom use birth control according to a recent lewis-harris poll sponsored by planned parenthood
m2btrlp1-0010.010-0014.790 advocates of dispensing contraceptives in schools see the poll as supporting their case
m2btrlp1-0014.790-0024.340 others say easier availability of birth control for teenagers will make an alarming situation much worse the issue has already stirred heated debate in boston
m2btrlp1-0024.340-0026.270 where it bound to surface again
m2btrlp1-0026.270-0034.330 next month the superintendent of boston public schools is expected to put thumbs up or thumbs down on a proposal to establish school-based health clinics
m2btrlp1-0034.330-0040.770 that would among other things dispense birth control devices wbur margo melnicove reports
m2btrlp2-0000.000-0005.820 if presentaj trends continue this year in massachusetts approximately fourteen thousand teenagers will become pregnant
m2btrlp2-0005.820-0010.370 three of them are these students at saint margaret hospital alternative school for pregnant teens
m2btrlp2-0010.370-0015.910 they are sixteen or seventeen years old two are from boston one is from out of town
m2btrlp3-0000.000-0011.760 this last young mother-to-be is luckier than many she and the father of her child are married and are planning for the future and even though she been sexually active since she was twelve she avoided unwanted pregnancies by using birth control pills
m2btrlp3-0011.760-0014.320 that her mother helped her get at a local hospital
m2btrlp3-0014.320-0020.770 these three young women like the idea of school-based health clinics if one had existed in their schools they say
m2btrlp3-0020.770-0025.850 they would have used it for someone to talk to about sex and for a safe place to get birth control
m2btrlp3-0025.850-0034.270 a pilot project to set up such clinics in two to four boston middle and high schools was proposed last spring by the boston student human service collaborative
m2btrlp3-0034.270-0039.890 the plan was endorsed last fall by the adolescent issue task force set up by the superintendent of schools
m2btrlp3-0039.890-0047.690 task force member mary conroy who directs family education at saint margaret was one of the few dissenting voices against the endorsement
m2btrlp4-0000.000-0015.040 these claims are disputed by the head of the task force doctor deborah prothrow-stith she says since students do use existing services school-based clinics would be an alternative rather than a duplication and she says like health care in the work place the thrust of health care in the schools
m2btrlp4-0015.040-0017.260 is to overcome access barriers
m2btrlp5-0000.000-0016.420 kids do have sex because contraceptives are or are not available according to prothrow-stith and while she does not condone sexual activity among teens she thinks medically it unfair to deny access to contraceptives to some because others object to its availability in schools on religious grounds
m2btrlp6-0000.000-0015.630 prothrow-stith points out that if school-based clinics were established parental permission would be required for students to receive each service offered and that birth control would only be a part of a comprehensive program dealing with other adolescent issues like depression suicide and eating disorders
m2btrlp6-0015.630-0020.480 she agrees with mary conroy that the roots of these problems dig deep into society
m2btrlp6-0020.480-0029.780 but while conroy strongly opposes school-based clinics as a solution calling them a bandaid that wo work prothrow-stith says both attention to teenagers immediate needs
m2btrlp6-0029.780-0033.230 as well as long range prevention and health education are needed
m2btrlp7-0000.000-0012.000 problems associated with the proposal to set up health clinics in schools are also expected to multiply if superintendent of schools laval wilson goes along with the idea next month the boston school committee religious and community leaders
m2btrlp7-0012.000-0014.340 have already come to loggerheads over the issue
m2btrlp7-0014.340-0017.170 for wbur im margo melnicove
