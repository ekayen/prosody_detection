do	0
you	0
belong	0
to	1
a	0
gun	0
club	1
or	0
you	0
uh	0

he	1
belonged	0

one	0
awhile	0
back	1
uh	0
since	0
we	0
mo[ved]	0
we've	1
only	0
been	0
here	0
in	0
texas	1
for	0
about	0
a	0
year	1

um-hum	0

uh	0
we	0
can't	0
even	0
find	0
a	0
place	0
to	0
shoot	1
just	1
for	0
target	1
practice	0

no	0
kidding	0

i'd	0
love	0
to	0
get	0
used	0
to	0
that	0
shotgun	0
we	1
traded	0
his	0
pistol	1
for	0
that	0
shotgun	1

huh	0
well	0
the	0
the	1
um	0
uh	0
clubs	1
that	0
we've	0
got	0
around	0
here	1
are	0
kind	0
of	0
expensive	1
but	0
uh	0
it's	0
well	0
worth	0
it	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
down	1
and	0
shoot	0
up	0
against	0
a	0
sand	0
bag	1
and	0
so[me]	0
targets	1
and	0
have	1
uh	0
competition	1
um	0
i've	0
never	1
really	0
joined	1
a	0
club	0
because	0
i	0
haven't	0
got	0
the	0
time	1
not	0
because	0
i	0
haven't	0
got	0
the	0
desire	1
uh	0
there's	0
an	1
annual	0
membership	0
fee	1
uh	0
that's	0
that's	0
fairly	0
high	1
plus	0
there's	0
initi[ation]	1
initiation	1
fee	0
that	1
you	1
have	0
to	0
pay	1
as	0
a	0
first	0
time	1
uh	0
uh	0
member	1

so	0
the	0
whole	0
process	1
can	0
cost	1
you	0
a	0
hundred	0
fifty	0
dollars	1
just	0
to	0
join	0
the	0
club	1
plus	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
ammunition	1
in	0
any	0
tournaments	1
that	0
you	0
would	1
join	1
in	0

yeah	0
well	0
that's	0
what	0
uh	0
my	0
husband	0
wh[en]	0
when	0
he	1
was	0
in	0
it	0
gun	1
club	0
when	0
they's	0
done	0
that	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
he	1
went	0
mostly	0
just	0
to	0
um	0
shoot	0
at	0
paper	0
targets	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
but	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
used	0
speed	1
and	0
accuracy	1
and	0
all	0
that	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
the	0
gun	0
clubs	1
serve	0
a	0
useful	0
purpose	1
in	0
fact	1
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
somehow	0
they	0
tie	1
the	0
legislation	1
into	0
not	0
only	0
when	0
you	0
buy	1
a	0
weapon	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
uh	0
show	0
that	0
you've	0
gone	0
to	0
school	1
or	0
gone	0
to	0
some	0
class	1
to	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
handle	1
that	0
weapon	0

that's	0
a	0
good	0
i've	1
never	0
thought	0
of	0
that	1

that's	0
a	0
good	0
point	1

and	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
it	0
even	1
a[fter]	0
after	0
you	0
wait	0
your	0
nine	0
days	1
if	0
you	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
hand[le]	1
it's	0
just	1
like	0
putting	1
someone	0
in	0
an	0
automobile	1
that	0
doesn't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
and	0
you	0
give	0
him	0
a	0
license	1
because	0
he	0
waited	1
nine	0
days	0

yeah	0
that	0
and	0
yeah	0

he	1
could	0
he	0
could	0
not	0
only	1
um	1
uh	0
shoot	0
himself	1
he	0
could	0
he	0
could	1
uh	0
mishandle	1
a	0
weapon	0
leave	0
it	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
let	0
a	0
child	1
get	0
at	0
it	0

and	0
well	0
we	1
uh	1
we	1
was	0
living	0
on	0
a	0
navy	0
base	0
down	0
in	0
memphis	1
and	0
uh	0
this	0
one	0
guy	0
decided	0
to	0
play	1
uh	0
lonesome	0
cowboy	1
or	0
something	1
and	0
he	0
was	0
twirling	1
his	0
gun	1
around	0
and	0
shot	1
himself	0
in	0
his	0
foot	1

wow	0
he	0
was	0
fortunate	0
he	0
could	1
he	0
could	0
of	0
hit	0
something	0
else	1

well	0
he	0
went	0
tumbling	0
down	0
the	0
steps	1
along	1
with	0
uh	0
shooting	0
his	0
foot	0
almost	0
off	1
he	0
broke	0
his	0
leg	1
and	0
a	0
collar	0
bone	1
and	0
couple	0
of	0
other	1
things	0
i'm	0
sure	0
being	0
mister	0
cowboy	1
i	0

wow	0

i	0
can't	1
remember	0
what	1
the	0
na[me]	0
term	1
was	0
going	0
around	0
it	0
was	0
about	0
four	1
to	0
five	1
years	0
ago	0

but	0
naw	1
th[e]	0
i	1
guess	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	1

about_1	0
uh	0
private	0
citizens	1
selling	1
uh	0
weapons	1
like	0
if	0
you	0
wanted	0
to	0
sell	1
your	0
pistol	0
to	0
me	1
huh	0
how	0
do	0
you	0
feel	0
about	0
that	1
do	0
you	0
believe	1
there	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
legislation	1
guiding	1
the	0
um	0
buyer	0
and	0
the	0
seller	1
and	0
or	0
do	0
you	0
believe	1
that	0
you	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
sell	0
your	0
system	1
uh	0
because	0
you	0
own	1
it	0

uh	1
that's	0
a	0
hard	1
one	0
because_1	0
we	0
did	1
that	0
but	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
there	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
some	0
rule	0
against	1
it	0
i'll	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
person	1
who	0
sells	0
the	0
gun	1
ought	1
to	0
protect	0
themself	1
because	0
if	0
that	0
gun's	0
registered	0
to	0
them	1
and	0
somebody	0
else	0
uses	0
that	0
gun	0
in	0
something	1
the	0
cops	0
are	0
gonna	0
come	0
to	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
is[n't]	0
isn't	0
there	0
a	0
way	1
to	1
um	0
to	0
deregister	1
yourself	0
after	0
you	0
register	1
a	0
gun	0

ah	0

i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	0
i've	0
only	0
had	0
one	1
gun	0
and	0

because	0
i	0
have	0

and	0
i've	0
kept	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
the	0
one	0
gun	0
that	0
was	0
in	0
my	0
name	1

yeah	0
is	0
it	0
registered	0

yeah	0
i	0

the	0
um	0
the	0
rifle	0
that	0
i've	1
got	0
is	0
not	1
registered	0

and	0
um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
why	1
i	0
never	0
registered	0
it	0
but	0
the	0
uh	0

i	0
don't	0
think	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
register	0
a	0
shotgun	0

um	0
i'd	0
i'd	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
it's	0
voluntary	0
the	0
um	0
the	0

well	0
see	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	0
has	0
a	0
thing	1
if	0
they	1
go	0
to	0
uh	0
regulating	1
uh	0
all	1
right	0
uh	0
banning	0
guns	1
o[f]	0
pri[vate]	0
private	1
pri[vate]	1
private	1
ci[tizens]	0
citizens	1

yeah	0

this	0
my	0
kid	1
is	0
jumping	1
on	0
me	0
i	0
can't	0
hardly	0
talk	1

my	0
husband	0
feels	1
that	0
they'll	0
come	0
and	0
collect	0
everybody's	0
guns	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
that	0
could	0
happen	0
it's	0
just	0
like	1
the	0
uh	0
the	0
social	0
security	0
system	1
once	1
they	1
uh	1
they	0
gave	0
everybody	0
a	0
number	1
and	0
now	1
they're	1
making	0
you	1
um	0
uh	0
get	1
one	0
at	0
at	0
birth	1

and	0
once	0
they	0
have	1
your	0
number	0
they	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
your	1
identification	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
if	0
you	1
try	1
to	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
um	0
like	1
uh	0
not	0
identify	0
yourself	0
to	0
the	0
government	1
they	0
know	0
who	0
you	0
are	1

and	0
everything	0
about	0
you	0

and	0
that's	0
true	0

uh	1
i	1
bu[t]	0
you	0
know	0
they	0
know	1
it	0
from	0
how	0
much	0
money	0
you	0
make	0
a	0
week	1
to	1
uh	0
probably	1
your	1
uh	0
my	0
kid	0
is	0
banging	0
i	0
was	0
seeing	0
what	0
they	0
was	0
banging	1
on	0
uh	0
i've	0
lost	0
my	0
train	0
of	1
thought	1
i'm	0
sorry	0

that's	0
all	0
right	0
yeah	0
you	0
were	0
talking	0
about	1
uh	0
um	0
fed[eral]	1
what	0
the	0
federal	0
government	1
knows	0
about	0
people	1

oh	0
the	0
social	0

yeah	0
they	0
pr[obably]	0
they	0
probably	0
know	0
everything	1
from	0
half	1
the	0
time	0
wh[at]	0
ho[w]	0
what	0
time	0
you	0
go	0
to	0
the	0
bathroom	1

they	0
probably	0
do	0

no	0
that's	0
that's	0
a	0
little	0
bits	0
extreme	0
but	0
they	0
could	0
know	0
anything	0
and	0
everything	1
about	0
you	0
and	0
uh	0
i'd	0
like	0
to	0
have	0
my	0
gun	1
if	0
they	0
go	0
to	0
banning	1
banning	1
them_1	0
i'd	0
lose	0
my	0
gun	1
but	0
we	0
wouldn't	0
lose	0
our	0
pis[tol]	1
or	0
ou[r]	0
shotgun	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
we're	0
wanting	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
couple	0
more	1
that	0
no	0
one	0
knows	1
about	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
uh	0

do	0
you	1
find	0
it	0
difficult	1
picking	0
up	1
uh	1
guns	1
that	1
that	0
are	0
not	0
registered	1

naw	0

no	0
i	0
don't	0
either	0
i	1
can	0
i	0
can	0
buy	1
some	0
uh	0
today	1
if	0
i	1
wanted	0
to	0
just	0
you	0
know	0
put	0
up	0
the	0
money	0

yeah	0
w[ell]	0

yes	0
well	0
you	1
can	0
look	0
in	0
the	0
uh	0
the	0
we	0
got	1
the	0
thing	0
down	1
here	0
called	0
a	0
shopper	1

uh-huh	0

it's	0
a	0
a	0
who	1
a	0
it's	0
a	0
it's	0
a	0
bargain	1
thing	0
uh	0
you	0
go	1
and	0
everyb[ody]	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
always	0
see	0
guns	1
in	0
there	0
five	0
to	0
seven	0
guns	0
a	0
day	0

yeah	0

it	0
comes	0
out	0
every	0
tuesday	1

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
no	0
waiting	0
period	0
on	0
that	1

naw	0
none	0
whatsoever	0

you	0
ca[n]	0
call	0
w[e]	0
we	0
sold	0
a	0
refrigerator	1
through	0
it	0
and	1
it	0
took	0
us	0
all	0
of	0
twelve	1
hours	0

you	0
sell	0
the	0
refrigerator	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i'm	0
sure	0
it'd	0
be	0
even	1
less	0
for	0
somebody	0
with	0
a	0
good	0
gun	1

hm	0
yeah	0
i	0
think	0
the	0
federal	0
government	1
is	0
um	0
is	0
really	0
far	0
away	1
from	0
uh	0
um	0
control	1
i	1
i	0
don't	1
believe	1
in	0
um	0
should	0
i	0
shouldn't	1
probably	0
say	0
control	1
i	0
mean	0
regulation	0
control	1
is	0
something	0
that	0
i	0
wouldn't	1
want	0
the	0
federal	0
government	1
to	0
have	1
b[ut]	0
um	0
but	0
i	0
would	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
them	0
have	1
a	0
monitoring	0
capability	1
so	0
that	0
they	0
know	1
who	0
has	1
what	0
weapons	1

yeah	0
well	0
i'll	0
agree	0
with	0
you	0
there	1
they	0
do	0
have	0
too	0
much	0
control	0
over	0
us	0
already	1

yeah	0

uh	0
we	0
could	0
look	0
at	0
our	0
paychecks	1
and	0
see	0
how	0
much	0
control	0
they	0
have	1

unfortunately	1
we	1
uh	0
we	0
vote	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
people	0
who	0
spend	0
the	0
money	1
so	0
i	0
can't	0
complain	0
too	1
much	0

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
they're	0

okay	1
do	0
you	1
vote	1
regular	0

yeah	1
i	0
do	1
i	0
try	0
and	1
vote	0
in	0
every	0
single	0
election	1

every	1
one	0

but	1
uh	1
that's	0
just	0
since	0
in	0
the	1
past	1
say	1
about	1
six	1
years	1
before	0
that	0
i	0
really	0
didn't	0
pay	0
any	0
attention	0
at	0
all	1

well	0
see	0
that's	0
me	1
i've	0
never	0
paid	0
any	0
attention	0
to	0
voting	1

oh	0
you	0
haven't	0

hum-um	0

yeah	0
i	1
didn't	0
use	0
to	0
but	0
now	0
i	0
really	0
because_1	0
i	0
get	0
so	0
angry	1
about	0
what	1
goes	0
on	1
and	0
then	0
i	0
feel	0
like	0
i	0
can't	1
really	0
complain	0
too	0
much	0
unless	1

unless	0
you	0
have	0
something	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
it	0

yeah	0

right	0

but	1
the	0
problem	0
is	0
that	1
i	0
am	1
very	1
liberal	1
politically	1
and	0
so	1
i	0
hardly	1
ever	1
have	1
anybody	0
that	0
wins	1
that	0
i	0
vote	0
for	1

oh	0
liberal	0
by	1
what	0
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	0
liberal	1
um	0

liberal	0
politically	0
i'm	0
you	0
know	0
like	0
pretty	0
left	0
wing	0
demo[crat]	0
democrat	0
so	0

well	0
see	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
anything	1
about	0
politics	1

oh	0
you	0
don't	0

uh	0
what's	0
the	1
main	0
what's	0
the	1
main	0
difference	0
between	0
republicans	0
and	0
democrats	0

okay	0
well	1
there's	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
them_1	0
um	0
[de]pends	0
on	0
what	0
issue	0
you're	0
talking	0
about	1
but	0
democrats	0
are	0
on	0
a	1
lot	0
of	0
issues	0
are	0
more	0
liberal	0
than	0
republicans	0
and	0
well	0
it	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	0
to	0
say	0
now	1
especially	0
after	0
desert	0
storm	1
but	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
back	1
in	0
the	0
eigh[ties]	1
times	1
when	0
uh	0
my	1
political	0
opinions	0
were	0
being	1
formed	0
like	0
in	0
viet[nam]	1
during	0
the	0
vietnam	0
war	0
and	0
stuff	1
the	0
republicans	0
were	1
more	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
they	0
called	0
hawks	1
which	0
is	1
more	1
like	1
aggressive	1
in	1
war	1
and	0
more	1
pro-war	1
and	0
pro-aggression	1
and	1

uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
um	0
the	0
democrats	0
were	0
the	0
doves	1
they	0
were	0
more	0
for	0
peace	1
and	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
how	0
much	0
that	0
holds	0
true	0
anymore	1
i	0
think	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
issues	0
are	0

okay	0
and	0
you	0
vote	0
for	0
the	0
democrats	1
or	0

yeah	0

usually	0

yeah	0
and	0
democrats	0
usually	0
are	0
su[pportive]	0
more	0
supportive	0
of	0
public	0
assistance	0
programs	0
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
and	0
programs	0
to	0
um	0
th[e]	0
the	0
big	0
republican	0
thing	1
is	0
that	0
they	1
don't	1
they	0
vote	0
for	0
less	0
government	1
they	0

um-hum	0

you	0
know	1
i	0

on	0
tv	1
about	0
them_1	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
news	1
or	0
on	0

of	0
just	0

okay	0
i	0
don't	0
remember	0
anything	0
about	0
dukakis	1

you	0
don't	0

but	1
well	0
they're	0
all	0
saying	0
that	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
you	0
know	1
whatever	0
is	0
best	1
for	0
their	0
campaign	0
anyway	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1
if	0
they	0
had	0
some	0
kind	0
of	0
public	0
programs	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
just	0
go	0
out	1
and	0

um-hum	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
like	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
school	0
they	0
didn't	0
teach	0
you	0
about	1
demo[crats]	1
uh	0
the	0
government	1
not	0
really	1

right	0

you	0
didn't	0
get	0
any	0
government	0
classes	1

hum-um	0

yeah	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	1
too	0
because	0
before	1
they	0
used	0
to	0
have	1
um	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it	0
seems	0
like	0
the	0
stuff	0
that	0
they	0
put	0
out	0
now	1
it	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
doesn't	0
just	0
seem	0
like	1
it	0
i	0
know	0
for	0
a	0
fact	0
that	0
the	1
any	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	1
that	0
if	0
you	1
wrote	0
and	0
asked	0
for	0
material	1
well	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
believe	1
in	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
believe	0
in	1
they	0
don't	0
take	0
any	0
stands	0
on	0
anything	1
they	0
kind	0
of	0
say	1
well	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
want	1
me	0
to	0
believe	0

yeah	0

or	0
they	0
word	1
it	0
so	0
that	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
tell	1
where	0
they're	0
standing	0
on	0
certain	0
issues	1

well	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
they're	0
yeah	0
i	0
know	0
how	0
they	0
do	0
it	1
it	0

um-hum	0

it	0
like	0
i[t]	0
with	0
the	0
abortion	0
issues	0
and	0
stuff	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
kind	0
of	0
take	0
a	0
stand	0
on	0
some	1
things	0
like	0
abortion	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
so	0
that's	0
kind	1
of	0
how	0
i	0
judge	1
there's	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
where	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	1
like	0
abortion	1
or	0
gun	0
control	1
or	0
let	0
me	0
see	0
i	0
try	0
to	0
look	1
at	0
what	1
if	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
newspaper	0
articles	1
or	0
the	1
i	0
don't	0
trust	0
tv	0
as	0
much	1
but	0
newspaper	0
articles	1
can	1
show	1
wheth[er]	0
how	0
they	0
voted	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
and	0
but	0
you	0
get	0
you	0
know	0
it	0

right	0

it	0
all	0
depends	0
again	1
on	0
whose	0
writing	1
it	0
and	0
who	0
they're	0
for	1
because	0
they	0
can	0
slant	0
that	0
too	1

right	0
and	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
poli[ticians]	0
the	0
politicians	0
i'm	0
the	0
also	0
the	0
politicians	1
put	0
out	0
what	0
makes	0
them_1	0
look	0
good	0
anyway	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
everybody's	1
got	1
you	0
know	1
stuff	0
they	0
don't	0
want	0
known	1

right	0
everybody's	0
got	0
a	0
secret	1
so	0

well	0
anyway	1
i'm	0
sorry	0
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	0
have	1
much	0
knowledge	1

well	0
that's	0
okay	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
um	0

i	0
don't	0
even	0
remember	0
this	0
being	0
on	0
there	1

i	0
mean	1
what	0
would	0
it	0
take	1
like	1
that	1
this	0
is	0
really	0
good	1
actually	1
tha[t]	0
for	1
to	0
talk	0
to	0
somebody	0
who	0
hasn't	0
voted	1
i	0
mean	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0

incentive	0

how	0
would	0
it	1
how	1
what	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	0
would	0
they	1
would	0
you	0
like	0
them	0
to	0
do	1
so	0
that	1
that	1
you	0
would	0
know	0
more	0
about	0
it	1
like	0
send	0
stuff	0
in	0
the	0
mail	0
or	0
have	0
it	0
at	0
the	0
library	0
or	0

i	0
guess	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
good	0
now	0
i'm	0
sure	0
they've	0
got	0
it	0
at	0
the	0
library	1
you	1
know	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0
if	0
i	0
get	0
to	0
the	0
library	1
i've	0
got	0
two	0
babies	1
so	0
i	0

i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0

or	1
do	0
you	0
just	0
not	1
do	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
it's	0
not	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
make	0
that	0
much	0
difference	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
vote	1
or	0

oh	0
i	0
know	0
if	0
enough	0
people	0
think	0
like	0
that	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
would	0
make	0
a	0
difference	0
if	0
people	0
stopped	0
thinking	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

yeah	0

um	0
well	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
they'll	0
vote	1
the	0
way	0
their	0
family	1
votes	0
you	0
know	1
if	0

uh-huh	0

if	0
since	0
you're	1
what	0
democrat	1
th[en]	1
then	1
like	0
your	0
kids	0
or	0
whatever	0
will	0
follow	0
you	1
and	0
just	0
vote	0
democrat	1
right	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

right	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	0

well	0
not	0
in	0
my	0
family	0

no	0

we're	0
kind	1
of	0
really	0
independent	1

all	0
split	0

but	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
families	0
do	1
that	1
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
wives	0
feel	1
like	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
vote	0
the	0
way	0
that	0
their	0
husbands	0
vote	1

right	0

and	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
keeps	0
from	0
getting	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
issues	0
resolved	1
golly	0

i	0
lie	0
hm	0

but	0
well	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	1
did	0
understand	0
politics	1
i	0
probably	0
would	0
vote	0
more	1

um-hum	0

but	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
if	0
i	0
voted	0
for	0
bush	0
or	0
like	1
when	0
uh	0
gary	1
hart	0
was	0
running	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
women	0
would	0
have	0
voted	0
for	0
him	1
just	0
because	0
he	0
was	0
nicer	0
looking	1
not	0

hart	0

uh-huh	0

not	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
was	0
good	0
looking	0
but	0
he	0
was	0
young	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

and	0
then	1
i	0
didn't	0
think	0
that	0
was	0
right	1
because	0
he	0
may	0
have	0
been	0
a	1
good	0
president	0
or	0
whatever	1

um-hum	0

but	0
because	0
it	0
was	1
he	0
had	0
an	0
affair	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
it	1
just	0
threw	0
him	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
whole	1
running	0

yeah	0

and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
go	0
by	1
their	1
uh	0
personal	0
life	0
when	0
they	0
vote	1
and	0

um-hum	0
yeah	0

which	0
i	0
guess	0
if	0
you	0
got	0
turmoil	0
in	0
your	1
personal	0
life	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
let	1
it	0
come	0
into	0
work	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
that	0
have	1
had	0

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
everybody	0
does	0
it	0
just	0
depends	0
on	0
how	0
well	0
you	0
can	0
hide	1
it	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i	0
that's	0
very	0
true	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
doesn't	0
really	0
have	0
that	0
much	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
um	0
unless	0
they've	0
done	0
something	0
really	0
horrible	1
you	0
know	1
or	0
something	0
real	0
abnormal	1

well	0

criminal	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that's	0
different	0
but	0

yeah	0
right	0

but	0
if	0
him	0
and	0
his	0
wife	0
weren't	0
getting	0
along	1
i	0

but	0
otherwise	0

um-hum	0

i	0
mean	1
what	0
is	1
what	0
effect	0
does	0
that	0
have	0
on	0
him	0
running	0
for	0
president	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i	0
mean	1

yeah	0
yeah	0

it's	0
all	0
so	0
secretive	0
see	0
we	0
really	0
don't	0
see	1
the	0
true	0
person	1
anyway	0

that's	0
right	0

i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	0
having	0
a	0
big	0
effect	0
on	0
how	1
poorly	0
that	0
the	0
country's	0
being	0
run	1
is	0
that	1
um	0
the	1
the	0
election	1
the	0
people	0
that	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
elected	1
are	0
turning	0
it	0
into	0
a	0
popularity	0
contest	1
by	0
advertising	0
the	0
things	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
that	0
really	0
don't	0
have	0
anything	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
how	0
well	0
they	0
do	0
the	0
job	1

right	0

but	0
see	0
they're	0
trying	0
to	0
find	0
an	0
excuse	1
not	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
what	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
issues	0
that	0
people	0
really	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
about	1
because	1
on	0
those	0
issues	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
don't	0
say	0
yes	0
or	0
no	0
then	1
maybe	0
somebody'll	0
vote	0
for	0
them_1	0
that	0
wouldn't	0
have	1
if	0
they	0
had	0
come	0
down	0
on	0
the	0
wrong	0
side	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
so	0

right	0

so	0
they	0
just	0
try	0
and	0
make	0
it	0
a	0
personal	0
thing	0
i	0
mean	0
if	0
you	0
remember	1
any	0
of	0
the	0
tv	0
commercials	1
from	0
the	0
last	0
presidential	0
campaign	1
they	0
all	0
had	1
uh	0
pictures	0
of	0
bush	0
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
walking	0
around	0
with	0
his	0
grandchildren	1
and	1
even	0
from	0
reagan	0
it	0
was	0
all	0
just	0
like	1
looks	0
like	0
a	0
mcdonald's	0
commercial	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	0

that's	0
about	0
what	0
it	0
looked	1
like	0

well	1
what	0
did	0
you	0
think	0
of	0
reagan	0
as	0
a	0
president	1

i	0
just	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
really	0
inept	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
he	0
did	0
anything	0
at	0
all	1
he	1
they	0
just	1
kind	0
of	0
sat	0
him	0
up	0
there	0
like	0
a	0
puppet	1
and	0
the	0
people	0
that	0
were	0

do	0
you	0
think	0
he	0
won	0
from	0
carter	1
because	0
of	0
the	1
um	0
the	1
hostages	0
that	0
were	0
held	1
at	0
that	0
time	1

well	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
was	1
part	0
of	0
it	1
i	0
think	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
the	0
the	0
economic	0
problems	0
that	0
the	0
country	0
was	0
having	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
the	0
the	0
recession	0
and	0
stuff	0
people	0

um-hum	0

people	0
just	0
had	0
a	0
picture	0
of	0
carter	0
as	0
not	0
being	0
real	0
capable	1
but	0
he	0
actually	0
all	0
right	0
this	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	0

i	0
thought	0
carter	0
was	0
good	0
too	1
and	0
that	0
was	0
yeah	0

did	0
you	0
i	0
always	0
liked	0
him	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
was	0
great	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
couldn't	0
get	0
over	0
the	0
fact	0
that	0
reagan	0
beat	0
him	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
i	0
just	0
couldn't	0
believe	0
that	0
he	0
got	0
voted	0
out	1

but	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
wasn't	0
well	0
let's	0
see	0
that's	0
been	0
about	0
ten	0
years	0
ago	0
right	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0

okay	0
so	0
i	0
was	0
only	0
fifteen	0
or	0
sixteen	1
but	0
i	0
remember	0
carter	0
and	0
i	0
liked	0
him	0

you	0
did	0
have	0
you	0
heard	0
stuff	0
about	0
him	0
lately	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
he's	0
doing	1

no	0
i	0
sure	0
don't	0

well	0
he	0
is	0
just	1
he	0
is	0
really	0
active	0
still	0
politically	1
he's	0
been	0
overseas	0
you	0
remember	0
when	0
he	0
was	0
in	0
office	1
he	0
did	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
stuff	1
for	0
the	0
middle	1
ea[st]	0
for	1
pe[ople]	0

the	1
aids	1
issue	1
is	1
is	1
a	1
bit	0
of	0
a	1
problem	1
i	0
guess	0
the	0
first	0
thing	0
that	1
comes	0
to	1
my	1
mind	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
immediate	1
friends	0
with	0
that	1
problem	0
is	1
is	1
the	1
financial	1
end	1
i	1
mean	1
how	1
can	1
a	1
country	1
stand	1
to	0
uh	1
spend	0
as	1
much	1
or	1
much	0
more	1
than	0
they	1
already	1
are	0
on	0
such	0
a	0
problem	1
uh	0
but	0
then	1
that	1
kind	0
of	1
thinking	0
is	0
also	1
tempered	1
with	0
the	1
the	1
knowledge	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
the	0
the	1
rumor	1
i'm	0
not	1
really	1
sure	0
if	0
it's	1
true	0
or	1
not	1
that	1
uh	0
we're	1
not	0
spending	1
as	0
much	1
per	1
let's	0
say	1
afflicted	0
person	1
on	0
cancer	1
uh	0
there's	0
some	1
uh	0
take	0
breast	1
cancer	0
for	0
instance	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
be	1
doing	0
much	0
more	1
damage	1
and	1
affecting	0
much	0
more	0
peo[ple]	1
mean	1
more	0
people	0
than	0
aids	1
and	0
yet	1
uh	0
more	0
people	0
die	1
of	0
it	1
and	0
yet	0
the	0
funding	1
is	0
already	1
uh	0
exceeded	1
aids	0
has	0
more	0
money	1
than	0
uh	0
breast	1
cancer	0

and	1
well	0
that's	1
interesting	0
isn't	0
it	1
yeah	0

so	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	0
if	0
it's	1
true	1
i	0
i've	1
i've	0
always	0
heard	1
these	0
things	0
i've	1
never	0
bothered	1
to	1
dig	1
it	0
out	0
and	0
make	0
sure	1
but	0
uh	0
i've	0
heard	0
it	0
on	1
more	0
than	0
one	0
documentary	1
that	1
uh	0
they	0
were	0
complaining	1
that	1
whoever's	0
sitting	0
up	1
there	0
making	0
these	0
decisions	1
uh	0
or	0
whatever	1
institutions	0
raise	0
the	0
money	1
and	0
uh	1
it's	0
just	0
one	0
big	0
pr	0
campaign	1
that	0
yeah	0
we	0
think	0
that's	0
the	0
world's	0
worst	0
thing	1
so	0
let's	0
give	0
money	0
to	0
aids	1
and	0
yet	0
we've	0
had	0
breast	0
cancer	0
problems	0
for	0
years	1

right	1

and	1
it's	0
just	0
one	1
of	0
those	0
well	0
of	0
course	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
shows	1
i	0
saw	0
was	0
taking	0
it	0
from	1
the	0
angle	1
that	0
since	0
it	0
doesn't	0
effect	0
men	1
it's	0
not	0
gonna	0
get	0
funded	1
and	1
uh	0
having	0
thought	1
about	0
that	1
for	0
a	0
while	0

what	0
did	0
you	1
think	0
about	0
that	1
idea	0

well	1
i	1
i	0
kind	1
of	0
i	0
thought	1
well	1
that	0
that	1
might	0
be	0
possible	0
since	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
men	0
in	0
control	1
of	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
but	0
then	0
i	0
go[t]	1
i	0
got	0
to	0
thinking	1
the	0
the	0
number	0
one	0
killer	0
of	0
men	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
prostate	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
one	0
test	1
that	0
just	1
recently	1
got	0
developed	1
uh	0
a	0
blood	0
an[tigen]	1
antigen	1
uh	0
antibody	0
test	1
for	0
the	0
antigen	0
in	0
the	0
blood	1
and	0
that's	0
fairly	0
recent	1
and	0
yet	0
men	1
have	0
been	0
dying	0
from	0
prostate	0
cancer	0
for	0
years	1

they've	0
not	0
really	0
given	0
it	0
attention	1
either	1
yeah	1

so	1
it's	1
not	0
really	0
cure	0
f[or]	0
yeah	1
it's	1
not	0
uh	0
not	0
that	0
heavily	0
funded	0
either	1
and	0
that	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
the	0
major	1
uh	0
problems	1
that	0
men	1
have	0
in	0
the	0
realm	0
of	0
cancer	0
so	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
guess	0
there's	0
just	0
some	0
strange	1
public	0
opinion	1
as	0
to	0
who	0
they	1
want	0
to	0
give	0
to	0
um	0
be	1
it	0
through	1
different	0
organizations	1
march	0
of	0
dimes	0
type	1
uh	0
telethons	1
or	0
or	0
bicycle	1
rides	0
or	0
whatever	1
how	0
they	0
fund	1
whatever	1
um	0
illness	0
they	0
wish	1

right	1

it's	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1
to	0
to	0
get	0
an	0
even	0
keel	1
on	0
that	1
i	0
mean	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
say	1
well	1
there's	1
you	0
know	0
a	0
hundred	0
thousand	1
per	0
year	0
affected	0
by	0
this	1
one	0
so	0
let's	0
give	0
it	0
this	0
amount	1
and	0
then	0
this	0
other	0
one's	0
only	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	0
so	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	0
and	1
and	0
just	0
keep	1
doling	0
it	0
out	0
that	1
way	0
or	0

well	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
glad	0
i'm	0
not	1
the	0
one	0
that's	1
that's	0
in	0
charge	1
of	1
of	1
making	0
those	1
decisions	1
they	0
uh	1
you	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
could	0
just	0
be	0
money	0
for	0
all	1
these	0
problems	1
because_1	0
they're	1
all	1
so	0
serious	1
you	1
know	1
i	0
mean	1
it's	0
not	0
so	0
serious	1
i	1
guess	1
until	1
it	0
affects	0
your	0
family	1
and	1
then	0
all	1
the	1
sudden	1
it's	0
the	0
most	1
important	0
thing	0

right	1

so	1
i	0
i	0
would	1
hate	1
to	0
have	0
that	0
responsibility	0
just	0
personally	1
but	1
but	0
then	0
again	1
we	0
really	1
we	0
really	0
do	1
have	0
it	1
as	0
a	0
society	1
just	0
decides	0
which	1
things	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
address	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
guess	0
i	1
it	1
it	1
frightens	1
me	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
so	0
many	0
people	0
with	1
with	1
aids	0
and	0
with	1
cancer	1
and	1
many	1
of	0
those	0
things	0
um	0
if	0
they're	0
not	0
able	1
to	0
to	0
be	0
insured	1
then	0
the	0
country's	1
gonna	0
pay	0
for	1
it	0
one	1
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
whether	1
it's	0
through	0
prevention	1
or	0
or	1
treatment	1
or	1
you	1
know	1
just	1
uh	0
just	0
helping	1
the	0
people	1
when	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	0
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
themselves	1

right	1

it	0
seems	0
like	0
one	1
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
we're	0
gonna	0
end	0
up	0
paying	1
for	0
it	0

that's	0
true	1

just	1

you	0
know	1
the	1
the	0
other	1
thought	0
that	0
i	0
had	1
um	0
i've	0
had	1
several	0
minutes	0
to	0
think	1
about	0
this	0
after	1
i	0
uh	0
while	0
i	0
was	0
finding	1
people	0
i	1
uh	0
i	0
could	0
think	0
about	0
the	0
topic	1
longer	0
than	0
the	0
person	0
that	0
receives	1
it	0
so	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
a	0
unfair	0
advantage	1
as	0
they	0
were	0
but	0

but	0
the	0
other	0
thing	0
that	0
i've	0
thought	0
of	0
on	0
this	1
is	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
there	0
isn't	1
enough	0
money	1
uh	0
in	0
our	0
economy	1
or	0
in	0
our	0
system	0
uh	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
there's	0
so	0
much	1
that	0
goes	1
to	0
things	0
that	0
don't	0
really	1
do	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	0
of	0
good	0
i	0
mean	1
yeah	1
they're	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
but	1
we	0
have	0
such	0
an	0
affluent	0
[s]ociety	1
society	1
that	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
if	0
we	1
took	0
a	0
little	1
from	0
here	0
and	0
there	0
and	0
the	0
other	0
if	0
we	0
might	1
wind	1
up	0
with	0
a	0
uh	0
cure	0
for	0
just	0
about	0
everything	1
of	0

just	1
change	1
our	0
p[riorities]	0

of	0
course	0
then	0
we	0
wouldn't	0
have	0
any	0
room	0
to	0
put	0
people	1
but	1
that's	0

right	1
just	1
change	0
our	0
priorities	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
you	0
hear	0
these	0
ridiculous	0
figures	0
for	0
pizza	1
or	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
these	0
phenomenal	1
amount	0
of	0
dollars	1
spent	0
for	0
this	0
that	0
or	0
the	0
other	0
and	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
all	1
the	0
arts	1
that	0
that	0
are	0
nice	0
and	0
aesthetic	1
but	0
are	0
they	1
that	1
enhancing	0
for	0
the	1
m[asses]	0
for	0
the	1
masses	1
you	0
know	1
they	0

right	1

they	0
certainly	0
do	0
well	1
for	0
those	0
who	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
symphony	0
orchestra	0
and	0
all	0
that	1
but	0
uh	0
had	0
all	0
that	0
donation	1
and	0
time	1
and	0
labor	0
and	0
effort	1
gone	0
toward	0
something	0
else	1

okay	1
well	1
like	0
i	1
was	1
saying	1
burlington's	0
crime	1
it	1
doesn't	0
involve	0
children	1
and	0
what	0
you	0
see	0
on	0
the	1
tv's	1
from	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
washington	1
and	0
new	1
york	1
so	0
what	0
i	0
believe	1
the	1
people	1
want	1
the	0
subject	1
is	1
is	1
big	0
city	0
crime	1
which	1
is	0
something	1
that	0
i	0
don't	0
have	0
any	0
first	0
hand	0
experiences	1
about	0
but	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
concerns	1
and	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
few	1
ideas	1
of	1
um	0
how	0
to	0
combat	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
uh	0
ideally	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
need	0
money	1
to	0
do	0
everything	1
so	0
that's	0
one	0
thing	1
that	1

um-hum	0

that	1
that's	1
one	0
thing	1
that	0
that's	0
that's	1
crime	1
that	0
you	1
can't	0
fight	1
it	0
if	0
you	1
need	0
that	1
money	1
so	0

right	0
yeah	0
well	0
when	1
uh	0
we	1
lived	0
in	0
san	0
antonio	1
i	1
grew	1
up	0
around	1
san	0
antonio	0
and	1
it's	1
always	1
been	0
a	1
very	0
large	1
uh	0
city	1
and	0
increasingly	0
growing	1
it's	0
has	1
kind	0
of	1
the	0
split	0
population	1
um	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
retired	0
military	1
uh	0
individuals	1
that	0
live	0
there	0
and	0
then	0
there's	0
a	0
very	0
large	0
hispanic	1
population	0
there	1
and	0
the	0
one	0
thing	0
that	0
we	1
noticed	0
that	1
over	0
the	1
years	1
has	0
gotten	0
worse	0
and	0
worse	1
is	0
hispanic	1
uh	1
gang	0
crime	1
in	0
the	0
city	1

oh	0

and	0
that	1
is	0
uh	0
been	0
the	0
worse	1
thing	0
that	0
we've	0
seen	0
happening	0
uh	0

does	0
it	1
spread	0
out	1
of	1
the	0
neighborhoods	1
into	0
the	1
more	1
the	0
uh	0
retired	1
people's	1
community	0
or	1
does	0
it	0
stay	1
in	1
the	0
bad	0
neighborhood	1

um	0
the	0
majority	1
of	0
the	0
actual	0
gang	1
crimes	1
like	0
the	1
the	0
drive	0
by	0
shootings	1
and	1
stuff	0
stays	0
in	0
the	0
neighborhoods	1
but	0
the	0
crime	1
spreads	0
out	0
into	0
the	0
more	0
affluent	1
uh	0
divisions	1
through	0
robberies	1
rape	1
and	0
uh	0
car	1
crime	0
there's	0
a	0
very	0
large	1
uh	0
or	0
very	0
high	1
percentage	0
of	0
car	1
theft	1
and	1
san	1
an[tonio]	0
san	0
antonio's	0
not	0
far	1
from	0
the	0
border	0
to	0
mexico	1
so	1
a	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
uh	0
cars	1
go	0
to	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
hack	1
shops	0
and	0
they	0
take	0
them_1	0
apart	1
and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
them_1	0
go	0
over	0
the	0
border	1
especially	0
like	0
mercedes	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
those	0
those	1
in	0
the	0
the	0
z	1
uh	0
the	0
z	1
cars	0
the	0
datsun	1
cars	0
end	0
up	0
over	0
the	0
border	1
and	0
uh	0

so	0
that's	0
a	1
big	0
concern	1
if	0
you	0
live	0
there	1
is	0
to	1
really	0
lock	1
your	0
car	1
up	0

very	0
much	0
so	0

very	0
much	0
so	0
in	0
fact	1
um	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
there	1
uh	0
they	0
had	1
downtown	1
if	0
you	1
were	0
to	1
co[me]	0
come	0
to	0
a	0
stop	1
light	0
they	0
had	1
a	0
a	0
rash	1
of	0
where	0
people	0
were	0
uh	0
when	0
people	0
were	0
stopped	0
at	0
stop	1
signs	0
that	0
people	1
would	0
get	0
in	0
their	0
car	1
and	0
hold	0
a	0
knife	1
and	0
hold	0
them	0
up	1
so	0
now	1
uh	0
ever	0
since	1
then	0
when	0
you	0
drive	0
into	0
the	0
city	1
most	0
people	0
keep	0
their	0
doors	0
locked	1
while	0
they're	0
in	1
the	0
car	0
until	0
they	0
get	0
down	1
there	0
and	0
uh	0
once	0
you've	0
reached	1
the	0
the	0
river	1
walk	0
area	0
which	0
is	0
the	0
tourist	1
area	0
it's	0
usually	1
pretty	0
safe	1
during	0
th[e]	0
during	0
the	0
day	1
if	0
you're	0
just	0
kind	0
of	0
cautious	1
and	0
don't	0
go	0
down	0
the	0
back	1
streets	0
or	0
alleys	1
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
or	0
or	0
alone	1
if	0
you	0
stay	0
with	0
the	0
groups	1
and	0
along	0
the	0
area	0
where	0
they	0
have	1
th[e]	0
the	0
river	0
patrol	1
cops	0
it's	0
very	0
nice	1
but	0
at	0
at	0
evening	1
um	0
again	1
you	0
they	0
have	0
the	0
high	0
tourist	1
area	0
the	0
river	1
walk	0
area	0
which	0
is	0
nice	1
but	0

i	0
rea[lly]	0

don't	0
know	1
how	1
to	0
make	0
it	0

much	0
when	0
we	0
moved	0
here	0
to	0
monterrey	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
big	0
change	1
because	0
it's	0
such	0
a	0
small	1
community	0
we're	0
just	0
above	0
carmel	1
and	1
um	0
there's	0
hardly	1
most	0
everybody	0
seems	0
pretty	0
well	0
employed	1
around	0
here	1
and	0
um	0
those	0
that	0
aren't	0
there's	0
celinas	1
which	0
is	0
about	0
a	0
fifteen	0
minute	0
drive	1
which	0
is	0
mostly	0
migrant	1
workers	0
and	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
crime	0
there	1
um	0
migrant	0
hispanic	0
farm	0
workers	0
uh	0
people	0
that	0
are	0
down	0
and	0
out	0
and	0
uh	0
they	0
all	0
seem	0
to	0
congregate	0
in	0
celinas	0
not	0
so	0
much	0
here	0
in	0
monterrey	0
so	0
it's	0
it's	0
pretty	0
quiet	0
i've	0
bee[n]	0
you	0

you	0
would	0
uh	0
someone	0
might	0
grab	1
you	0

around	0

you	0
but	0
they're	0

life	1

the	0
buick	1
was	1
was	1
great	1
it	0
was	0
nine	0
years	0
old	1
and	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
still	1
going	0
strong	1
and	1

really	1

the	0
only	1
problems	1
i	0
had	0
had	0
with	0
it	1
in	0
nine	0
years	0
that	0
i	0
owned	1
it	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
replace	0
the	0
compressor	1
when	0
it	0
was	0
about	1
seven	0
years	0
old	1

really	1

and	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
only	1
major	0
problem	0
that	0
i	0
had	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
had	0
little	1
piddly	0
things	1
like	1
i	0
had	0
to	0
replace	0
the	0
muffler	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
had	1
replaced	0
the	0
tires	1
and	1
uh	1
seems	0
like	1
it	1
had	0
a	0
radiator	0
leak	0
once	1
but	0
i	0
never	0
had	0
any	1
major	1
anything	1
other	0
than	0
the	0
compressor	1

right	0

i	0
never	0
really	0
had	0
anything	0
major	0
with	0
my	0
mazda	1
but	1
it	0
was	1
a	0
standard	0
also	1
and	0
the	0
clutch	0
went	0
out	0
on	1
it	0
toward	0
the	0
end	1
i	0
had	0
it	0
five	0
years	1
and	1
the	0
last	1
year	0
or	0
last	0
two	0
years	1
it	0
seemed	0
to	0
go	0
out	1
really	1
easily	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
went	0
out	0
twice	1
in	0
two	0
years	1
and	0
that's	1
that's	0
a	0
lot	1
it	0
shouldn't	0
go	0
out	0
that	0
much	1

no	1
hm	1

and	1
so	0
i	0
went	0
ahead	0
and	0
bought	0
another	1
standard	1
when	0
i	0
bought	0
the	0
honda	1
but	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
i'm	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
that	0
again	1
i	0
think	0
i'm	0
going	0
back	0
to	1
automatic	0
now	1

well	1
i	0
never	1
w[ell]	1
well	0
i	0
kind	0
of	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	0
standard	1
but	1
i've	0
never	0
owned	0
one	1
so	0
i	0
had[n't]	1
i	0
don't	0
drive	0
one	0
a	0
lot	1

right	1

so	0
i	0
don't	1
f[eel]	0
feel	0
comfortable	0
in	0
traffic	0
with	0
it	1

right	1

and	1
for	0
everything	0
i've	0
heard	1
it's	0
a	0
lot	0
easier	0
to	0
sell	0
an	0
automatic	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1

and	1
and	0
resale	0
value	1
is	0
really	0
important	0
to	0
me	1

that's	0
true	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1
me	0
too	1
that's	0
why	0
i	0
got	0
the	0
honda	1

yeah	0

hondas	0
have	0
great	0
resale	1
value	0

yeah	0

the	0
mazda	1
definitely	0
did	0
not	1
not	0
at	0
all	1
they're	0
worse	0
than	0
american	1
cars	0
i	0
think	0
or	0
just	0
as	0
bad	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
resale	1
goes	0

i	0
did	0
pretty	0
well	0
with	0
my	1
uh	0
regal	1
because	0
it	0
was	0
in	0
really	0
good	0
shape	1
but	0
it	0
still	1
looked	0
real	1
nice	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
interior	1
was	0
still	0
really	1
nice	1
there	0
[what'n/wasn't]	0
cracks	1
all	0
over	0
the	0
dash	0
board	0
and	0
stuff	1
an[d]	1

right	1

and	0
it	0
had	0
some	1
some	0
nice	0
features	1
so	0
i	0
ended	0
up	0
okay	1
with	0
the	0
buick	1

good	1

and	0
i	0
anticipate	0
the	0
same	0
thing	0
with	0
the	0
honda	1
whenever	0
i	0
decide	0
to	1
sell	1
it	0
course	1
i	0
may	0
never	0
sell	1
it	0

right	1

i	0
may	0
drive	0
it	0
till	0
it's	0
dead	1
but	1

yeah	1
that's	0
what	0
i	0
did	0
with	0
the	0
mazda	1
drive	0
it	0
till	1
the	0
till	0
the	0
clutch	0
went	0
out	1
and	0
the	0
wheels	0
fell	0
off	1
so	1

yeah	0

so	1
probably	0
what	0
i'll	0
do	0
again	1

yeah	0

but	0
i	0
really	0
like	0
the	0
hondas	1
i	0
like	0
foreign	0
cars	1
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	1

yeah	0

i	1
looked	0
at	0
the	0
mitsubishi	0
galant	1
i	0
was	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
four	0
door	0
car	1
having	0
driven	1
the	0
rx	0
seven	0
so	0
long	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
it	1
was	0
so	0
small	1
and	0
it's	0
really	0
impractical	1
so	0
i	0
wanted	0
something	0
with	0
a	0
real	1
trunk	0
and	0
four	0
doors	1
something	0
easy	0
to	0
get	0
in	0
and	0
out	1
of	0
and	0
i	0
looked	0
at	0
the	1
galant	1
and	1
those	0
were	0
really	0
nice	1
and	1
you	0
can	1
get	0
them_1	0
for	0
a	1
great	0
price	1

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
found	0
it	0
hard	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
the	1
dealership	0
i	0
was	1
going	1
through	0

oh	1

so	1
that's	0
how	0
i	0
ended	0
up	0
with	0
a	0
honda	1

i	0
wasn't	0
even	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
car	1
when	0
i	1
bought	0
this	0
car	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
thinking	0
about	0
buying	0
a	0
prelude	0
from	0
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	0
moving	1
to	0
new	0
york	0
or	0
something	1
so	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
gonna	0
sell	0
her	0
car	1
because_1	0
she	0
didn't	0
need	0
it	0
anymore	1
and	0
it	1
was	1
only	1
like	0
a	0
year	0
old	1
and	0
i	0
had	0
never	0
driven	1
uh	0
a	0
prelude	1
so	1
i	0
went	0
to	0
a	0
dealership	1
because	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
uh	0
the	0
same	0
year	1
and	0
same	0
model	0
of	0
prelude	1
on	0
their	0
used	0
car	0
lot	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
test	0
drove	1
it	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
just	1
fell	0
in	0
love	1
with	0
this	0
brand	0
new	1
white	1
prelude	1
you	0
know	1
two	0
liter	0
si	1
with	0
the	1
the	0
sun	0
roof	1
and	0
the	0
moon	0
roof	1
and	1

oh	1
yeah	0

they're	0
nice	1
i	0
think	1

and	1
i	1
i	0
bought	0
it	0
loaded	1

oh	1
yeah	0

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	0
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
loaded	1
i	1

i	0
mean	1

i	1
i	0
love	0
all	0
those	0
little	0
things	1
that	0
you	0
don't	0
need	1
but	0
they're	0
so	0
wonderful	1

yeah	0
i	1
went	0
there	1
looking	0
at	0
a	1
used	0
car	1
and	0
two	0
days	0
later	1
i	0
bought	0
this	0
car	1
i	1

i	0
felt	1
i	0
felt	0
like	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
worst	0
impulse	1
that	1
w[as]	0
that	0
was	0
the	0
largest	0
impulse	0
buy	1
i	0
had	0
ever	0
made	1
the	1

the	1
oth[er]	0
the	0
two	0
other	0
things	0
that	0
i've	0
bought	0
on	0
impulse	1
are	0
vcr	1
and	0
a	0
washer	0
and	0
dryer	1

i	0
would	0
say	1

i	0
go	0
for	0
the	0
big	0
stuff	1

yeah	0
i	0
noticed	1
mine	0
was	0
definitely	0
not	0
impulse	1
i	0
really	0
needed	0
a	0
new	0
car	1
mine	0
was	0
just	1
it's	0
getting	1
worn	1
out	0
i	0
guess	1
from	0
being	0
a	0
sports	0
car	1
i	1
drove	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
got	0
it	0
right	0
after	0
high	0
school	1
so	0
by	0
the	0
time	0
i	0
traded	1
it	0
in	0
it	0
was	0
ready	1

yeah	1
i	0
got	1
i	0
got	0
my	1
buick	0
as	0
a	0
high	0
school	1
graduation	0
gift	1

ready	0
to	0
go	1

did	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
i	0
guess	0
this	0
[what'n/wasn't]	0
really	1
an	0
impulse	1
i	0
mean	0
buying	1
it	0
right	0
then	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
right	1
quickly	0
was	0
kind	0
of	0
impulsive	1
but	1
i'd	0
been	0
thinking	0
about	0
buying	0
a	0
new	0
car	0
for	0
three	1
years	0
and	0
i	0
was	0
just	0
scared	1
to	0

right	1

i	1
was	0
scared	0
to	0
start	0
taking	0
on	0
payments	1
because	0
the	0
buick	0
was	0
long	0
since	0
paid	1
for	0

right	1
that's	0
same	0
with	0
me	1
would	0
you	0
ever	0
buy	0
a	0
used	0
car	1
for	0
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
yourself	1

buy	0
a	1
buy	1
buy	0
a	0
used	0
car	1

like	1

right	1

sure	1

i	1
i	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
buy	0
one	0
once	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
worry	0
about	1
who's	0
driven	1
them_1	0
and	0
what	0
they've	0
been	0
through	1
and	0
the	0
warranties	1
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
just	1

yeah	0

just	1
i	0
can't	0
seem	0
to	0
get	0
over	0
that	1
that	0
just	0
bothers	0
me	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
why	1

well	1
um	0
like	1
on	0
hondas	1
they	1
supposedly	1
the	0
maintenance	0
records	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
registered	1
with	0
honda	0
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
request	1
whatever	0
maintenance	0
records	1
exist	0
on	0
cars	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
have	0
them_1	0
checked	0
out	0
by	0
mechanics	1
and	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

mean	0
they	0
can't	0
stop	0
you	0
from	1
doing	1
it	0
so	0

hoping	0
that	0
they	0
do	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
honda	0
dealership	1
to	0
get	0
them_1	0
serviced	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

well	0
and	0
even	0
if	0
they	0
didn't	1
you	0
can	0
still	0
get	0
a	0
good	1
idea	0
from	0
a	1
if	0
you	1
can	0
get	0
a	0
good	0
mechanic	1
to	0
check	0
it	0
over	0
real	0
carefully	1
and	0
check	0
the	1
blocks	0
and	0
everything	1

yeah	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

well	1
i	0
guess	0
that's	0
all	1

okay	1
well	0
i	0
enjoyed	0
talking	0
to	0
you	1

i	0
enjoyed	0
talking	0
to	0
you	1

bye-bye	1

bye-bye	1

well	1
what	0
would	0
you	1
have	1
at	1
a	0
dinner	0
party	1

well	1
uh	1
lately	1
since	0
i	0
have	1
children	1
i've	0
cut	1
down	1
on	0
having	0
dinner	1
parties	1
but	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
i	0
try	1
to	1
keep	0
it	0
pretty	0
simple	1
on	0
things	0
that	0
i	0
can	0
prepare	0
ahead	0
of	0
time	1
uh	0
i	0
have	0
one	0
recipe	1
for	0
uh	0
a	1
really	0
good	1
um	0
type	0
of	1
a	1
meatball	1
it's	1
called	0
burgundy	0
meatballs	1
and	0
it's	0
made	1
with	0
r[ed]	0
red	0
wine	1
and	0
um	1

oh	1
gosh	1
that	0
sounds	1
great	1

um	1

it's	0
it's	0
really	1
good	0
and	0
you	1
can	1
make	0
it	0
ahead	0
of	0
time	1
and	1
then	1
um	0
make	0
the	1
sauce	1
when	0
you're	0
ready	1
to	1
um	0
to	0
serve	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

that's	0
one	0
of	0
my	0
favorite	0
things	1
to	0
to	0
serve	1

well	0
um	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
would	0
probably	0
depend	0
on	0
whether	0
this	1
was	1
a	0
formal	1
or	1
informal	1
dinner	0
party	1

sure	1

but	1
if	0
it	1
was	0
informal	1
my	0
first	0
choice	0
would	0
be	0
crawfish	1

oh	0
really	1
well	1
i	0
guess	0
being	0
from	1
that	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1

because	1
i	1
mean	0
crawfish	1
everybody	1
over	0
here	1
likes	0
crawfish	0
but	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i	0
wouldn't	1
have	1
to	0
worry	0
about	0
satisfying	0
my	1
guest	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
if	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
formal	1
uh	0
dinner	0
party	1
i	0
would	0
probably	0
think	0
of	0
something	0
else	1
like	0
um	0
shrimp	1
shrimp	0
fettucini	0
is	0
real	0
easy	1
to	1
um	1
make	1
and	0
everything	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
it's	0
usually	0
well	0
liked	0
by	0
people	1
i	0
guess	1
i'm	0
just	0
a	0
seafood	0
fan	1
so	0
i	0
think	0
on	0
the	0
lines	1
oh	0

well	1
how	0
do	0
you	0
make	1
how	0
do	1
you	1
you	0
cook	0
crawfish	1
i	0

i	0
in	1
fact	1
i	0
just	0
came	0
back	0
from	0
the	0
grocery	0
store	1
and	1
being	0
in	0
texas	1
we	0
don't	0
have	0
too	1
many	0
you	1
know	0
people	0
that	1
that	1
eat	1
crawfish	1
but	1
they	0
had	0
live	0
crawfish	1
on	0
sale	1

oh	0
yeah	1
um	1

um	1
you're	1
not	0
supposed	1
to	0
i	1
mean	1
you're	1
not	0
supposed	0
to	0
eat	1
them_1	1
dead	1
i	1
mean	1
well	0
you	0
eat	1
them_1	0
dead	0
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0

don't	0
buy	0
them_1	0
that	1
way	1

right	1
because_1	1
if	0
if	0
they're	0
dead	0
for	0
too	0
long	1
you	0
can	0
always	0
tell	0
whenever	1
they're	0
cooked	1
if	1
they've	1
been	1
dead	0
for	0
a	1
long	1
time	1
because_1	0
their	1
tail	1
straightens	1
out	0

uh-huh	1

and	1
you're	0
not	0
supposed	0
to	1
eat	1
those	0
because_1	1
they're	0
the	1
bad	1
for	0
you	1

okay	1
well	0
i'll	0
remember	1
that	1

yeah	1
so	1
if	0
you	0
ever	1
go	0
in	0
a	0
restaurant	1
and	0
order	1
crawfish	1
i	0
mean	1
every	0
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
you'll	0
see	1
o[ne]	0
i	0
mean	1
it	0
doesn't	0
happen	0
very	0
often	1
because	0
it's	0
just	0
an	0
accident	1
but	0
if	0
the	0
tail	0
is	0
straight	1
on	0
it	1
then	0
yeah	0
don't	0
eat	1
it	1

uh-huh	1

but	1
um	0
you	0
just	1
put	0
some	0
cajun	1
well	0
lots	0
of	1
pepper	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
you	1
just	0
boil	1
them	1
and	0
they're	0
absolutely	0
wonderful	1
but	0
there's	1
uh	1
they're	1
a	0
pain	0
to	1
peel	1
for	1
some	1
people	0
once	0
you	1
get	0
used	1
to	1
it	0
they're	1
real	1
easy	1
but	1
um	0
you	1
know	1
if	0
you	0
have	0
nails	1
or	0
anything	0
you	0
can	1
plan	0
on	1
those	0
being	1
shot	1

when	0
you	0
were	1
um	0
whe[n]	1
when	0
you	1
serve	1
it	0
do	0
you	1
shell	1
them	0
and	0
then	0
serve	0
them	0
to	1

i	1
think	1
for	0
a	0
dinner	0
party	1
i	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
it	0
depends	1

um-hum	1

like	1
if	0
like	1
my	1
age	1
if	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
bunch	0
of	0
college	0
kids	1
coming	0
over	1
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	1
no	0
i	1
they	0
would	0
shell	0
their	0
own	1
you	1

sure	1

you	1
know	0
we'd	0
just	0
have	0
crawfish	1
and	0
beer	0
or	0
something	1
but	1
um	1
if	0
it	0
was	0
more	0
formal	1
like	0
if	0
i	0
was	1
you	0
know	1
working	0
environment	1
then	1
i	0
would	0
probably	1
um	1
sh[ell]	1
shell	1
them_1	0
or	0
at	1
least	1
disconnect	0
them	0
from	0
the	0
head	1
but	0
there's	1
a	0
there's	0
a	0
big	0
thing	0
over	0
here	1
that	0
everybody	0
sucks	1
the	0
head	1

so	0
they	0
don't	0
have	0
see	1
that	0
ooh	1

so	1
um	0
it	0
it	0
would	0
just	0
depend	1
that's	0

that's	0
the	0
best	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
crawfish	1

sucking	0
the	0
head	1
but	1
um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
it	1
just	1
i[t]	1
it	0
just	0
depended	1
on	0
what	0
type	0
it	0
was	1
i	1
guess	1
but	1
you	0
can	0
buy	1
uh	1
the	0
crawfish	0
tails	1
already	0
peeled	0
an[d]	0
everything	1
and	0
usually	1
you	1
use	1
those	1
like	1
for	1
frying	1
or	1
to	0
put	0
in	0
salads	1
or	1
to	0
um	1
you	1
know	0
make	0
a	0
sauce	1
with	0
or	0
something	0
like	1
that	1
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
ahead	0
and	0
buy	1
them_1	0
cooked	1
and	0
shelled	1
and	0
they're	0
more	0
expensive	1
of	0
course	0
but	1

does	0
it	1
taste	1
a	0
lot	0
like	0
shrimp	1

um	1
yeah	0
it	0
really	0
does	1
i	0
like	0
shrimp	0
better	1

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

just	1
um	1
but	1
crawfish	1
i	1
mean	0
it	1
just	1
has	0
a	0
taste	0
of	0
its	0
own	1
it	0
also	0
depends	1
on	0
who's	0
cooking	1
it	0
and	1
how	0
much	0
seasoning	0
they	0
use	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	1
that	0
but	0

sure	1

but	0
um	0
i	0
think	0
that	1
and	0
also	1
to	0
get	1
totally	0
off	0
c[rawfish]	0
the	0
subject	0
of	0
crawfish	1
lots	0
of	0
vegetables	1
and	0
hors	0
d'oeuvres	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
that	0
really	0
helps	1

yeah	1
we	1
have	0
a	0
a	0
friend	1
another	0
couple	0
where	0
the	0
husband	0
is	0
the	0
one	0
who	0
cooks	1
all	0
the	0
time	1

and	1

that's	0
what	1
i	0
need	1

yeah	0
that's	0
what	0
i	0
wish	0
i	0
had	1
but	0
in	0
our	1
family	1
i'm	0
the	0
one	0
who	1
who	0
cooks	1
and	0
i	1
i	1
really	0
enjoy	1
it	0
it's	0
gotten	0
a	1
little	0
more	0
difficult	0
with	0
kids	1
but	1
i	0
really	0
do	0
enjoy	0
cooking	1
and	0
we	1
um	0
we	0
have	0
them	1
over	1
for	0
dinner	1
back	0

i	0
had	0
my	0
second	0
child	1

sort	0
of	0
had	0
a	0
contest	1
going	0
where	1
you	0
know	0
he	1
would	0
cook	1
and	0
then	0
the	0
next	0
time	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
my	0
turn	1
and	0
i'd	0
try	0
to	0
outdo	0
him	1
and	0
then	0
he'd	0
try	0
to	0
outdo	0
me	1
and	0

a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1

that	0
got	0
pretty	1
competitive	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
who	0
could	0
come	0
up	0
with	0
the	0
best	0
recipe	1

did	1
and	1

we	1
we	1
tried	0
to	0
be	1
fancier	1
or	0
more	0
courses	0
than	1
the	0
other	1
or	1

that	0
would	1
be	0
fun	1

or	1

was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
you	1
know	1
it	0
something	1
unique	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
then	0
we	0
got	0
into	1
different	1
um	0
themes	1
you	0
know	0
um	0
whether	0
it	0
would	0
be	1
ethnic	1
food	1
or	1
um	0
sometimes	0
it	0
would	0
be	1
um	0
oh	1
oh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
maybe	0
an	0
outdoor	0
theme	1
or	1
uh	0
uh	0
elegant	1
theme	0
or	0
you	0
know	1

uh	0
huh	1

it	0
was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1

sometimes	0
it	0
might	0
be	0
the	0
candlelight	1
and	0
sometimes	0
it	0
might	0
be	0
the	0
picnic	1
out	1
back	0
or	1
something	0

that's	0
right	1

well	1

time	0
uh	0
just	1

be	1
unfairly	0
doing	0
all	0
the	0
cooking	1
and	0
they	0
were	0
doing	0
all	0
the	0

would	0
probably	0
do	0
something	1
ridiculous	0
and	0
terrible	1
just	0
just	0
to	1
uh	0
make	0
sure	1
that	0
they	0
didn't	0

don't	0
know	0
if	0
we	0
have	0
enough	1
time	1
for	0
it	0
it's	0

oh	1

it's	0
real	0
easy	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
unique	0
things	1
in	0
this	0
like	0
a	0
pound	0
of	0
ground	0
beef	1
some	0
bread	0
crumbs	1
um	0
an	0
egg	1
um	0
um	0

is	0
something	0
different	1
um	0

a	0
little	0
bit	0
crunchy	1
you	0
need	0
to	0
chop	0
them_1	0
up	0
real	0
fine	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	1
it	0
makes	0
them	0
crunchy	1
and	0
that	0
adds	0
something	1
new	0
to	0
it	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
sauce	0
is	0
just	0
made	1
with	0
um	0
bouillon	1
cubes	1
water	1
burgundy	0
wine	1
and	1
um	0
cornstarch	1
instead	0
of	0
flour	1

um-hum	1

oh	1

so	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
thick	1
rich	0
type	0
of	0
a	0
sauce	1
it's	0
more	1
of	0
a	1
when	0
you	0
use	0
corn	0
starch	1
in	0
in	0
gravy	1
like	0
you	0
know	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
um	0
chinese	1
food	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
gravy	1
or	0
a	0
sauce	1
that	0
comes	0
with	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
that	1

corn	0
starch	0
instead	0
of	0
flour	1
in	0
all	0
of	0
their	0
sauces	0
and	0
gravies	1

um-hum	1

and	0
it	0
gives	0
it	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
different	0
consistency	1

well	0
um	0
how	0
long	0
do	0
you	1
cook	0
the	0
meatballs	1

the	0
meatballs	0
you	0

sides	1
and	0

uh	0

then	0
drain	0

all	0
the	0
grease	1
uh	0

is	0
i	0
freeze	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you're	0
ready	1
to	0
serve	1
them	0
then	0
you	0
cook	0
the	0
sauce	1
and	0
then	0
put	0
the	0
meatballs	0
into	1
the	0
sauce	0
and	0
heat	1

up	0
for	0
a	0
good	1
oh	1
if	0
