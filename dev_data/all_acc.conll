have	1
a	1
waiting	1
period	1
on	1

hm	0

i	1
think	1
they	0
need	1
that	1
uh	1
now	0
i	1
do	1
have	1
a	1
i	0
have	1
a	1
pistol	1
it's	0
a	1
little	0
twenty	1
two	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
a	0
twenty	1
two	1
or	1
a	1
twelve	1
gauge	1
shotgun	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
you	0
know	1
i	1
do	1
like	1
to	0
have	1
my	1
guns	1

uh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i'll	0
ever	1
use	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
and	1
like	0
you	1
my	1
bullets	1
to	1
my	0
little	0
pistol's	1
probably	1
uh	0
about	1
three	1
years	0
old	1
uh	1
my	1

hasn't	0
been	1

in	0
a	0
year	1
or	0

uh	0
i	0
like	0
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
where	0
handy	0

well	1
up	1
uh	1
up	1
in	1
new	0
england	1
where	0
i'm	1
from	0
uh	0
y[ou]	0
you	1
had	1
to	0
get	1
a	1
permit	1
before	1
you	1
could	1
buy	1
any	1
ammu[n]it[ion]	1
amm[unition]	1
ammunition	1
and	1
i	0
thought	1
that	0
was	1
really	0
good	0
and	1
i	0
think	1
it	1
they	0
uh	0
takes	1

takes	1
two	1
weeks	1
for	0
that	0
system	1
to	0
process	1
um	1
your	1
request	1
for	1
uh	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
gun	1
permit	1
but	1
uh	1
but	0
to	1
buy	1
ammunition	1
you	1
have	1
to	0
get	1
a	0
p[ermit]	1
permit	1
from	0
the	1
police	1
station	1
in	1
your	1
local	1
area	0
to	1
do	1
that	1

i've	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
anything	0
like	1
that	1

yeah	1
um	1

that	0
would	1
be	0
nice	0
but	1
a[nd]	1
you	1
know	1

the	1
criminals	0
that	0
are	1
going	1
to	1
get	0
their	1
guns	1
one	1
way	0
or	0
the	1
other	1

i	0
i	1
i	0
agree	0
i	0

i	0
think	1
you	0
know	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
that	0
that	0
needs	1
to	0
happen	1
is	0
uh	0
to	1
to	0
stop	1
the	0
impulse	1
buyer	1
from	0
um	0
buying	1
it	0
quickly	1
and	0
and	1
um	0
maybe	0
putting	1
a	0
week's	1
waiting	1
period	0
or	0
something	1
on	1
it	0
but	1

but	1
if	0
someone's	1
really	1
determined	1
to	1
to	1
pick	1
up	0
a	0
firearm	1
uh	0
you	0
can	0
pick	1
it	0
up	0
anyplace	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
you	1
can	0
get	1
them	1
really	1
cheap	1

i	1
know	1
i	1
i	1
uh	0
th[e]	0
i	1
had	1
a	0
waiting	1
period	0
on	0
my	1
pistol	1
because_1	0
i	1
was	0
down	1
in	0
uh	0
tennessee	1
and	1
uh	0
they	1
had	0
a	0
waiting	1
period	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
we	0
bought	1
it	0
there	1
and	0

how	0
long	1
was	1
the	1
waiting	0
period	0
out	1
there	0

about_1	1
nine	0
days	1

ah	1
that	0
wasn't	1
too	0
too	0
bad	1

no	0
no	0

because	0
i[f]	0
if	1
you're	0
gonna	1
go	1
buy	1
something	1
um	0
of	0
of	0
that	1
nature	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you're	0
gonna	1
have	1
some	1
idea	1
as	0
to	0
what	1
you're	0
gonna	0
do	1
with	0
it	0
you're	0
not	1
gonna	1
react	1
that	0
quickly	1
in	0
other	1
words	1
you	0
know	0
you	1
[d]on't	1
have	0
a	1
need	1
to	1
go	0
buy	1
a	0
gun	1
to	0
go	0
shoot	1
it	1
the	0
next	1
day	1

yeah	0
somebody	1
want	1
do	1
th[at]	1
i	1
i	1
at	0
times	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
ought	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
waiting	1
period	1
on	0
all	1
firearms	1

yeah	0
i	1
do	0
too	1
uh	0
because	1
[laughter-it]	0
doesn't	1
make	0
any	0
difference	1
uh	0
uh	0
whether	1
it's	0
a	0
pistol	1
or	1
a	1
shotgun	1
i	1
suppose	1
they	0
both	1
do	1
the	0
same	1
kind	0
of	1
job	1

shotgun	1
hurts	1
worse	1
than	0
a	0
pistol	1
does	1

uh	0
yeah	0
i	0
suppose	0
i'd	1
never	0
got	0
shot	1
with	0
either	0
one	1
but	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
um	1
i	1
think	1
you	0
could	0
recover	1
from	0
a	0
pistol	1
but	1
not	0
from	1
a	0
[laughter-shotgun]	1

a	0
shotgun's	1
got	0
too	1
much	1
of	0
a	0
spread	1
or	0
at	0
least	0
ours	0
does	0
uh	0

yeah	0

uh	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
little	1
uh	0
thing	1
on	0
the	0
bo[ttom]	0
bottom	1
of	0
th[e]	0
on	0
top	1
of	0
the	0
barrel	1
where	1
you	1
a[s]	0
you	0
turn	1
it	1

uh-huh	1

you	0
can	1
make	0
it	0
either	1
tight	0
or	0
[laughter-as]	1
loose	0
as	1
loose	0
can	1
get	0

oh	0

and	0
the	1
spread	1
changes	1

uh	0
i've	1
got	0
a	0
a	1
manual	1
singled	1
shot	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
doesn't	1
have	0
any	1
any	1
automatic	1
features	1
to	0
it	0
the	1
further	1
away	1
i	0
get	1
the	0
the	1
uh	0
wider	1
the	0
shot	1
gets	0
from	0
the	1
target	1

yeah	1

and	0
the	0
closer	0
that	1
i	1
get	0
the	0
tighter	0
that	1
it	0
gets	1
it's	1
got	1
a	0
hell	1
of	0
a	1
kick	1
to	1
it	0

yeah	0
my	0
husband	1
had	0
a	0
uh	0
a	1
police	1
gun	1
at	0
one	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
shot	1
that	0
thing	0
one	0
time	1
almost	0
knocked	0
me	0
down	0

it	0
was	0
just	0
a	0
little	0
i	0
don['t]	1
i	0
forget	0
i	0
think	1
it	1
was	0
a	1
three	1
fifty	1
seven	1
i'm	1
not	1
sure	0

do	0
you	0
belong	1
to	1
a	0
gun	1
club	1
or	0
you	0
uh	0

he	1
belonged	1
to	0
one	1
awhile	0
back	1
uh	1
since	0
we	0
mo[ved]	0
we've	1
only	1
been	1
here	1
in	0
texas	1
for	1
about	0
a	1
year	1

um-hum	0

uh	0
we	1
can't	1
even	0
find	1
a	1
place	0
to	1
shoot	1
just	1
for	1
target	1
practice	1

no	0
kidding	0

i'd	0
love	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
shotgun	1
we	1
traded	1
his	1
pistol	1
for	1
that	1
shotgun	1

huh	0
well	0
the	0
the	1
um	1
uh	1
clubs	1
that	1
we've	1
got	1
around	1
here	1
are	0
kind	1
of	0
expensive	1
but	0
uh	0
it's	0
well	1
worth	0
it	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
down	1
and	0
shoot	1
up	0
against	0
a	0
sand	1
bag	1
and	0
so[me]	0
targets	1
and	0
have	1
uh	0
competition	1
um	0
i've	1
never	1
really	0
joined	1
a	0
club	1
because	0
i	0
haven't	1
got	0
the	0
time	1
not	1
because	0
i	0
haven't	0
got	0
the	0
desire	1
uh	0
there's	0
an	1
annual	1
membership	1
fee	1
uh	1
that's	0
that's	1
fairly	1
high	1
plus	1
there's	0
initi[ation]	1
initiation	1
fee	0
that	1
you	1
have	1
to	0
pay	1
as	0
a	0
first	1
time	1
uh	0
uh	0
member	1

so	0
the	0
whole	1
process	1
can	0
cost	1
you	0
a	0
hundred	1
fifty	0
dollars	1
just	0
to	0
join	0
the	0
club	1
plus	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
ammunition	1
in	0
any	0
tournaments	1
that	0
you	0
would	1
join	1
in	0

yeah	0
well	0
that's	0
what	0
uh	0
my	0
husband	1
wh[en]	0
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	0
it	0
gun	1
club	0
when	0
they's	0
done	1
that	1
it	0
you	1
know	0
he	1
went	0
mostly	1
just	0
to	0
um	0
shoot	1
at	0
paper	1
targets	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
but	0
you	1
know	0
they	1
used	0
speed	1
and	0
accuracy	1
and	0
all	0
that	1

i	1
think	1
the	1
the	0
gun	1
clubs	1
serve	1
a	1
useful	1
purpose	1
in	0
fact	1
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
somehow	1
they	0
tie	1
the	0
legislation	1
into	0
not	0
only	0
when	0
you	0
buy	1
a	0
weapon	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
uh	0
show	1
that	0
you've	0
gone	0
to	0
school	1
or	0
gone	0
to	0
some	0
class	1
to	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
handle	1
that	0
weapon	0

that's	1
a	0
good	0
i've	1
never	0
thought	1
of	0
that	1

that's	1
a	0
good	1
point	1

and	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
it	0
even	1
a[fter]	0
after	1
you	0
wait	1
your	0
nine	0
days	1
if	0
you	0
don't	1
know	0
how	0
to	0
hand[le]	1
it's	0
just	1
like	0
putting	1
someone	0
in	0
an	0
automobile	1
that	0
doesn't	1
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
and	0
you	0
give	1
him	0
a	0
license	1
because	1
he	0
waited	1
nine	1
days	0

yeah	0
that	0
and	1
yeah	0

he	1
could	0
he	1
could	0
not	0
only	1
um	1
uh	0
shoot	1
himself	1
he	0
could	0
he	0
could	1
uh	0
mishandle	1
a	0
weapon	0
leave	1
it	0
at	0
home	1
and	1
let	0
a	0
child	1
get	0
at	1
it	0

and	0
well	1
we	1
uh	1
we	1
was	1
living	1
on	0
a	1
navy	1
base	1
down	0
in	0
memphis	1
and	0
uh	1
this	0
one	1
guy	0
decided	1
to	0
play	1
uh	0
lonesome	1
cowboy	1
or	0
something	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
twirling	1
his	0
gun	1
around	0
and	1
shot	1
himself	0
in	0
his	1
foot	1

wow	0
he	0
was	0
fortunate	0
he	0
[laughter-could]	1
[laughter-he]	0
[laughter-could]	0
[laughter-of]	0
[laughter-hit]	1
[laughter-something]	0
[laughter-else]	1

well	0
he	1
went	0
tumbling	1
down	0
the	0
steps	1
along	1
with	0
uh	0
shooting	1
his	0
foot	1
almost	0
off	1
he	0
broke	1
his	0
leg	1
and	0
a	0
collar	1
bone	1
and	0
couple	1
of	0
other	1
things	0
i'm	0
sure	1
being	0
mister	1
cowboy	1
i	0

wow	0

i	0
can't	1
remember	0
what	1
the	0
na[me]	0
term	1
was	0
going	1
around	0
it	0
was	0
about	0
four	1
to	0
five	1
years	0
ago	0

but	0
naw	1
th[e]	0
i	1
guess	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
good	1
idea	1

about_1	0
uh	0
private	1
citizens	1
selling	1
uh	0
weapons	1
like	0
if	0
you	0
wanted	1
to	0
sell	1
your	0
pistol	1
to	0
me	1
huh	0
how	0
do	0
you	1
feel	0
about	0
that	1
do	0
you	0
believe	1
there	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
legislation	1
guiding	1
the	0
um	0
buyer	1
and	0
the	0
seller	1
and	0
or	0
do	0
you	1
believe	1
that	0
you	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
sell	1
your	0
system	1
uh	0
because	0
you	0
own	1
it	0

uh	1
that's	1
a	0
hard	1
one	0
because_1	1
we	0
did	1
that	0
but	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
there	1
ought	0
to	0
be	0
some	1
rule	0
against	1
it	0
i'll	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
person	1
who	0
sells	1
the	0
gun	1
ought	1
to	0
protect	1
themself	1
because	1
if	0
that	1
gun's	1
registered	1
to	0
them	1
and	0
somebody	1
else	1
uses	0
that	0
gun	0
in	0
something	1
the	0
cops	1
are	0
gonna	1
come	0
to	1
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
is[n't]	0
isn't	1
there	0
a	0
way	1
to	1
um	0
to	0
deregister	1
yourself	0
after	0
you	0
register	1
a	0
gun	0

ah	0

i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	0
i've	1
only	0
had	1
one	1
gun	0
and	0

because	0
i	1
have	0

and	0
i've	0
kept	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
the	0
one	1
gun	0
that	0
was	0
in	0
my	1
name	1

yeah	0
is	0
it	1
registered	0

yeah	0
i	1

the	0
um	1
the	0
rifle	1
that	0
i've	1
got	0
is	0
not	1
registered	1

and	0
um	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
why	1
i	0
never	1
registered	0
it	0
but	0
the	0
uh	0

i	1
don't	0
think	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
register	1
a	0
shotgun	1

um	0
i'd	0
i'd	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
it's	0
voluntary	0
the	0
um	0
the	0

well	0
see	1
uh	0
my	1
husband	1
has	0
a	0
thing	1
if	0
they	1
go	1
to	0
uh	0
regulating	1
uh	0
all	1
right	0
uh	0
banning	1
guns	1
o[f]	0
pri[vate]	0
private	1
pri[vate]	1
private	1
ci[tizens]	0
citizens	1

yeah	0

this	0
my	1
kid	1
is	0
jumping	1
on	0
me	0
i	0
can't	1
hardly	0
talk	1

my	0
husband	1
feels	1
that	0
they'll	0
come	1
and	0
collect	1
everybody's	0
guns	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
that	0
could	0
happen	0
it's	0
just	0
like	1
the	0
uh	0
the	0
social	1
security	1
system	1
once	1
they	1
uh	1
they	0
gave	1
everybody	0
a	0
number	1
and	0
now	1
they're	1
making	1
you	1
um	0
uh	0
get	1
one	0
at	0
at	0
birth	1

and	0
once	1
they	0
have	1
your	0
number	1
they	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
your	1
identification	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
if	0
you	1
try	1
to	1
to	0
do	0
anything	1
um	0
like	1
uh	0
not	0
identify	1
yourself	0
to	0
the	0
government	1
they	1
know	0
who	0
you	0
are	1

and	0
everything	0
about	0
you	0

and	0
that's	0
true	0

uh	0
i	0
bu[t]	0
you	0
know	0
they	0
know	1
it	0
from	0
how	0
much	1
money	1
you	0
make	1
a	0
week	1
to	1
uh	0
probably	1
your	1
uh	0
my	0
kid	0
is	0
banging	0
i	0
was	0
seeing	1
what	0
they	0
was	0
banging	1
on	0
uh	0
i've	1
lost	0
my	0
train	1
of	0
thought	1
i'm	0
sorry	0

that's	0
all	0
right	0
yeah	0
you	0
were	0
talking	1
about	1
uh	0
um	0
fed[eral]	1
what	1
the	0
federal	1
government	1
knows	1
about	0
people	1

oh	0
the	0
social	0

yeah	0
they	0
pr[obably]	0
they	0
probably	1
know	0
everything	1
from	0
half	1
the	0
time	1
wh[at]	0
ho[w]	0
what	0
time	1
you	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
bathroom	1

they	0
probably	0
do	0

no	0
that's	0
that's	0
a	0
little	0
bits	0
extreme	0
but	0
they	1
could	0

tuesday	1

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
no	0
waiting	1
period	1
on	0
that	1

naw	0
[laughter-none]	0
whatsoever	0

you	0
ca[n]	0
call	0
w[e]	0
we	1
sold	0
a	0
refrigerator	1
through	1
it	0
and	1
it	0
took	1
us	0
all	1
of	0
twelve	1
hours	0

you	0
sell	0
the	0
refrigerator	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i'm	0
sure	1
it'd	0
be	0
even	1
less	0
for	0
somebody	1
with	0
a	0
good	1
gun	1

hm	0
yeah	0
i	0
think	1
the	0
federal	1
government	1
is	0
um	0
is	0
really	1
far	1
away	1
from	0
uh	0
um	0
control	1
i	1
i	0
don't	1
believe	1
in	0
um	0
should	0
i	0
shouldn't	1
probably	1
say	0
control	1
i	0
mean	0
regulation	0
control	1
is	0
something	0
that	0
i	0
wouldn't	1
want	0
the	0
federal	1
government	1
to	0
have	1
b[ut]	0
um	0
but	0
i	0
would	1
like	0
to	0
see	1
them	0
have	1
a	0
monitoring	1
capability	1
so	1
that	0
they	0
know	1
who	1
has	1
what	0
weapons	1

yeah	0
well	0
i'll	0
agree	1
with	0
you	0
there	1
they	0
do	1
have	0
too	1
much	0
control	1
over	0
us	0
already	1

yeah	0

uh	0
we	1
could	0
look	0
at	0
our	0
paychecks	1
and	0
see	1
how	0
much	0
control	1
they	0
have	1

unfortunately	1
we	1
uh	0
we	0
vote	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
people	1
who	0
spend	1
the	0
money	1
so	0
i	0
can't	1
complain	1
too	1
much	0

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
they're	0

you	1
want	1
to	1
start	1

well	1
i	1
guess	1
i	1
would	1
first	1
identify	1
myself	1
as	1
middle	1
aged	1
and	1
therefore	1
having	1
seen	1
the	0
last	1
generation	1
i	1
guess	1
it	1
puts	1
me	1
in	1
you	1
know	1
gives	1
me	1
a	1
perspective	1
on	0
that	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

um	1
i	1
am	1
quite	1
positive	1
on	0
the	1
things	1
that	0
i	0
have	0
seen	0
happen	1
recently	1
relative	1
to	0
women	1
in	1
both	1
in	0
society	1
and	0
in	0
the	1
work	1
place	1
uh	0
there's	1
no	1
doubt	0
about	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
f[irst]	1
was	1
first	1
graduated	1
from	1
college	1
the	1
impression	1
was	1
that	1
a	1
woman's	1
career	1
would	0
consist	1
of	1
a	0
childbearing	1
years	1
and	0
perhaps	1
a	0
return	1
to	0
the	1
office	1
but	1
not	1
necessarily	1
uh	1
now	1
i	0
think	0
the	1
change	1
that	1
i've	1
seen	0
as	1
much	1
as	0
anything	1
is	1
one	1
where	0
couples	1
uh	1
are	0
more	1
carefully	1
planning	1
their	1
intention	1
on	1
how	1
to	0
sh[are]	1
both	0
share	1
homemaking	1
duties	1
and	1
also	1
how	1
women	1
will	1
uh	0
have	1
their	0
children	1
and	1
then	0
deliberately	1
sort	1
of	1
plan	1
how	1
they	0
go	1
back	1
to	0
the	0
work	1
place	0

i	0

and	1
i	1
guess	1
that's	1
a	0
significant	1
change	1
that	1
of	0
i've	1
both	0
participated	1
in	0
an[d]	0
and	1
noticed	1

i	0
agree	1
um	1
the	0
equality	1
of	1
uh	1
the	1
roles	1
now	1
between	1
the	1
sexes	1
i	1
guess	1
has	1
been	1
dramatically	1
demonstrated	1
with	0
this	1
war	1
especially	1
compared	1
with	1
uh	1
the	1
vietnam	1
war	1
and	1
you	1
see	1
women	1
going	1
off	1
to	1
wars	1
as	0
well	1
as	1
men	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
i	1
have	1
wondered	1
why	1
they	1
allowed	1
or	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
both	1
the	1
father	1
and	0
mother	1
go	1
uh	1
and	1
the	0
children	1
are	0
left	1
without	0
either	1
parent	1
now	0
to	0
me	1
that's	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
drawback	1
but	1
uh	0
i	1
guess	1
it's	1
a	1
price	1
you	1
pay	1
and	1
i	0
also	1
wonder	1
about	0
the	1
children	1
that	0
are	0
being	1
brought	0
up	1
in	1
the	1
uh	0
uh	0
day	1
care	0
centers	1

wonder	1
about	1
them	0
in	0
what	0
way	1

well	1
uh	1
from	0
what	1
i	0
understand	1
there's	0
been	0
studies	1
that	1
uh	1
these	0
children	1
are	1
uh	1
more	1
rebellious	1
uh	1
they	1
term	1
it	1
as	1
more	1
uh	1
creative	1
but	1
uh	0
that	0
they	1
uh	0
are	1
much	1
more	1
contentious	1

uh-huh	1

so	1
i	1
i	1
don't	1
i	0
i	1
guess	1
we'll	1
have	1
to	0
see	1
another	1
generation	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
differences	1
a	1
child	1
being	0
brought	1
up	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
in	1
a	0
kind	1
of	0
a	1
uh	0
community	1
rather	1
than	1
a	0
home	1

uh-huh	1

i	1
have	1
not	1
to	0
be	1
honest	1
had	1
much	1
experience	1
with	0
children	1
in	0
that	0
situation	1
i	1

yeah	1

i	1
i	0
guess	1
one	0
knows	1
one's	1
own	0
story	1
and	0
i	0
know	1
uh	0
in	0
my	1
children's	0
case	1
it	0
was	1
one	1
where	1
uh	0
pretty	1
much	1
up	1
until	1
the	0
older	1
of	0
two	1
was	1
in	1
uh	0
let's	1
see	1
i	1
guess	1
basically	1
starting	1
junior	0
high	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
was	1
in	0
fifth	1
grade	0
when	1
my	0
wife	1
reentered	0
the	1
work	1
force	0

uh-huh	0

um	1

so	0
they	1

so	0
i	0
guess	1
my	0
experience	1
is	1
is	1
just	1
with	0
what	0
we	1
did	0
and	1
and	0
so	0
they	0
didn't	1
really	0
go	1
through	0
the	1
child	1
care	0
route	0
they	1

yeah	1

they	1
were	0
able	1
to	0
be	0
home	1
together	1
um	0
and	1
we	0
never	1
actually	0
experienced	1
that	1
what	1
in	0
terms	1
of	0
changes	1
relative	1
to	0
women	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
and	0
and	0
potential	1
changes	0
over	1
the	0
the	0
next	1
generation	1
or	1
so	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
anticipate	1
um	0
an	0
increasing	1
equality	1
uh	0
greater	1
presence	0
of	0
women	0
in	0
management	1
roles	0

um-hum	1
uh-huh	1

um	1
i	0
don't	1
know	1
whether	1
there	0
will	1
be	1
an	1
increased	1
amount	1
of	1
of	0
surrogacy	1
that	0
we	0
see	1
i	0
just	1
don't	1
know	1

what	1
do	0
you	0
mean	1

um	1
deliberate	1
childbirth	1
by	0
surrogate	1
mother	1

oh	1
yeah	1

sort	1
of	0
rent	1
a	1
mom	1
to	0
be	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
crass	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
uh	1
uh	0
whether	1
one	0
might	0
conceive	1
no	0
pun	0
intended	1
of	0
the	1
possibility	1
that	0
there	0
might	1
be	0
a	1
kind	1
of	0
a	1
deliberate	1
uh	0
um	0
a	0
professional	1
mother	1
a	0
person	1
for	1
instance	0
that	1

yeah	1

that's	0
strange	1

a	0
nanny	1
sort	1
of	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	1
could	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
could	0
envision	1
a	0
society	1
where	0
that	0
would	0
happen	1
and	0
make	0
an	0
interesting	1
uh	0
uh	0
story	1
or	0
whatever	1
i	0

yeah	1

i	0
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
have	0
a	0
philosophical	1
problem	1
with	0
that	0
in	0
fact	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
sort	0
of	0
raises	1
nurturing	1
and	0
being	0
a	0
mother	1
to	0
what	0
it	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
which	0
is	0
a	0
respected	1
profession	1

that's	0
right	1
that's	0
right	1

uh	0
um	0
i	0
i	0
don't	1
have	0
a	0
other	1
than	0
than	0
a	0
reading	1
and	0
and	0
male	1
perspective	1
on	0
on	0
the	0
var[ious]	1
on	0
the	0
biological	1
urges	1
involved	1
relative	0
to	0
being	0
a	0
mother	1
or	0
not	1
uh	0
i	0
know	1
that	0
that	0
my	1
sense	0
is	0
that	1
i	0
have	1
very	1
much	1
an	0
interest	1
and	0
had	1
one	0
in	0
being	0
a	0
parent	1
i	0
i	0
don't	1
know	1
that	0
i	1
uh	1
felt	1
myself	0
necessarily	1
encumbered	1
with	0
the	0
necessity	1
to	0
have	0
heirs	1

uh-huh	1

uh	1
i	1
don't	1
have	1
boys	1
that	0
doesn't	1
didn't	0
bother	1
me	1
never	0
has	1
vision	1
more	0
women	0
deliberately	1
raising	0
children	1
either	1
in	0
surrogacy	1
or	1
or	1
as	0
a	0
professional	0
nanny	1
nanny	1
as	0
you	1
put	0
it	0
uh	1

yeah	1

maybe	1
we'll	0
see	0
a	0
growth	1
in	0
that	1
where	0
someone	1
makes	1
uh	0
a	0
career	1
out	0
of	0
say	1
taking	1
care	0
of	0
five	1
or	0
six	1
children	1
as	0
opposed	0
to	0
day	0
care	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

it	0
would	0
be	1
a	0
sort	0
of	0
day	1
care	0
but	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
more	1
of	0
a	0
family	0
setting	1

right	1

um	0
i	1
know	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
young	1
people	0
characterized	1
i	0
guess	1
as	0
being	0
half	1
my	0
age	1
so	0
that	0
by	0
definition	1
that	0
means	0
they're	0
young	1
uh	0
that	1
in	0
my	1
work	0
place	1
who	1
are	0
both	1
of	0
them	0
earning	1
rather	0
decent	0
professional	1
salaries	0
who	0
probably	1
would	0
consider	0
paying	1
a	0
woman	1
uh	0
eight	1
or	0
nine	0
or	0
ten	1
thousand	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
to	0
take	1
care	0
of	0
their	0
child	1
i	0

um-hum	1
um-hum	0

to	0
come	1
in	0
and	0
live	1
with	0
them_1	1

i	0
could	0
easily	1
envision	1
that	0
pardon	1

to	0
come	1
in	0
and	0
live	1
with	0
them_1	0

or	0
to	0
put	1
their	0
child	1
into	0
a	0
s[etting]	0
into	0
a	0
home	1
setting	1
where	0
they	1
would	0
you	0
know	1
like	1
they	1
they	0
would	0
get	1
leave	1
at	0
eight	1
in	0
the	0
morning	1
and	1
and	0
drop	1
a	0
two	1
year	0
old	0
off	1
in	0
a	0
home	1
where	0
you	0
knew	1
there	0
were	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
four	1
other	0
kids	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
and	0
you	0
were	0
paying	1
for	0
really	1
high	1
quality	0
care	1

yeah	1

right	1

uh	0
i	0
have	1
acquaintances	1
of	0
mine	1
where	0
i	0
know	1
that	0
they	0
are	1
paying	0
figures	1
on	0
on	0
the	0
order	1
of	0
what	0
i	0
quoted	1
to	0
someone	1
because	0
that's	1
what	0
the	0
experience	1
they	0
want	1
and	0
i	1
would	1
imagine	1
if	0
there	0
are	0
more	1
of	0
people	1
like	0
that	1
with	0
an	0
opportunity	1
that	1
that's	0
a	0
possibility	1
of	0
a	0
change	1
that	0
we	0
could	0
see	1
in	0
the	0
next	0
few	0
years	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
then	0
you	0
might	1
have	0
more	1
control	1
over	0
uh	0
the	0
the	1
morals	1
that	1
they	0
would	0
be	1
taught	1
rather	0
than	1
in	0
like	0
a	0
classroom	1
or	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	1

um-hum	0
um-hum	0

i	0
know	0
the	0
day	1
care	0
centers	1
are	0
not	1
cheap	1
either	1
you	1
know	0
they're	1

i	0
haven't	0
ever	1
really	0
looked	1
at	0
them	0
are	0
you	1
aware	0
at	0
all	1
of	0
of	0
what	1
they	0
would	1
what	0
they	0
cost	1

uh	0
well	1
no	1
i	0

i	0
just	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
several	1
single	1
mothers	1
who	1
absolutely	1
can't	0
afford	1
it	0
they	1
have	0
to	0
go	0
with	1
the	0
a	0
single	1
uh	0
wh[at]	0
i	0
mean	1
a	0
babysitter	1
more	1
more	1
or	0
less	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
like	1
about	0
sixty	1
dollars	1
a	0
week	1
for	1
two	1
children	0
if	0
i'm	0
not	1
mistaken	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
pay	0
that	1
whether	1
you're	0
on	0
vacation	1
you	1
know	0
and	0
taking	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
children	1
or	0
if	0
the	0
children	1
are	0
at	0
home	1
at	0
home	1
sick	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
mean	1
that	1
is	0
you	1
know	0
just	1
a	0
a	0
rate	1
that	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
and	1
uh	0

what	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
envision	1
for	0
the	0
next	0
twenty	0
years	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
women	1
in	0
american	0
society	1

uh	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
really	0
don't	1
have	0
a	0
vision	1

that's	0
okay	1
too	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
i	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
they	0
will	1
be	0
more	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
because	1
uh	0
the	0
door's	1
open	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
it's	0
just	0
human	0
nature	1
to	0
walk	1
through	0
an	0
open	0
door	1
so	1
and	0
i	1
would	0
be	0
glad	1
to	0
see	0
that	1
i	0
hope	1
i	0
don't	0
see	1
a	0
lot	1
more	0
single	1
moms	1
but	1
i	0
it	0
seems	1
in	0
my	1
experience	1
i'm	1
running	0
across	0
single	1
women	0
all	1
the	0
time	1

i'm	1
i'm	0
noticing	1
that	0
too	1
and	0
and	0
i	0
notice	1
the	0
the	1
a	0
terming	1
emerging	0
called	0
solo	1
parents	1
that	0
i	1
am	0
very	1
aware	1
of	0
the	0
number	0
of	0
solo	1
mothers	1
that	1
that	0
i	0
encounter	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
that	1
that	1
is	0
a	0
little	0
troublesome	1
uh	0
because	0
the	0
pressures	1
on	0
them	0
are	1
are	0
rather	1
rather	1
formidable	1

yeah	1
yeah	1

it's	0
awful	1

yeah	1

uh	0
and	0
maybe	1
that's	0
a	0
change	1
we'll	0
see	1
maybe	1
uh	0
p[ossibility]	0
the	0
possibility	1
of	0
of	0
women	1
uh	0
who	0
deliberately	1
say	1
no	1
we'll	0
let	0
the	0
man	1
will	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
the	0
children	1
perhaps	1
in	0
the	0
event	1
of	0
a	0
separation	1
or	0
whatever	1

kind	1
of	0
a	0
it's	1
kind	1
of	0
to	0
establish	1
better	1
rapport	1
with	0
the	0
different	1
countries	1
and	1
um	1
it's	0
called	0
people	1
to	0
people	1
and	1
we'd	0
stay	1
in	0
people's	0
homes	1
and	0
then	1
we	0
got	0
to	0
also	1
tour	0
big	1
cities	0
and	0
i	1
really	0
enjoyed	1
it	0

was	0
that	1
in	0
high	1
school	0
or	0

uh-huh	0

or	0
was	0
that	0
a	0
college	1
thing	0

it	1
was	0
in	0
high	1
school	0
so	0
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
go	0
back	1
because_1	0
we	1
had	0
you	0
know	0
everything	1
was	0
rushed	1

i	1
bet	1

everything	1
we	0
had	0
like	0
an	0
hour	1
or	0
two	1
hours	1
at	0
the	0
louvre	1
you	0
know	1
things	0
like	0
that	1
where	1
you	0
need	1
the	1
whole	0
day	0
but	1
but	0
it	0
really	1

right	1

that's	1
where	0
a	0
a	0
camcorder	1
would	0
come	1
in	0
handy	1

exactly	1
that's	1
true	1

well	1
that	1
sounds	1
real	1
neat	1
so	1
y[ou]	0
you	0
haven't	1
been	0
back	0
to	0
europe	0
since	1
though	0
huh	0

no	1
i	1
always	1
thought	1
i	1
would	0
but	1
who	1
knows	1
now	1
i	1
got	0
married	1
and	0
maybe	1
some	1
day	0
maybe	1
that's	1
one	1
of	1
these	0
retirement	1
things	1

there	1
you	0
go	1
well	1
does	0
you	0
husband	1
uh	0
what	0
does	0
he	1
think	0
of	0
your	1
uh	0
t-shirt	1
an[d]	0
and	0

well	1
he	1
he	1
likes	0
it	0
all	0
right	0
he's	0
been	1
pretty	0
good	1
because_1	0
there's	0
t-shirt	1
stuff	1
all	0
over	1
the	0
[laughter-house]	1

does	0
he	0
help	1
out	1
much	1
or	0

okay	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
talk	1
describe	1
uh	1
job	1
benefits	1
and	1
so	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
uh	0
next	1
to	1
salary	1
do	1
you	1
rank	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
job	0
benefits	1

uh	1
i	1
would	1
say	1
the	1
medical	1
uh	1
group	1
insurance	1
uh	1
area	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
uh	1
covering	1
medical	0
costs	1
for	1
yourself	1
or	1
family	1
members	1

uh-huh	0

um-hum	1
well	0
um	1
does	1
your	0
company	1
have	1
good	0
benefits	1
in	1
that	1
in	1
that	0
regard	1

yeah	1
i	1
thin[k]	1
i	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
a	1
public	1
school	1
system	1
district	1
and	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	1
so	0
it's	1
different	1
than	1
a	1
company	1
where	0
most	1
companies	1
fund	1
almost	1
the	1
entire	0
thing	1
where	1
the	1
school	1
district	1
does	1
um	1
the	1
employee	1
must	1
pick	1
up	0
a	1
greater	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
uh	1
costs	1

oh	1
yeah	1

but	1
i[t]	1
overall	1
um	0
i've	0
been	1
pleased	1
with	1
it	1
over	1
the	0
years	1

um-hum	1

i	1
think	1
the	1
biggest	1
frustration	1
is	1
because	1
of	0
the	1
cost	1
of	1
insurance	1
going	0
up	1
every	1
year	1
our	1
district	1
has	1
had	1
to	0
alter	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
change	1
companies	1
or	0
now	1
we're	1
on	0
a	1
managed	1
care	1
thing	1
which	1
has	1
stressed	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	1
out	1
although	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
disturbed	1
me	1
any	1

hm	0

i	1
see	0

how	1
about_1	1
yourself	1

uh	0
well	1
i'm	1
my	1
medical	0
coverage	0
is	0
with	1
an	0
hmo	1

uh-huh	0

um	1
so	1
that's	1
in	0
my	1
opinion	0
that's	1
gett[ing]	0
that's	0
bordering	1
on	0
a	1
health	1
clinic	1
but	1
it	0
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
to	1
maintain	1
costs	1
and	0
still	1
provide	0
a	0
good	1
amount	0
of	0
coverage	1

right	1
yeah	1
our	1

um	0

our	1
district	1
did	0
that	1
for	0
the	1
ninety	1
one	1
and	0
the	1
ninety	1
school	1
year	1
or	0
calendar	1
years	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
the	0
hmo	1
and	1
um	0
i	0
i	1
was	1
because	1
my	1
my	0
same	1
doctor	1
you	1
know	1
agreed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
uh	0
they	1
usually	1
sign	1
a	0
contract	1
or	1
something	1

um-hum	0

and	1
um	1
uh	1
i	1
did	1
have	0
surgery	1
last	0
summer	1
and	1
i	1
paid	1
ten	0
dollars	1
when	1
i	1
went	0
to	1
see	1
him	0
that	1
first	1
day	1
and	0
i've	0
never	1
seen	1
another	0
bill	1
so	0
i	1
i	0
have	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
really	0
works	1
but	0

right	1

but	0
again	1
i	1
was	0
fortunate	1
because	1
my	1
doctor	0
agreed	1
to	1
be	0
in	1
it	1
uh	1
if	0
you've	1
been	0
going	1
to	0
a	1
doctor	1
for	0
you	1
know	1
ten	0
years	1
or	0
something	1
and	1
he	1
elects	0
not	1
to	0
join	1
it	0
can	1
be	0
very	1
stressful	1
for	0
you	0
know	1
those	0
people	1

yes	1

that's	0
right	1
yeah	0
i'm	0
i'm	0
fairly	0
young	1
myself	1
i've	0
only	1
been	0
when	0
i	0
first	1
started	0
working	1
which	0
three	1
years	0
ago	0
is	0
when	0
i	0
first	1
got	0
into	0
full	1
time	0
employment	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
at	0
that	1
time	0
i	0
immediately	1
joined	0
the	0
hmo	1
and	0
i	0
never	1
really	0
so	0
the	0
only	0
doctor	1
i	0
i've	0
kind	0
of	0
consistently	1
had	1
has	1
been	1
through	0
the	1
hmo	1
and	0
uh	1
you	0
know	1
for	0
me	1
it's	1
worked	1
out	0
real	1
good	1

yeah	1

right	1
but	0
if	0
you	1
you	1
know	0
have	0
a	0
family	1
and	0
and	0
um	0
everybody's	1
gone	1
to	0
different	1
doctors	1
uh	0
it	0
is	1
hard	0
to	0
give	0
up	1
somebody	0
who	0
you	1
feel	1
knows	1
you	0
and	0
your	0
body	1
and	0
your	0
just	1
has	0
you	1
know	0
all	1
the	0
medical	0
history	1
and	0
you	0
feel	0
comfortable	1
with	0
it	0
i	1

um-hum	1

i	1
i'm	0
sure	1
it	0
would	1
be	0
very	1
stressful	1
and	0
my	0
husband	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
just	0
elected	1
that	0
if	0
that	0
happens	1
i	1
will	0
go	0
and	0
just	0
pay	1
you	0
can	1
continue	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
your	0
own	1
doctor	1

hm	1

but	0
your	0
benefits	1
are	0
not	1
as	0
you	1
know	0
good	1
so	0
uh	0

um-hum	0
yeah	1
um	0
like	0
you	0
you	0
mentioned	1
you	0
work	0
for	0
a	0
school	1
system	0
i	1
work	0
for	0
uh	0
georgia	1
tech	1
in	0
the	0
research	1
branch	1

oh	0
all	1
right	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
another	1
one	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
i	1
rank	0
up	0
there	0
high	1
is	0
the	1
uh	0
kind	0
of	0
job	1
flexibility	0
and	0
time	1
off	1
um	0
i	1
enjoy	0
as	0
a	0
as	0
a	0
benefit	1

i	1
do	0
too	1
are	0
you	0
talking	1
about	0
like	0
spring	1
break	1
and	0

right	1
yeah	1

right	1

yeah	1
getting	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
breaks	1
between	0
quarters	1
and	0
that	1
and	0
having	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
vacation	1

right	1

it	0
it	0
really	1
um	0
i	1
don't	0
think	1
most	1
of	0
our	0
teachers	1
now	0
i'm	1
not	0
a	0
teacher	1
i	1
am	1
the	0
a	1
secretarial	1
executive	1
assistant	1
but	1
i	1
don't	0
think	0
the	0
teachers	1
could	0
stand	0
the	0
stress	1
[laughter-all]	0
all	1
year	0
long	1
frankly	1
it	1

um-hum	0

it	1
is	0
just	1
texas	1
has	0
really	1
um	0
you	1
know	1
they	1
want	1
everybody	1
educated	1
no	0
matter	0
what	1
it's	0
costs	1
uh	0
and	0
it	0
it	1
would	1
be	0
just	1
we	0
all	1
look	0
forward	1
to	0
like	1
in	0
two	0
weeks	1
we	0
have	0
spring	1
break	1
and	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
who	0
looks	0
forward	1
to	0
it	0
more	1
the	0
students	1
or	0
the	0
or	0
the	0
teachers	1
and	0
the	0
[laughter-staff]	1

um-hum	0

right	1

what	1
do	0
you	0
do	1
there	0

well	1
um	0
i'm	1
not	1
actually	1
on	0
the	1
teaching	1
faculty	0
but	1
we	1
have	1
a	0
large	1
research	1
organization	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
that's	1
who	1
i	0
work	1
with	0

okay	1

um	0
and	0
we're	0
given	1
you	1
know	0
a	0
good	1
bit	0
of	0
flexibility	1
in	0
what	0
we	0
do	1
we	0
can	0
kind	0
of	0
pursue	1
our	0
own	0
interests	1
in	0
terms	1
of	0
the	0
research	1
areas	0
that	0
we	1
study	1

well	1
that's	1
good	1
yeah	1
i	1
would	0
think	1
that	0
that	1
type	1
of	0
employment	1
you're	0
you're	0
one	1
day	0
you	0
might	0
be	0
really	1
tuned	0
in	0
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
oh	0
a	0
little	0
lukewarm	1
or	0
something	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
it's	1
good	1
that	0
they	0
allow	1
you	0
that	1

right	1

it	0
um	0
a[s]	0
i	0
say	1
the	0
schools	1
now	0
we	1
do	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
day	1
but	0
we	0
do	1
get	0
many	1
days	0
off	1
and	0
um	0
we	0
all	0
look	0
forward	1
to	0
it	0
that's	1

um-hum	0

that's	1
only	0
reason	0
i	0
work	1
there	0
is	0
that	0
my	0
children	1
now	0
have	0
graduated	1
and	1
graduated	0
from	0
college	1
but	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
i	0
worked	1
there	0
because	1
my	1
hours	1
and	0
days	1
were	0
the	0
same	1
as	0
theirs	1

oh	0
yeah	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	1
i've	1
just	0
continued	1
to	1
uh	0
stay	1
there	0
so	0

are	1
there	1
are	0
there	1
any	1
things	0
that	0
that	0
you'd	1
like	1
to	1
see	0
changed	1
in	0
terms	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
benef[its]	1

okay	1

so	1
are	1
you	1
a	1
freshwater	1
or	1

mostly	1
freshwater	1
uh	1

freshwater	1

yeah	1
i	1
i	1
used	0
to	0
fish	1
uh	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
real	1
young	1
down	0
in	1
galveston	1
with	1
my	1
parents	1
and	1
i	1
never	0
really	1
got	0
into	1
that	1
too	1
much	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
the	0
boat	1
really	1
to	1
to	0
do	1
anything	1
and	1
i	1
didn't	1
know	0
anybody	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
boat	1
now	1
so	1
i	1
don't	1
fish	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
saltwater	1

um-hum	1
most	1
of	0
my	0
fishing	1
has	0
been	1
in	0
the	0
saltwater	1
huh	1
mostly	1
deep	1
sea	1
fishing	1
for	1
grouper	1
and	0
bottom	1
fish	1

oh	1
really	1

oh	1
neat	1

and	1
uh	0
huh	0
i	1
have	0
caught	1
one	0
or	0
two	1
small	1
sharks	1

oh	1
really	1

and	1
uh	0
yes	1

what'd	0
you	0
do	1
with	1
them	1

put	1
them	0
[laughter-back]	1

you	1
didn't	1
get	1
a	1
big	0
kick	1
out	1
of	1
killing	1
them	0
like	1
some	1
people	1
do	1

no	1
no	0
no	1
i	1
love	1
shark	1
steak	1
but	1
uh	0
the	0
ones	1
i	0
caught	1
were	0
never	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
uh	0
really	1
do	1
anything	1
uh	1

do	0
they	1
have	1
a	1
limit	1
on	1
sharks	1
i	1
mean	0
is	0
that	1
like	0
a	1
a	1
sport	0
fish	1
can	0
you	1
actually	1
catch	1
those	1
and	1
there's	1
no	0
limit	1

is	0
there	1
a	0
limit	1
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1
i	0
know	1
i	1
my	0
home	1
is	0
in	0
uh	1
pensacola	1
florida	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
it's	0
they	0
do	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
shark	0
fishing	1
in	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
the	0
gulf	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
a	1
certain	1
period	0
of	1
time	1
during	0
the	0
year	1
they	0
have	1
all	0
along	1
the	1
gulf	0
coast	1
from	1
i	0
guess	1
from	0
galveston	1
to	1
mayport	1
they	0
have	1
uh	0
shark	1
tournaments	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
there's	0
part	1
either	1
as	0
part	1
of	1
or	0

i	1
was	0
able	0
to	0
do	1
uh	0
when	0
i	1
could	0
go	0
in	1
and	0
go	0
down	1
and	1
actually	1
pick	1
them	0
off	0
the	1
[laughter-bottom]	1

right	1

hand	1
picked	1

[laughter-that's]	1
[laughter-right]	1

the	0
weirdest	1
fishing	1
experience	1
i	0
ever	1
had	1
and	0
uh	0
people	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
are	0
still	1
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
if	0
i	0
really	1
caught	1
what	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
caught	1
we	1
were	0
in	1
uh	0
rockport	1
which	0
is	0
close	1
to	0
corpus	1

um-hum	0

and	0
we	0
had	0
been	1
fishing	1
in	0
a	0
canal	1
they	0
had	0
all	1
these	0
canals	1
up	0
through	0
this	1
one	0
little	0
retirement	1
area	0
and	1
uh	0
we'd	1
been	0
fishing	1
in	0
the	0
canals	1
and	0
all	1
we	0
were	0
catching	0
were	0
catfish	1
and	0
we	0
were	0
pretty	0
bored	1
with	0
that	1
so	0
we	0
thought	1
well	0
maybe	1
there	0
are	0
some	0
crab	1
in	0
here	1
we'll	0
try	1
to	0
catch	0
some	0
crab	1
so	0
i	1
got	0
my	0
chicken	1
neck	1
and	0
all	0
my	0
little	1
net	1
and	0
everything	1
and	0
something	1
i	0
had	0
a	1
rock	1
to	0
weight	1
it	0
down	1
something	0
grabs	1
and	0
just	0
runs	1
with	0
it	0
and	0
of	0
course	1
there's	0
no	0
hook	1
so	1
it	0
can't	1
be	0
a	0
fish	1

um-hum	0

i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
it's	0
not	0
a	0
fish	1
right	1
and	1
crab	1
they	0
don't	1
bite	1
like	0
that	1
they	1
don't	0
just	0
run	1
with	0
your	0
food	1
so	1
i	0
netted	1
it	0
and	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
ugliest	1
fish	0
i've	0
ever	1
seen	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
it	0
had	0
real	1
teeth	1
like	0
human	1
teeth	1
and	0
it	1
looked	1
archaic	1
i	1
i	0
had	0
no	1
idea	0
what	0
it	0
was	1
i	0
called	1
my	0
father	1
long	1
distance	1
just	0
to	0
describe	1
the	0
thing	1
and	0
it	0
had	1
the	0
rock	1
in	0
it's	1
mouth	1
it	1
not	1
the	0
chicken	1
but	0
the	0
rock	1
itself	1
is	0
what	1
it	0
had	0
grabbed	1

hm	1

they	0
say	1
it's	0
a	0
dogfish	1
from	0
everything	1
i've	0
described	1
it	0
was	0
brown	1
with	0
these	0
little	0
white	1
dots	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
it	0
made	0
a	0
loud	1
kind	0
of	0
almost	1
a	0
croaking	1
noise	0
like	0
a	0
croaker	1
does	1

uh-huh	0

it	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
strangest	1
thing	1
it	1
oh	1
i'll	0
never	1
get	0
over	1
that	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	0
get	0
in	0
the	0
water	1
anywhere	1
around	0
salt	1
water	0
because	0
i'm	0
sure	1
one	0
of	0
those	0
fish	1
are	0
there	1

well	0
we	1
used	0
to	1
i	1
guess	0
the	0
weirdest	1
thing	0
i've	1
ever	0
caught	1
is	1
uh	0
in	1
some	1
of	0
the	1
inlets	1
and	0
the	0
rivers	1
around	1
rehoboth	1
delaware	1

um-hum	0

they	1
have	0
a	0
fish	1
that's	0
called	1
an	0
oyster	1
cracker	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
you've	0
ever	0
heard	1
of	0
it	0

i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0
that	0
one	1

and	1
it	0
has	1
a	0
huge	1
strong	1
mouth	1
and	0
they	0
actually	1
uh	0
use	1
their	0
teeth	1
to	0
open	1
oysters	1

that's	0
where	1
it	0
gets	0
its	0
name	1
obviously	1
huh	1

um-hum	0
and	0
this	1
is	0
the	0
ugliest	1
fish	1
i	0
have	1
ever	1
seen	0
and	1

and	1
i	0
me[an]	0
and	0
they	1
come	1
in	0
all	0
si[ze]	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
i've	1
caught	0
them	1
from	1
you	1
know	0
three	1
or	0
four	0
inches	1
long	1
up	1
to	0
uh	0

um-hum	0

i	1
guess	0
the	1
la[rgest]	0
largest	1
one	0
i	0
ever	0
caught	1
was	0
probably	0
eight	1
or	0
ten	1
inches	0
long	0
but	0
just	1
huge	1
ugly	1
things	1
just	0
terrible	1

huh	1

can	0
you	0
eat	1
them	0

no	1
no	1

ooh	1
i	1
i	0
don't	1
think	0
i'd	0
want	1
to	0
even	1
if	0
you	0
could	1
if	0
they're	0
that	0
ugly	1
but	1

they	1
just	0
they	0
just	1
look	1
as	0
though	0
you	0
do	0
not	1
want	0
to	0
do	0
anything	0
with	1
them	0

that's	0
like	1
this	0
dogfish	1
it	0
was	1
it	1
scared	0
me	0
to	1
death	1

um-hum	0

it	0
was	0
u[gly]	1
it	0
really	1
it	0
didn't	1
look	0
like	1
it	0
looked	1
like	0
it	0
was	0
something	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
dark	1
ages	0
that	0
just	0
never	0
died	1

well	0
the	0
first	1
time	0
i	0
went	1
uh	0
surf	1
fishing	0
was	0
in	1
and	0
i	0
threw	1
my	0
line	0
out	1
and	1
the	0
first	1
thing	0
i	0
caught	1
was	0
a	0
sand	1
shark	0
which	0
was	0
probably	1
a	0
foot	1
and	0
a	0
half	1
or	1
uh	0
two	1
feet	0
long	1

and	0
scared	1
me	0
to	0
death	1

oh	0

i	0
i	1
had	0
never	1
seen	1
anything	0
and	0
then	1
i	1
was	0
fi[shed]	1
fished	1
for	0
another	0
half	1
hour	0
or	0
forty	0
five	0
minutes	0
caught	1
a	0
few	0
white	1
fish	1
and	0
so	1
forth	0
and	0
then	0
i	1
felt	0
something	1
relatively	0
heavy	1
and	0
i	1
thought	0
oh	1
really	1
here	1
i'm	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
get	1
one	0

and	1
i	0
pulled	1

okay	1
well	1
like	1
i	1
was	1
saying	1
burlington's	1
crime	1
it	1
doesn't	1
involve	1
children	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
see	1
on	0
the	1
tv's	1
from	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
washington	1
and	1
new	1
york	1
so	0
what	0
i	1
believe	1
the	0
people	1
want	1
the	1
subject	1
is	1
is	1
big	1
city	1
crime	1
which	1
is	1
something	1
that	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
any	0
first	1
hand	0
experiences	1
about	1
but	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
concerns	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
ideas	1
of	1
um	0
how	1
to	0
combat	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	1
think	1
uh	0
ideally	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
need	0
money	1
to	0
do	1
everything	1
so	0
that's	0
one	1
thing	1
that	1

um-hum	1

that	1
that's	1
one	1
thing	1
that	0
that's	1
that's	1
crime	1
that	0
you	1
can't	1
fight	1
it	0
if	1
you	1
need	1
that	1
money	1
so	1

right	0
yeah	0
well	0
when	1
uh	1
we	0
lived	1
in	1
san	1
antonio	1
i	1
grew	1
up	1
around	1
san	1
antonio	1
and	1
it's	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
uh	1
city	1
and	1
increasingly	1
growing	1
it's	1
has	1
kind	1
of	1
the	0
split	1
population	1
um	1
there's	1
a	1
lot	0
of	1
retired	1
military	1
uh	1
individuals	1
that	1
live	1
there	1
and	0
then	1
there's	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
hispanic	1
population	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
thing	0
that	1
we	1
noticed	1
that	1
over	1
the	1
years	1
has	1
gotten	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
is	1
hispanic	1
uh	1
gang	1
crime	1
in	1
the	0
city	1

oh	1

and	0
that	1
is	0
uh	0
been	1
the	0
worse	1
thing	1
that	0
we've	0
seen	0
happening	1
uh	1

does	1
it	1
spread	1
out	1
of	1
the	0
neighborhoods	1
into	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
uh	0
retired	1
people's	1
community	0
or	0
does	1
it	0
stay	1
in	0
the	0
bad	1
neighborhood	1

um	1
the	0
majority	1
of	1
the	0
actual	1
gang	1
crimes	1
like	1
the	1
the	0
drive	1
by	1
shootings	1
and	1
stuff	1
stays	1
in	0
the	0
neighborhoods	1
but	0
the	1
crime	1
spreads	1
out	0
into	1
the	1
more	1
affluent	1
uh	0
divisions	1
through	1
robberies	1
rape	1
and	1
uh	1
car	1
crime	0
there's	0
a	1
very	1
large	1
uh	0
or	1
very	1
high	1
percentage	0
of	0
car	1
theft	1
and	1
san	1
an[tonio]	1
san	1
antonio's	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	0
border	1
to	1
mexico	1
so	1
a	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	1
uh	1
cars	1
go	0
to	0
uh	0
you	1
know	1
hack	1
shops	1
and	0
they	1
take	1
them_1	1
apart	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
them_1	1
go	1
over	0
the	0
border	1
especially	1
like	1
mercedes	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
those	0
those	1
in	0
the	0
the	0

z	1
cars	0
the	0
datsun	1
cars	1
end	1
up	0
over	0
the	0

concern	1
if	1

really	1
lock	1

while	0
they're	0
in	1
the	0

until	1

done	1
especially	1
like	0
needlepoint	1

uh-huh	1

needlepoint	0
cushions	1
and	0
things	1

yeah	0

but	1
it	0
just	0
seems	1
like	0
there'd	0
be	0
so	1
much	0
time	1
involved	0
in	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
and	0
that	0
the	0
petty	1
point	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
it's	0

yeah	0

it's	0
like	0
god	1
it	0
j[ust]	0
just	0
seems	1
like	0
it's	0
easier	1
just	0
to	1
go	1
out	1
and	0
buy	1
it	1
[laughter-already]	0
[laughter-made]	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	1
wh[at]	0
what	1
is	0
it's	1
like	1
there	1
but	0
here	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
country	1
stuff	0
is	0
in	1
you	0
know	1
lot	1
of	0
the	0
woodwork	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
uh	0
stenciling	1

yeah	0

and	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
can	0
go	0
to	0
any	0
like	1
a	0
flea	0
market	0
and	0
stuff	0
and	0
there's	1
just	0
tons	1
of	0
stuff	0
everywhere	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
people	0
just	0
do	0
it	0
in	0
their	0
garage	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
then	0
on	0
weekends	0
they	0
go	0
out	1
and	1
sell	1
it	1
and	0
during	1
the	1
week	1
they	0
go	0
back	1
and	1
do	1
some	0
more	1

and	1
see	1
they	1
do	1
that	1
as	0
their	1
job	1
whereas	1
you	0
know	1
for	0
us	1
i[t]	0
and	0

right	1

and	0
they	1
make	1
it	1
cheaper	1
for	0
us	0
to	0
[laughter-buy]	1

yeah	1
definitely	0

so	0
but	1
and	0
i	0
i	1
mean	0
i'm	1
sure	0
it	0
must	1
be	0
relaxing	1
to	0
do	0
things	1
like	0
that	0
because	1
i	1
can	0
remember	1
when	0
i	0
used	0
to	0
do	1
you	0
know	0
those	0
little	1
salt	1
dough	0
figurines	1
and	1
things	0
it	0
was	0
it	1
was	0
relaxing	1
you	0
know	0
creative	1
you	1
felt	1
very	1
creative	1

um-hum	0

but	1
it	1
just	0
was	0
so	0
time	1
time	1
involved	1
you	0
know	1
so	0
much	0
time	1
involved	1
and	1
the	0
different	1
steps	1
and	0
things	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

so	1
and	0

okay_1	1
well	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	0
we're	0
okay	1
i	0
think	1
we	0
did	0
done	0
five	1
minutes	0
so	0
we	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
keep	0
talking	1
about	0
[laughter-nothing]	1
[laughter-anymore]	0

yeah	0
[laughter-so]	0

okay	1
well	0
thank	1
you	1

okay	1
i	0
hope	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
good	0
rest	1
of	0
your	0
weekend	0

thanks	1
bye-bye	0

[laughter-okay]	1
bye-bye	1

hello	1
ann	1

hello	1
chuck	1

um	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
i	1
attended	1
a	1
conference	1
here	1
at	1
utah	1
state	1
university	1
on	1
recycling	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
interested	1
to	0
hear	1
because_1	1
they	1
had	1
some	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
epa	1
and	1
lots	1
of	0
different	1
places	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	1
they	1
had	0
basically	1
decided	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	0
a	0
real	1
problem	1
here	1
within	1
a	1
few	0
years	1
on	0
solid	1
waste	1

um	0
i	0
didn't	1
think	1
that	1
was	0
a	1
new	1
revelation	1

well	1
it's	0
not	1
too	0
new	0

right	1
so	1
what	1
what	1
i[s]	0
is	1
the	1
epa	1
recommending	1
now	1

oh	0
they	1
really	1
didn't	0
propose	1
any	0
solutions	1
actually	1
they	0
were	0
the	1
guy	1
was	1
pretty	1
negative	1
about	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
was	1
doing	0
even	1
though	0
he	1
was	0
from	0
the	1
epa	1

um-hum	1

but	0
he	1
had	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	1
facts	1
to	1
to	1
give	1
and	1
things	0
like	0
how	1
many	0
solid	1
waste	0
plants	1
were	0
being	0
shut	1
down	1
and	0
and	1
uh	0
uh	0
one	0
of	1
the	0
most	1
interesting	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
was	1
recycling	1
of	1
of	1
news	1
print	0
and	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
um	1
the	0
city	1
of	0
new	1
york	1
and	0
how	1
they	0
went	1
and	1
collected	1
all	1
this	1
news	1
print	0

yeah	0

and	1
they	1
could	1
sell	1
it	1
for	1
a	0
while	1
they	0
were	1
able	1
to	1
sell	0
it	0
for	0
some	1
amount	0
per	0
ton	1
and	1
now	1
at	0
this	1
stage	0
of	0
the	1
game	0
where	1
they	1
have	1
gotten	1
into	0
recycling	1
they've	0
collected	1
so	1
much	1
news	1
print	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
to	1
have	0
it	1
hauled	0
away	1

why	1
that's	1
a	0
that's	0
a	0
common	1
problem	0
now	1
that	0
seems	1
that	1
has	0
happened	1
in	0
dallas	1
as	0
well	1
as	0
new	1
york	1
and	1
i	0
try	1
to	0
recycle	1
all	1
of	0
the	0
newspapers	0
that	0
come	0
to	0
my	1
house	0
and	0
after	1
a	0
while	1
i	1
just	1
quit	0
taking	0
the	0
newspaper	1
because	0
i	0
couldn't	1
recycle	1
it	0
anymore	0
which	1
isn't	1
good	1
for	0
business	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
either	0
i	0
suppose	1

yeah	0
we're	1
doing	0
some	0
here	1
in	0
in	1
cash	1
valley	1
the	1
community	1
here	1

um-hum	1

there's	1
uh	1
we've	1
actually	1
got	1
a	0
kind	1
of	1
a	0
nice	1
set	0
up	0
we've	1
got	1
a	0
couple	0
of	1
plants	1
here	1
that	1
actually	1
take	0
uh	1
recycled	0
paper	1
and	1
shred	1
it	0
and	1
spray	1
it	0
with	0
chemical	0
treatment	1
so	0
that	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
fire	1
hazard	0
and	0
make	0
it	0
into	0
insulation	1

right	1

and	0
they	1
can	1
actually	0
use	1
as	1
much	1
recycled	1
paper	0
as	1
the	1
community	1
can	1
get	1
to	1
them_1	0
because	1
they're	0
actually	1
buying	1
it	1
and	0
shipping	1
it	0
in	0
from	0
outside	1

well	0
that's	1
good	1

so	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
real	0
keys	1
it	0
sounds	1
like	0
to	0
getting	0
recycling	1
for	0
uh	0
paper	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1
to	0
go	1
is	0
to	0
get	1
some	0
sort	1
of	1
business	1
to	1
actually	0
want	1
it	0
once	1
you've	0
collected	1
it	1

right	1
there	0
has	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
a	0
reuse	1
for	0
it	0
i	1
mean	0
that's	0
why	1
they	1
recycle	1
the	0
one	0
i	1
think	0
is	0
the	0
most	1
interesting	1
is	0
with	0
the	0
recycled	1
bottles	1
and	0
all	1
that	0
uh	0
the	0
industry	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
doing	1
with	0
the	0
recycled	1
polymers	1
uh	0
everything	1
from	0
uh	0
waste	1
baskets	1
to	0
carpet	1
to	0
the	1
no	1
stick	0
i	0
mean	0
the	0
sticky	1
slide	1
rugs	0
under	1
the	0
carpet	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
i	1
think	0
they're	0
even	0
putting	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
roadways	1
these	1
days	1
and	0
they're	1
making	0
clothes	1
now	0
that	1
are	1
recycled	1
like	1
the	0
recycled	1
plastic	0
coke	1
bottles	0
and	0
and	0
milk	1
cartons	0
and	0
things	0
like	1
that	1

and	1
there's	1
a	0
paper	0
presented	1
at	0
this	0
conference	1
from	0
a	0
guy	1
from	1
alabama	1
and	0
he	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
hired	1
to	0
do	0
a	0
study	1
by	0
two	1
departments	1
for	0
the	0
government	1
one	1
was	0
like	0
environmental	1
protection	1
and	0
the	1
other	0
one	0
was	0
oh	0
i	1
can't	0
remember	0
what	0
but	0
the	0
basic	1
idea	1
it	0
was	0
presented	1
to	0
him	1
was	0
how	1
can	0
we	0
maximize	1
the	0
amount	0
of	0
energy	1
that	0
we	0
can	0
get	1
back	1
from	0
recycling	1
and	1
minimize	1
the	0
volume	1
of	1
stuff	1
we	0
are	0
putting	1
into	1
our	1
landfill	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
the	1
solution	1
that	0
he	1
came	0
up	0
with	0
for	0
plastics	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
really	1
quite	0
amazing	1
because_1	0
he	0
says	0
well	1
the	0
best	1
thing	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
plastics	1
is	0
to	0
burn	1
them_1	0

oh	1
really	1

he	0
came	1
to	1
the	0
conclusion	1
plastics	1
is	1
actually	1
one	1
of	0
the	1
biggest	1
problems	1
in	1
landfills	1
cause	1
it's	1
it's	0
low	1
weight	1
but	1
it's	0
high	1
volume	1
so	0
it	0
takes	1
up	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
space	1

right	1

and	1
there's	0
almost	1
no	1
energy	1
there's	0
very	1
little	0
energy	1
value	0
in	0
actually	1
doing	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
recycling	1
but	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
energy	0
in	0
it	0
if	0
you	1
can	0
burn	1
it	0
and	0
use	0
it	0
to	0
produce	1
electricity	1

huh	0

so	1
his	1
solution	1
was	0
to	0
burn	1
plastic	1
collect	1
it	0
and	0
burn	1
it	0

well	1
it's	0
carbon	1
so	0
that	1
makes	0
sense	1
like	0
a	1
carbon	1
fuel	1
of	1
some	1
sort	0
but	0
what	1
what	0
about	1
emissions	1

yeah	1

and	0
it's	0
more	1
than	0
even	0
paper	1
or	0
something	1
like	0
that	0
there's	0
more	1
energy	0
in	0
it	0
per	0
pound	1
or	0
whatever	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
he	0
didn't	1
deal	1
with	0
that	1

oh	1

he	0
just	1
said	0
burn	1
it	0

[laughter-okay]	1

he	0
didn't	0
talk	1
about	0
cleaning	1
it	0
up	1
or	0
anything	0
like	0
that	1
so	0
it's	0
not	1
very	0
practical	1
is	0
it	0

no	1
well	1
that's	1
interesting	1
i	0
bet	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
good	1
day	1
at	0
the	1
uh	0
conference	1
then	1

yeah	1
well	0
real	1
interest[ing]	0

did	0
it	1
change	1
anything	0
for	0
you	1

um	0
not	1
too	0
much	1
i'm	1
uh	0
i	1
got	0
a	0
bit	1
actuall[y]	0

where	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
most	1
of	1
your	1
news	1

i	1
watch	1
the	1
macneil	1
lehrer	1
news	1
hour	1
and	1
i	1

of	1
sources	1

paper	1
everyday	1

and	1

work	0

and	1
then	1
you	1
know	1
usually	1
over	0
lunch	1
there'll	1
be	0
a	0
big	1
topic	1
of	0
conversation	1
on	1
something	1
from	1
the	0
news	1

um-hum	1
i	1
normally	1
find	1
that	1
uh	0
i	1
i'm	1
probably	1
the	1
most	1
um	1
news	1
hungry	1
of	1
my	0
friends	1
so	1
i	1
don't	1
we	0
don't	0
normally	0
talk	1
about	0
the	0
news	1
at	0
lunch	0

i	1
i	1
find	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
to	0
only	1
subscribe	0
to	1
the	0
paper	1
on	1
the	0
weekend	1
simply	1
because	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
during	1
the	0
week	1

but	0

but	0
um	1
i	1
would	1
always	1
end	1
up	1
arriving	1
at	0
work	1
late	1
because	0
i	1
would	1
always	0
end	0
up	1
skimming	1
the	1
headlines	1
spending	0
too	1
much	0
time	1
reading	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1

yeah	1

so	1
i	0
have	1
to	1
cut	1
myself	0
down	1
to	0
the	1
weekend	1
plus	1
after	1

um	0
one	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
that	1

we've	1
had	1
some	1
very	1
interesting	0
conversations	1
over	0
lunch	1

i	1
will	1
admit	0
i	1
work	1
with	1
uh	0
someone	1
who's	0
iranian	1

and	1
he	1
definitely	0
has	0
a	1
very	1
different	1
slant	1
on	1
the	1
news	0
he's	1

he's	1
very	1
very	1
skeptical	1
of	0
the	0
news	1
media	0
and	1
i	1
will	1
admit	1
i'm	1
reasonably	1
skeptical	1
also	1
but	0
he's	1
i	1
don't	1
know	0
uh	1
he's	1
mu[ch]	0
much	1
much	1
more	1
so	0
it's	1
it's	0
sort	1
of	0
interesting	1
though	0
because	1
he	0
does	1
bring	0
a	0
a	1
much	1
um	0
different	1
perspective	0
with	0
all	1
the	0
gulf	1
goings	1
on	1
um	0
he	0
was	1
always	0
speaking	1
in	1
terms	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
american	0
imperialism	1
reasserting	1
itself	0
and	0

and	0
i	0
suppose	1
it's	0
a	0
different	1
attitude	1
that	0
we	0
normally	0
don't	1
hear	1
in	0
the	0
country	1

um-hum	0

well	0
i	1
i	1
uh	1
i	1
like	0
the	1
print	1
news	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
the	0
television	1
news	1
because	0
television	1
news	0
tends	1
to	1
sensationalize	1

um-hum	0
true	1
um	0

the	0

i	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
macneil	1
lehrer	1
probably	1
doesn't	1

they	1
um	0
tend	1
to	0
spend	1
quite	1
a	0
bit	1
of	0
time	1
on	0
one	0
story	1

they	1
will	0
have	1
maybe	0
two	1
or	1
three	1
main	0
stories	1
and	0
just	1
spend	0
a	0
very	1
large	1
amount	0
of	0
time	0

sort	1
of	0
like	0
the	0
uh	0
what	1
is	0
that	0
abc's	1
nightline	1

uh	0
well	0
i	1
guess	0
they	0
only	1
normally	0
stick	1
with	0
just	1
the	0
one	1
um	0
story	1

but	0
they	1
they	1
can	0
do	0
a	1
much	0
better	1
job	1
since	0
they	1
don't	1
have	0
to	1
chop	1
it	1
into	0
little	1
two	1
minute	0
stories	1

they	1
don't	0
report	1
on	0
every	0
murder	1
and	0
shooting	1
that	0
happened	1
in	0
in	0
every	1
little	0
town	1

no	1
no	1
it's	0

it's	0
very	1
much	0
national	1
interest	1
news	0

yeah	1

a	0
lot	1
of	1
times	0
they	0
end	0
up	0
um	1
with	0
these	0
panels	1
of	0
experts	1
and	0
they	0
go	0
back	0
and	0
forth	1
where	0
everyone's	0
giving	1
some	0
opinions	1
and	0
sometimes	0
that	1

i	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
the	0
value	1
of	0
that	1
because	1
um	0
i	1
saw	0
plenty	1
of	1
jokes	1
and	0
and	0
um	1
oh	0
editorial	1
cartoons	1
about	0
all	0
the	1
retired	1
generals	1
making	0
their	0
living	1
[laughter-during]	1
the	0
the	1
gulf	0
war	1

i've	1
been	0
getting	0
a	0
kick	1
out	1
of	1
those	0
lately	1

although	1
um	1
i'm	0
i'm	1
only	0
twenty	1
five	0
so	0

so	0
i've	1
never	0
actually	1
been	0
through	0
a	0
period	0
of	1
war	1

and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
anyone	1
in	0
the	0
military	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
have	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
background	1
knowledge	0
in	0
uh	0
military	0
strategy	1
and	0
and	0
weaponry	1
and	0
and	0
all	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	0
and	0
i	1
thought	1
the	0
generals	0
were	0
very	0
interesting	1
now	0

now	0
when	0
they	0
started	1
to	0
speculate	1
i	0
i	1
saw	1
that	0
for	1
what	0
it	0
was	1
and	0
thought	0
all	1
of	1
these	0
guys	1
don't	0
know	1
what's	0
going	0
on	1
but	0

but	0
i	0
thought	1
they	0
were	0
the[y]	0
they	1
were	0
interesting	0
and	0

and	0
and	0
they	0
shed	1
some	0
light	1
on	0
what	0
was	0
going	0
on	1
for	0
me	1

i	0
will	1
admit	0
it's	0
interesting	0
i	1
i	1
i'm	1
twenty	0
six	0
so	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
any	0
more	0
experience	1
in	0
that	0
than	0
you	1
um	0
it	0
it	0
it	1
was	1
very	0
interesting	1
that	0
it	0
seemed	1
like	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
commentators	1
had	0
their	0
axe	1
to	0
grind	0
you	0
know	0
there	0
were	0
some	1
that	0
were	0
screaming	1
for	0
air	0
power	1
there	0

there	0
were	0
some	1
that	0
were	0
saying	0
the	0
air	1
power	0
wasn't	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

and	0
they	0
seemed	1
to	0
mold	1
the	0
events	1
to	0
their	0
view	0
of	0
the	1
world	1
which	1
i	0
suppose	1
just	0
about	1
everyone	1
does	1
but	0

but	0
these	0
guys	1
had	1
a	0
a	1
uh	0
national	1
soap	1
box	0
to	1
stand	1
on	1
and	1
and	1
express	1
this	0
view	1

you	1
know	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
best	1
uh	1
television	1
news	1
shows	0
that	0
i	1
saw	0
during	1
the	0
war	0
was	0
a	0
show	1
on	1
a	0
saturday	1
morning	1
on	0
abc	1
and	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
for	0
children	1

and	0
it	0
was	0
hosted	1
by	0
peter	0
jennings	0
and	0
it	0
was	0
so	1
interesting	1
because	0
they	1
were	0
relating	1
the	1
war	1
to	0
these	0
children	1
in	0
their	0
studio	1
and	0
they	0
also	0
had	0
children	0
calling	0
in	0
live	1
from	0
all	0
over	0
the	0
country	1
and	0
asking	0
questions	1
and	0
they	0
they	0
had	0
all	1
their	0
correspondents	1
in	0
the	1
different	0
areas	1
in	0
saudi	1
arabia	1
and	0
israel	1
and	0
and	1
all	1
they	0
had	1
them	0
all	1
uh	1
on	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
you'd	0
call	1
it	0
other	0
than	0
on	0
line	0
they	0

they	0
had	0
them	0
all	0
on	0
hold	1
and	0

and	0
if	0
a	0
child	1
asked	0
a	0
question	0
that	0
the	0
person	1
in	0
jerusalem	1
could	0
best	1
answer	1
they	1
would	0
cut	1
to	0
that	0
person	1
and	0
that	0
person	0
would	0
answer	0
the	0
question	1
it	0
was	0
just	0
very	1
informative	1
and	0
interesting	1

and	0
uh	0
i	1
was	0
real	0
impressed	0
at	0
how	0
abc	1
handled	0
uh	0
translating	1
the	0
war	1
for	0
children	1

um-hum	1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
i	0
didn't	0
see	1
anything	0
like	0
that	0
although	1
i	0
did	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	0
one	1
thing	0
that	1
i	1
found	0
sort	1
of	1
interesting	1
this	0
is	1
getting	1
a	1
little	1
off	0
the	0
topic	1
but	1

but	1
there	0
there	1
is	0
a	1
a	0
big	1
push	1
you	1
kn[ow]	1
with	1
the	0
local	1
t	0
v	1
stations	1
to	0
have	0
little	0
hot	1
lines	1
with	0
um	0
counselors	1
to	1
to	0
help	1
parents	0
uh	0
learn	0
how	0
to	0
talk	1
about	0
their	0
war	0
with	0
their	0
children	1

i	0

i	0
thought	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
really	0
unusual	1
thing	0

and	1
our	0
local	1
heb	1
stores	0
here	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
heb	0
statewide	1
or	0
whatever	0
but	0
they	1
have	0
videos	1
that	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	1
they	0
still	0
have	1
them	0
but	0

but	0
they	0
were	0
free	1
rental	0
videos	1
that	0
had	0
something	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
the	0
war	1

um-hum	0

uh	0

uh	0
it	1
was	0

it	1
was	0
right	1
it	0

it	0
was	0
something	1
for	0
children	1
that	1
that	0
they	0
they	0
had	0
several	1
advertisements	1
on	0
television	1
pushing	0
parents	1
going	0
and	0
and	0
uh	0
getting	1
the	0
video	0
and	0
watching	1
it	0
with	0
their	0
children	0
and	0
discussing	1
it	0
and	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	0

um-hum	0
i	1
suppose	1
that	0
is	1
a	0
valuable	1
service	1
that	0

again	1
not	0
having	1
uh	0
lived	1
through	0
another	0
war	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
that's	1
a	0
common	1
thing	0
that	0
people	0
thought	1
of	0
or	0
if	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
a	0
new	1
concern	1
with	0
people	0

well	1
back	1
during	0
the	0
vietnam	1
conflict	1
that	0
no	1
one	0
will	0
will	0
have	1
the	1
guts	0
enough	0
to	0
call	0
a	0
real	0
war	1

uh	0

uh	0
the	1
that	0
type	1
of	1
technology	1
just	1
wasn't	1
at	1
people's	0
disposal	1

that's	0
true	1

that's	0
true	1

so	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
there's	0
ever	0
been	1
a	0
war	0
that's	0
been	0
so	0
thoroughly	1
covered	1
by	0
the	0
news	1

and	0
probably	0
more	0
importantly	1
one	0
that	1
lasted	1
short	1
enough	0
that	1
that	0
people's	0
interest	1
didn't	1
flauge	1
too	0
badly	1

yeah	0
i	1
tell	0
you	0
what	1
the	0

the	0
first	1
three	0
days	1
i	1
was	0
glued	1
to	0
the	0
television	1

i	1
will	0
admit	0
the	0
same	0
thing	0
i	0

i	0
would	0
come	0
home	1
and	0
flip	0
on	0
macneil	0
lehrer	1
and	0

and	0
they	0
would	0
run	0
these	0
extended	1
two	1
three	1

hour	0
versions	1
of	0
the	0
program	0

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
i	1
was	0
just	0
i	1
was	0
horrified	1
and	0
[laughter-fascinated]	1
by	0
what	0
i	0
was	0
seeing	1

i	1
tell	1
you	0
what	1
the	0
the	0
uh	0
war	1
start[ed]	0
let's	0
see	0
was	1
it	1
a	1
wednesday	1
or	0
thursday	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
thursday	1
um	0

and	0
friday	1
night	1
i	1
was	0
i	1
stayed	0
up	1
until	0
two	0
o'clock	0
in	0
the	0
morning	1
sitting	1
right	1
dead	1
center	1
in	0
front	0
of	0
my	0
television	1
just	0
watching	1
practically	1
with	0
my	0
mouth	1
hanging	1
open	1

because	0
i	1
was	1
watching	1
cnn	1
and	0
they	1
would	0
they	0
would	0
switch	1
back	1
to	0
the	1
one	0
of	1
their	0
israel	1
bureaus	1
and	0
the	0
people	1
would	0
be	0
standing	0
there	1
in	1
gas	1
masks	0
and	0
you'd	0
be	1
hearing	1
the	1
sirens	1
and	0
it	0
was	1
just	0

i	1
was	0
amazed	1

um-hum	1
um-hum	0
i	1
i	0
didn't	0
have	0
that	0
experience	1
i	0

i	0
i	0
don't	0
have	0
cable	1
so	0

so	0

so	0
i	1
i'm	0
pretty	1
much	0
limited	0
to	0
pbs	1
which	0
i	0
thought	0
i	1
thought	0
they	0
did	0
a	0
very	0
good	0
job	0

um	0
i've	1
got	0
one	1
question	1
for	0
you	0
i	1

i	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
take	0
the	0
newspaper	1

um-hum	0

um	0
i	0
i	1
found	0
the	0
newspaper	1
situation	0
in	0
dallas	1
very	0
interesting	0
we've	0

we've	0
got	0
the	0
one	1
fairly	1
well	0
relatively	1
weaker	0
paper	0
the	0
times	1
herald	1
and	0
then	0
the	0
morning	0
news	1
which	0
has	0
a	0
very	0
strong	0
subscription	1

does	0
san	1
antonio	0
ha[ve]	0
you	0

you	0
said	0
san	1
antonio	0
right	1

do	0
you	1
have	0
just	0
one	0
paper	0
or	0

or	0
do	0
you	0
have	0
several	1

no	1
there	1
are	0
two	1
and	0
they're	1
pretty	0
close	0
uh	0
the	0
one	1
that	0
i	0
picked	1
is	0
more	0
similar	0
in	0
format	1
to	0
the	0
newspaper	1

i	1
grew	0
up	0
near	0
houston	0
and	0

and	0
there	0
are	0
two	1
major	0
newspapers	0
there	0
that	0
run	1
pretty	0
much	0
neck	0
and	0
neck	0

and	0
the	0
one	1
i	0
picked	0
here	1
had	0
the	0
same	0
format	1
as	0
the	0
one	1
that	0
my	0
parents	1
took	0
as	0
i	0
was	0
growing	0
up	0
i	0
mean	0
the	0
same	1
type	1
of	0
typeface	1
on	0
the	0
headline	1
and	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	0
i	0

i	0
mean	0

it's	1
piddley	1
stuff	0
to	0
pick	0
a	0
newspaper	1
over	1
and	0
i	1
enjoy	0

the	0
comics	1
are	0
better	0
in	0
this	0
newspaper	0
like	0
this	1
newspaper	0
has	0
the	0
far	0
side	1
and	0
some	0
other	0
comics	1
that	0
i	0
enjoy	1
and	0
the	0
other	0
one	0
has	0
some	0
weird	1
ones	0
that	0
i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0

so	0

i	1
i	1
actually	0
take	0
both	1
newspapers	0
on	0
the	0
weekends	1
i	0

i	0
figure	0
i'm	0
only	0
taking	1
on	0
the	0
weekend	1
and	0

and	0
i	0
can	0
afford	1
that	0

yeah	1

i	0
i	0
find	1
the	0
news	1
reporting	0
in	0
the	0
the	0
mourning	1
news	1
to	0
be	0
better	1
but	0
i	0
i	1
sort	0
of	0
have	0
a	0
liberal	1
political	1
slant	0
and	1

and	1
the	0
mourning	1
news	0
just	0
has	1
an	0
incredibly	1
conservative	1
editorial	1
um	0
outlook	1

still	0
i	0
i	0

i	0
get	0
the	0
times	1
herald	1
just	0
to	0
balance	1
that	0
out	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0

he	1
takes	0
both	1
san	0
antonio	0
papers	0
an	0
austin	1
paper	0
both	1
houston	0
papers	1
i	0
guess	1
he	0
takes	0
seven	1
the	0
san	0
marcos	1
paper	0
and	0
the	0
new	0
braunsfel	1
paper	0
but	0
he's	1
a	0
football	1
coach	0
at	0
southwest	0
texas	0
state	0
university	1
so	0

so	0
he's	1
getting	0
all	0
the	0
sports	1
sections	0

and	0

and	0
so	1
you	1
know	0
he	0
has	0
these	0
stacks	1
of	0
sunday	0
newspapers	0
that	0
go	0
unread	1
unless	0

well	1
anyway	1
i	1
uh	1
i	1
uh	1
oh	1
i	1
i	1
did	1
forget	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
name	1
by	1
the	1
way	1

um	1
i'm	1
ann	1

oh	1
you're	1
ann	1
hi	1
but	1
um	1
anyway	1
i	1
uh	1
lot	1
of	1
lot	1
of	1
s[tuff]	1
interesting	1
procedural	1
things	1
i	0
think	1
we	1
could	1
we	1
could	1
change	1
if	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
talking	1
about	0
the	1
subject	1
to[night]	0
tonight	1
which	1
is	1
some	1
i	1
guess	1
criminal	1
courts	1
the	1

criminal	1
courts	1
yes	1

yeah	1
the	1
the	0
one	1
of	0
which	1
was	1
uh	1
something	1
something	1
that's	1
been	0
going	1
on	1
because	0
of	1
the	0
rodney	1
king	1
trial	1
here	0
in	0
town	1
and	0
that	1
is	0
uh	0
and	0
that	1
is	0
the	0
exclusion	1
of	0
jurors	1
because	1
of	0
or	0
in	0
spite	1
of	0
their	0
race	1
uh	1
ye[ah]	1

oh	1
really	1

yeah	1
well	1
the	1
the	1
uh	1
the	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
the	0
the	0
the	0
uh	1
the	0
jury	1
that's	0
trying	1
uh	0
the	0
officers	1
in	0
that	1
case	1
is	1
is	1
an	0
all	1
white	1
panel	1

right	1

and	1
there's	1
been	0
a	0
lot	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
local	1
papers	1
of	0
that	0
fact	1

how	0
is	1
it	0

i	0
can't	1
i'm	1
a	0
little	0
surprised	1
they	0
didn't	0
get	0
a	0
change	1
of	0
venue	1
on	0
that	1
one	0

they	0
have	1
they	0
have	1
they	1
moved	1
it	0
up	1
to	1
the	1
county	1
north	1
of	0
here	0

oh	1

um	1
it's	0
in	1
ventura	1
and	1
there's	0
there's	0
still	1
quite	1
a	0
bit	0
of	0
publicity	1
obviously	1
and	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
debatable	1
whether	1
you	0
could	0
get	0
a	0
fair	1
trial	1
almost	0
anywhere	1
because	0
that	1
uh	0
that	1

well	0
that	0
videotape	1
was	1
just	1
horrible	1

yeah	1
it	1
was	1
everywhere	1

yeah	1

so	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
i	1
i	1
think	0
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
someone	0
uh	1
find	1
a	1
panel	1
that	0
would	1
be	0
not	1
have	1
seen	1
it	0
and	0
and	0
known	1
of	0
what	1
was	0
going	0
on	0

oh	0
i	1
agree	1
with	0
you	1
but	0
i	0
can't	1
imagine	1
that	0
they	0
would	0
do	1
an	0
all	1
white	1
jury	1
without	1
having	0
some	1
sort	1
of	0
of	1
discrimination	1
or	1
or	1
you	0
know	1
uh	0
appeal	1
on	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
jury	1
of	1
his	0
peers	1
and	0
all	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
stuff	1

exactly	1
you	1
know	1
um	0
the	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i'm	1
kind	0
of	0
torn	1
on	0
this	0
issue	1
it's	0
like	1
they're	0
saying	1
well	1
on	1
the	0
one	1
hand	0
they're	0
not	1
he's	1
not	0
getting	0
a	0
jury	1
of	0
his	0
peers	1
which	1
is	1
in	0
some	1
ways	1
i	1
think	1
true	1
but	1
on	1
the	0
other	1
hand	1
is	1
it's	0
also	1
saying	0
that	1
white	1
jurors	1
are	1
not	1
going	0
to	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
convict	1

right	1

uh	1
you	1
know	0
they're	1
not	1
going	0
to	0
do	0
their	1
job	1
which	0
is	0
the	0
whole	1
the	1
whole	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
on	1
a	1
jury	0
is	1
to	0
convict	1
or	1
or	1
or	0
uh	1
let	1
go	0
based	1
on	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	0
evidence	1
says	1
that	0
there's	0
enough	0

exactly	1

based	1
on	0
fact	1
right	1

how	1
interesting	1
ooh	1
so	1
what's	1
the	0
prevailing	1
thought	1
within	1
the	0
community	1

um	1

i	1
mean	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
the	1
news	1
media's	0
gonna	1
make	1
of	0
it	1
but	1
what	1
about	1
the	1
community	1

they	1
well	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
depends	1
on	0
who	1
you	0
talk	0
to	0
i	1
haven't	0
talked	1
to	0
uh	0
i	0
haven't	1
talked	0
to	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	0
of	0
black	1
people	0
on	0
it	0
but	0
i	0
i	0
rather	1
imagine	1
there's	0
there's	1
some	1
snickering	1
about	1
it	0
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
usually	1
fatalistic	1
oh	0
here	1
we	0
go	0
again	1
folks	1
kind	0
of	1
stuff	1

uh-huh	1

oh	0
my	1
goodness	1
that	1
can't	1
be	0
good	1
for	0
los	1
angeles	1
either	1

no	1
no	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
on	1
on	0
on	1
one	1
hand	1
y[ou]	0
on	1
the	0
one	1
hand	1
you	0
almost	1
hope	1
that	1
they	1
convict	1
them	1
because	1
it's	0
th[ey]	1
they	0
have	1
that	1
very	1
strong	1
piece	1
of	0
physical	1
evidence	1
showing	1
these	1
people	0
beating	1
the	0
heck	1
out	0
of	1
this	1
guy	1
um	0

oh	0
exactly	1

unfortunately	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
is	0
not	1
limited	1
to	1
uh	0
a	0
big	0
city	1
like	0
los	0
angeles	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
just	1
about	1
anywhere	1

um-hum	0

there	1

well	0

but	1
that's	0
that's	0
interesting	1

yeah	0
um	0

what	1
about	1
the	1
judge	1
who's	0
hearing	1
the	1
case	1
is	0
he	1
gonna	1
be	0
impartial	1
is	0
he	1
going	0
to	1
be	0
a	0
g[ood]	0
a	0
good	1
adjudicator	1

i	1
don't	0
know	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
and	0
again	1
there's	0
something	1
else	1
th[at]	0
you	0
know	0
there	1
was	0
a	0
uh	0
i[t]	0
something	1
else	1
along	0
those	0
lines	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
girl	1
out	1
here	1
named	1
latausha	1
harlins	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
this	1
this	0
got	1
this	1
got	0
as	0
much	0
notoriety	1
but	0
it's	0
rather	1
almost	1
as	0
infamous	1
here	1
as	0
it	0
was	1
as	0
it	0
was	1
with	0
uh	0
the	0
rodney	1
king	1
problem	1
um	0
girl	1
walked	0
into	0
a	0
korean	1
owned	0
store	1
and	1
uh	0
they	1
she	0
had	1
a	0
dispute	1
black	1
girl	0

uh-huh	1

she	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
kind	0
of	1
a	0
dispute	1
over	0
some	0
orange	1
juice	0
with	1
the	0
with	0
the	0
owner	1
of	0
the	0
store	1
the	0
owner	1
of	0
the	0
store	1
popped	1
her	0

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
well	1
of	0
course	1
the	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
criminal	1
case	0
went	1
up	1
and	0
and	0
the	0
judge	1
gave	0
the	0
woman	1
who	1
shot	1
her	0
shot	1
the	1
girl	1
a	1
uh	0
uh	1
practically	1
a	0
suspended	1
sentence	1
i	1
mean	1
it	1
was	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
she	1

oh	0
my	1
goodness	1

she	1
gave	0
her	0
no	1
time	0
in	0
jail	1
and	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
all	1
of	0
these	0
things	1
and	0
then	0
oh	1
there's	0
uh	0
we	1
have	0
these	0
we	0
have	1
people	1
wandering	1
around	1
to	0
with	1
petitions	1
trying	0
to	0
get	1
the	1
judge	1

to	1
get	1
that	0
judge	1
recalled	1
i	0
would	1
think	1

yeah	1
yeah	1

hm	1
that's	1
almost	1
when	1
you	0
kind	1
of	0
wish	1
that	1
there	1
where	1
st[andardized]	0
standardized	1
sentences	1

yeah	1
it	1
would	0
make	1
it	0
would	0
make	1
life	0
easier	1

it	1
would	1
uh	1

yeah	1
but	1

uh	1
you	1

but	1

you	1
would	0
know	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
would	0
know	1
what	1
you	0
were	0
facing	1
and	0
then	1
it's	1
a	0
matter	1
of	0
of	0
deciding	1
g[uilt]	1

do	1
you	1
know	1
anyone	1
that	1
uh	1
has	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
or	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
one	1

no	1
but	1
i	1
my	1
grandparents	1
were	1
looking	1
into	1
it	1
before	1
so	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
they've	1
said	1

uh-huh	1

um-hum	1

well	1
i'm	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
my	1
uh	1
uh	1
wife's	1
grandmother	1
had	1
alzheimer's	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
and	1
uh	1
they	1
when	1
they	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
she	1
had	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
the	1
nursing	1
home	1
made	1
them	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
her	0
back	1
because	0
she	1
was	1
being	1
a	1
a	1
you	1
know	1
a	1
a	0
nuisance	1
or	0
worse	1
than	1
a	1
nuisance	1
i	0
mean	1
sh[e]	0
she	1
sort	1
of	0
went	0
you	1
know	0
bananas	1
and	1

oh	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
was	0
too	1
much	1
of	0
a	1
bother	1

and	1
they	0
couldn't	1
couldn't	1
deal	1
with	0
her	0
so	1
i	1
guess	1
you	0
need	1
to	1
uh	1
know	1
whether	1
it's	1
a	1
you	1
know	1
no	1
deposit	1
no	0
return	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
whether	1

right	1
if	1
they're	1
equipped	1
too	1
to	0
handle	1
the	0
kind	1
of	1
patients	1
you're	1
gonna	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
put	0
in	1
there	1
too	1

yeah	1

because	1
i	1
know	1
my	1
grandparents	1
wanted	1
to	0
have	1
some	1
independence	1
still	1

right	1

they	1
wanted	1
someplace	1
they	1
can	1
go	1
and	1
have	1
their	1
meals	1
and	1
a	1
nurse	1
on	1
staff	1
just	1
in	1
case	1
they	1
needed	1
her	0
but	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
independent	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
their	0
own	1
room	1

right	1

my	0
grandmother	1
actually	1
was	0
in	0
a	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
that	0
um	1
there	1
was	1
a	0
retirement	1
hotel	1
and	0
then	0
a	1
uh	1
there	0
was	0
some	1
sort	1
of	0
full-time	1
care	1
place	1
that	0
was	0
also	1
associated	1
with	0
it	1
so	1
for	1
um	0
the	0
first	1
few	1
years	0
she	0
had	1
her	1
own	1
apartment	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
made	1
her	1
own	1
meals	1
sometimes	1
but	1
could	1
could	0
also	1
go	1
and	0
eat	1
someplace	1
else	1

um-hum	1

and	0
then	1
um	0
as	1
she	0
became	1
less	1
able	0
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
herself	0
then	1
she	0
moved	1
into	0
this	0
other	1
part	1
that	0
was	1
able	1
to	1
um	1
provide	1
full-time	1
care	1
and	1
um	0
she	1
didn't	1
have	1
to	1
do	0
anything	1
anymore	1
but	1
my	1
experience	0
has	1
been	0
that	0
most	1
people	1
that	0
move	0
into	1
nursing	1
homes	1
die	1
very	1
quickly	1
and	1
that's	1
some	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
whether	0
that's	1
because	1
they	1
you	0
know	1
sort	1
of	1
give	1
up	0
hope	1
once	0
they	0
get	1
in	1
there	1
or	0
what	1
the	0
what	1
the	0
reason	1
is	1
but	0
i	1
think	0
the	1
average	1
length	1
of	0
time	1
that	0
somebody	0
lives	1
in	0
a	1
nursing	1
home	0
is	1
only	1
like	1
six	1
months	1
or	1
something	0

well	1
a	1
lot	0
of	1
that's	1
probably	0
to	0
do	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	0
people	1
go	1
to	1
it	1
because	1
they	1
need	1
help	1

yeah	1

they	1
need	1
health	0
care	1
so	0
they're	1
already	1
ill	1
before	0
they	0
go	1

right	1

that's	1
probably	1
a	1
large	0
factor	1

yeah	1
if	0
if	0
you	1
can	0
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself	0
at	0
all	1
or	0
have	1
someone	1
that	0
can	1
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	0
then	1
you	0
stay	1
where	0
you	1
are	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
only	0
go	1
there	0
as	0
a	0
last	0
resort	1

um-hum	1

or	1
people	1
send	1
you	0
there	0
as	0
a	1
last	0
resort	1

right	1
right	1
that's	1
my	1
grandparents	1
it	1
was	1
just	0
so	0
that	1
the	1
rest	1
of	0
the	1
relatives	1
would	1
have	1
peace	1
of	0
mind	1
knowing	0
that	0
if	0
anything	1
happened	1
there	1
was	0
somebody	0
there	1
for	0
them	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
that	1
was	0
their	1
thinking	0
somebody	1
who	0
would	0
know	1
what	1
to	0
do	1
in	1
the	0
event	1
of	0
an	1
emergency	1

right	0

and	0
also	1
so	0
they	0
could	1
find	1
someplace	1
they	0
enjoyed	1
while	0
they	0
still	1
had	1
choices	1
to	0
make	1
so	0
they	0
wouldn't	1
be	0
stuck	1
going	0
into	0
just	0
whatever	1
nursing	1
home	0
was	0
available	1
at	1
the	1
time	1

right	0

i	0
guess	0
that's	1
a	0
problem	0
too	1
for	1
people	0
wait	1
lists	1
and	0
all	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	1

that	1
um	1
you	1
can't	1
always	1
get	1
in	1
when	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
and	1
of	0
course	1
you	0
can't	1
just	0
sit	1
around	0
and	1
wait	1

right	1
when	0
you	0
need	1
it	0
you	0
need	1
it	0
i	1
guess	1

yeah	1

and	0
the	0
money	1
is	0
also	1
another	0
issue	1
how	1
you're	1
gonna	0
pay	1
for	1
it	0

right	1

at	1
that	1
stage	0
of	1
life	1
you	0
only	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
money	1
left	1
and	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
not	0
exactly	1
fair	1
for	0
the	0
younger	1
family	1
members	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
put	0
in	0
their	1
savings	0

yeah	1

i	0
mean	0
it	0
is	1
kind	0
of	0
fair	1
but	0
it's	1
also	0
not	1
fair	0
because	1
they	0
have	1
their	0
own	1
children	1
to	0
raise	1

sure	1

so	0
that's	1
another	0
problem	1

and	0
you	0
probably	1
if	1
it	0
were	0
you	1
you	0
probably	1
wouldn't	1
want	1
someone	0
choosing	1
a	0
place	1
for	0
you	0
to	0
live	1
based	1
on	0
lowest	0
price	1

right	1
right	1
so	1
it's	1
it's	1
just	0
so	1
complicated	0
anymore	1
i	0
think	0
people	1
outlive	1
their	0
savings	1
and	1
with	0
medicine	1
being	1
the	0
way	1
it	0
is	0
you're	0
extending	1
life	1
where	0
sometimes	1
the	0
quality	1
of	0
living	1
has	0
gone	1
down	1
and	0
they're	0
not	1
necessarily	1
enjoying	1
life	0
anymore	1

yeah	1
well	1
maybe	1
that's	1
the	0
purpose	1
of	1
the	0
nursing	1
home	0
is	0
to	0
have	0
them	0
go	1
someplace	1
where	0
they	0
can	0
see	1
that	0
it's	0
not	1
worth	0
continuing	1

it's	1
just	1
a	0
shame	1
that's	1
the	0
way	0
it	1
has	0
to	0
be	1
i	1
think	1
the	0
retirement	1
home	0
idea's	0
a	0
nice	1
idea	0
to	0
go	1
and	0
find	1
older	1
people	1
and	0
with	0
similar	1
interests	1
and	0
someplace	1

if	0
i	0
died	1
i'd	0
come	1
back	0
as	0
a	0
dog	1

what	0
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0

oh	0
yeah	1
yeah	1

that'd	1
be	0
the	1
best	1
way	1
to	0
be	1

yeah	1
um	0
do	0
you	0
like	0
big	1
dogs	0
or	0
or	0
little	1
dogs	0

well	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
german	1
shepherd	1
and	0

and	0
he	1
had	0
dysplasia	1

um-hum	0

and	0
he	1
had	1
it	1
for	0
about	0
three	1
or	1
four	0
years	1
where	0
we	0
just	1
about	0
had	0
to	0
lift	1
him	0
and	0
carry	1
him	0
every	1
place	1
he	0
went	1

really	1

so	1
when	1
he	1
died	1
we	0
got	0
a	0
little	1
one	1

yeah	1

but	0
our	1
shepherd	1
was	0
almost	0
thirteen	1
years	0
old	1
and	0
it	0
just	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
was	0
almost	0
cruel	1
because	1

um-hum	0
almost	1

almost	1
cruel	1
for	0
him	0
to	0
to	0
walk	1

yeah	1
he	1
just	0
he	1
couldn't	0
get	0
up	1
he	0
couldn't	0
walk	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	0
twenty	0
pounds	1

it	0
was	0
a	0
chore	1

wow	1
yeah	1

so	0
we	1
said	0
the	0
next	1
time	0
around	1
we'd	0
get	1
[laughter-something]	1
[laughter-little]	1
[laughter-that]	1
[laughter-if]	0
something	1
happened	1
it	0
would	0
be	1
easier	1
to	0
carry	1

sure	1

yeah	1
it	0

and	0
then	1
we've	0
had	0
three	1
cats	1
in	1
our	1
married	1
life	1
and	0
we've	0
got	1
a	0
calico	1
now	1

yeah	1
we've	1
got	0
a	0
calico	1
cat	1
too	1

do	1
you	0

yeah	1
yeah	1
she's	1
the	0
she's	1
the	0
nice	1
one	0
yeah	0
we	1
um	0
we	1
used	0
to	0
live	1
in	0
an	0
apartment	1
and	0
like	0
our	0
cats	1
never	1
went	0
outside	1
but	1
um	0
the	0
neighbors	1
used	1
to	0
let	0
their	0
dogs	1
out	0
and	0
our	0
neighbors	1
were	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
kind	1
of	0
slimy	1
and	0
um	0
our	1
cats	0
wound	1
up	0
getting	0
fleas	1
um	0
from	0
the	0
apartment	1
that	0
we	0
were	0
in	1

um	1

so	1
we	1
had	0
to	0
we	0
had	0
to	0
flea	1
bath	0
them	0
and	0
that	0
was	1
uh	0
that	1
was	1
an	1
experience	1
that	0
they	1
didn't	0
enjoy	1
at	1
all	0

yeah	0
well	1
don't	1
even	0
talk	1
to	0
me	0
i	0
when	0
i	1
was	1
single	1
i	1
had	0
gone	1
away	1
for	1
the	1
weekend	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
my	0
husband	1
then	0
fiance	1
was	1
to	0
keep	1
my	0
cat	1
and	0
he	0
let	1
her	0
out	1
and	1
my	0
house	1
was	1
loaded	1
with	0
fleas	1
i	1
mean	0
you	0
walked	1
in	1
and	1
your	0
legs	1
were	0
just	0
black	1

really	1

and	0
we	1
had	0
such	1
a	0
time	1
and	0
never	1
got	0
the	0
cat	1

really	1

yeah	1
i	0
found	1
it	0
you	1
know	1
in	1
the	0
street	1

ah	0

was	1
a	1
social	1
worker	0
at	1
the	0
time	1
and	0
found	1
that	0
it	0

okay	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
um	1
this	1
is	1
probably	1
really	1
a	1
good	1
subject	1
for	1
me	1
because	1
i	1
really	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
uh	1
hand	1
work	1
uh	1
mostly	1
i	1
do	1
needlepoint	1
i	1
guess	1

oh	1
really	1

but	1
um	0

what	1
kinds	1
of	1
things	1
have	1
you	1
done	1

um	1
well	1
i've	1
made	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
baby	0
gifts	1

aha	1

it	1
seem	1
like	1
that's	1
like	1
especially	1
lately	1
there's	1
been	1
so	0
many	1
babies	1
that	1
uh	1
bibs	1
and	0
blankets	1
and	0
things	1
like	1
that	0
wall	1
hangings	0
um	0

do	1
you	1
ever	1
keep	1
any	0
of	0
your	1
stuff	1

isn't	1
that	0
funny	1
no	0

i	1
do	0
crochet	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
uh	1
things	1
like	0
that	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
very	0
little	1
of	0
my	1
own	1
stuff	1
and	1
and	1
it	1
it's	1
kind	1
of	1
embarrassing	0
people	1
say	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
work	1

oh	1
well	1
can	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
so	1
and	1

yeah	0
isn't	1
that	1
funny	1
i	1
guess	1
i	1
do	1
have	1
one	1
thing	1
um	1
a	1
friend	1
of	0
mine	0
gave	0
me	1
a	0
clock	1
kit	1
and	1

ooh	0

and	1
i	1
i	1
needlepointed	1
the	0
the	0
face	1
and	1
i	1
uh	1
kept	0
that	1
because	1
she	1
gave	1
me	1
that	1
so	1

that	1
that	0
would	1
be	1
definitely	1
something	1
you'd	0
want	1
to	1
keep	1

oh	1
yeah	1
and	0
it's	0
real	0
neat	1

was	1
was	1
the	1
whole	1
face	1
done	1
or	0
just	1
the	1
numbers	1
uh	1
and	1
and	1
like	1
minute	0
marks	1

um	0
basically	1
the	0
the	0
whole	1
well	1
no	0
i	1
guess	0
the	1
minute	0
marks	0
but	1
the	0
minute	1
marks	0
are	1
done	1
they're	0
like	1
hearts	0

oh	1

and	1
then	1
the	0
at	1
the	1
numbers	1
they	1
they're	1
kind	0
of	0
outlined	1
and	0
stuff	1
it	1
it	1
was	0
quite	1
bit	0
of	1
work	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
it	1
was	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
too	1
i	1
really	1
like	0
doing	1
stuff	1
like	1
that	1
so	1

i	1
did	1
some	0
needlepoint	1
years	1
ago	1
and	0
then	1
i	1
got	1
into	0
the	0
bargello	1

oh	0
what's	0
that	0

well	1
it's	1
an	0
italian	1
um	0
needlework	1
using	1
using	1
the	0
uh	1
i	1
started	1
to	0
say	0
the	1
canvas	1
but	1
the	1
uh	1
hum	0
the	1
what	0
what	0
kind	1
of	0
cloth	1
uses	1
that	1
i	1
i've	1
just	0
gone	0
blank	1
but	1
it's	1
used	1
wi[th]	0
uh	1
with	1
yarn	1
and	1
it	1
usually	1
takes	1
long	1
stitches	1
over	0
two	1
or	1
three	1
openings	1
in	0
the	1
cloth	1

huh	0

and	1
you	0
weave	1
intricate	0
patterns	1
and	0
use	1
different	0
colors	1
like	1
it	1
could	0
be	1
a	1
flame	1
stitch	1
where	0
so	1
rather	1
than	1
drawing	1
a	1
picture	1
you're	1
making	1
a	1
design	1
like	1
a	1
geometric	1
or	1
whatever	1
and	1
it	1
was	0
used	1
quite	1
often	1
in	1
the	0
colonial	1
times	1
to	0
uh	0
uh	1
to	0
upholster	1
chairs	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
as	0
well	1
as	1
the	1
crewel	1
um	1
embroidery	1
work	1
that	0
was	0
done	1
on	1
them	0

wow	1
well	1
that's	0
interesting	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
what	0
kind	1
of	0
things	1
did	0
you	1
do	1

what	1
i	1
did	1
when	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
doing	1
that	1
was	1
mostly	1
pillows	0
you	1
know	0
for	1
sofas	0
and	1
so	0
forth	1
and	1
i	1
can't	1
find	0
one	1
that	0
i've	1
done	1

oh	0

it's	1
one	0
of	1
those	0
things	1
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	1
give	0
them	1
away	1
but	1
i	1
didn't	0
know	1
if	1
it's	0
been	1
my	1
color	1
choice	1
or	0
multiple	1
moves	1
or	1
or	1
what	1
and	1

yeah	0

and	1
it	0
i	1
was	1
so	0
proud	1
of	0
them	0
when	1
i	0
got	1
them	1
finished	1
but	0
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	0
where	0
they	0
are	1

what	0

i've	0
never	1

of	0
that	0
before	1
i've	0
probably	1

have	0

i	0
mean	0
when	0
you	0
described	0
it	0

you	0
know	0
that	0
would	0
be	1
around	1
i	1
guess	0
but	1
um	0
i've	0
never	1
heard	1
of	0
it	0
before	0
and	0
it's	0
really	0
interesting	0
um	0
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
decorated	1
baskets	1
and	0
stuff	0
before	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
but	0
i've	0
kind	1

you	0
know	0

like	0
fabric	0
that's	0
been	0
stiffened	1
in	0

yeah	0

yes	1

i've	1
never	0
done	1
that	1
and	0
those	1
are	0
so	0
neat	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
would	0
really	1
like	1
to	0
do	0
those	1
but	1
um	0

i've	0
seen	0
some	0
and	0
there	0
there	0
they	0
i	0
suspect	1
they're	0
fairly	0
simple	1
because	0
the	0
one	1
lady	0
i've	0
seen	1
i	0
know	1
that	0
does	1
it	0
i've	0
never	0
asked	1
her	0
any	0
questions	1
but	0
she	1
has	0
three	1
kids	0
all	1
under	0
the	0
age	1
of	0
like	0
six	1

and	1
and	0
they're	1
all	1
a	0
handful	1
so	0
it's	0
got	1
to	0
be	0
something	0
she	1
can	0
do	0
fairly	1
easily	0
and	0
fairly	1
quickly	0

oh	0
definitely	0
yeah	0

when	1
i	0
do	1
um	0
crochet	1
it's	0
it's	0
usually	1
the	0
the	0
lacy	1
victorian	1
type	0
things	1
like	1
that	1
and	1

oh	0

and	1
i	1
stiffen	1
those	1
with	0
a	0
a	0
glue	1
mixture	1
it's	0
like	1
white	1
glue	1
and	0
it	1
may	1
be	1
something	1
similar	1
to	0
that	1
that	0
the	0
fabric	1
is	0
dipped	1
in	1
and	1
then	1
um	0
allowed	0
to	0
dry	1
in	0
those	1
those	0
draping	1
bows	1
i	0
mean	0
those	0
draping	1
streamers	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0

oh	0

i	0
was	1
just	1
there's	0
bound	1
to	1
be	0
some	1
kind	0
of	0
fabric	1
stiffener	0
like	1
that	0
that's	1
very	0
similar	1
that's	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
melt	1
too	1
much	1
with	0
uh	0
uh	0
high	1
humidity	1
in	1
in	0
a	0
room	1

yeah	0

that's	1
i	0
think	1
that's	0
what	0
my	1
concern	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
wasn't	1
really	0
sure	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
how	1
they	1
would	0
last	1

do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
my	0
concern	1
is	1
how	0
will	0
i	0
dust	0
this	0
thing	1

you're	0
[laughter-right]	0
no	0

i'm	0
[laughter-terrible]	0

no	0
that's	0
true	0
[laughter-though]	0
that's	0
funny	0

so	0
many	0
of	0
my	0
crafts	0
well	1
right	0
now	1
i'm	0
looking	0
at	0
a	0
little	0
uh	0
uh	0
quilted	1
uh	0
uh	0
hanging	1
it's	1
like	0
it's	1
a	1
flag	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	1
wash	0
it	1
because	0
that	0
would	1
start	1
breaking	0
down	0
the	0
batting	1
and	1
so	0
forth	0
but	0
it's	0
such	1
a	0
dust	1
collector	0
to	0
be	0
out	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
most	1
of	0
my	1
things	0
are	1
dust	1
collectors	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
hate	0
to	0
dust	1

i	1
know	0

so	1
that's	0
the	0
first	0
thing	1
i	0
think	0
of	0
is	0
how	1
easy	0
would	0
this	0
thing	0
be	0
to	0
clean	1

that's	0
funny	0
no	0
i	0
just	0
um	0
i	1
don't	0
i	1
have	0
really	1
have	0
gotten	1
out	1
of	0
it	0
i	0
don't	1
do	1
it	0
quite	0
as	0
much	1
as	0
i	0
used	1
to	1
um	1
i	0
guess	1
because	1
i	0
i	0
went	1
back	0
to	0
school	1
so	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
as	0
much	0
time	1

oh	0
you	0
don't	1
have	0
time	1

now	0
and	0
i	1
have	1
two	0
children	1
[laughter-also]	0
[laughter-so]	0

you	0
definitely	1
don't	0
have	0
[laughter-time]	0

it	0
keeps	0
me	0
very	0
busy	0
but	0
i	1
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
do	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
get	0
the	0
chance	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	0
it's	0
so	1
relaxing	1
to	0
just	0
sit	1
and	0
but	0
once	1
i	0
get	0
started	1
i	0
can't	1
put	0
it	0
down	1
i	0
just	0

i	0
have	0
a	0
similar	1
problem	0
i've	0
got	1
to	0
have	0
time	1
or	0
i	0
don't	0
even	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
into	1
it	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

and	0
so	1
i	0
end	1
up	1
lots	0
of	1
time	1
not	1
doing	0
anything	0
at	1
all	1

i	0
know	0
i	0
started	1
a	0
project	1
it's	0
been	1
over	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
that	0
i	0
swore	1
i	0
was	0
going	1
to	0
finish	1
for	0
somebody	1
for	0
[laughter-christmas]	1
and	0

you	0
just	1
didn't	1
say	1
which	0
christmas	1
right	1

that's	1
what	0
i	0
keep	0
telling	1
this	0
[laughter-person]	1
well	0
i	0
didn't	1
tell	1
you	0
what	0
year	1

what	0
was	0
this	0
project	0

um	1
well	1
it's	1
a	0
it's	0
uh	1
cross	1
stitch	0
and	1
it's	0
a	0
picture	1
and	0
it's	0
a	0
wildlife	1
it	0
has	0
deer	1
and	0
trees	1
and	0
it's	0
really	0
beautiful	0
but	0
it's	0
going	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
work	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
i	0
have	1
worked	0
on	0
it	1
quite	0
a	1
bit	0
but	0
not	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
just	1
so	0
hard	1

now	0
this	0
is	1
this	0
is	0
done	0
in	0
the	0
needlepoint	1

uh-huh	0
uh	0
well	0
i	0
shouldn't	0
it's	0
counted	1
cross	0
stitch	1
actually	1
is	0
what	0
i'm	0
doing	0
and	0
so	0
it's	0
really	1
since	0
it's	0
counted	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
work	1

yes	0
yes	0
i	0
do	0
know	0
i	0

yep	0

i	0
have	0
done	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
of	0
that	1
but	0
i've	0
decided	1
that	0
that's	0
something	0
that	0
demands	1
my	0
time	1
my	1
my	0
to[tal]	1
my	0
total	1
attention	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
i've	0
got	0
to	0
have	1
total	1
almost	0
total	1
silence	0
i	0
can't	1
really	0
watch	1
television	0
if	0
the	0
pattern	1
is	0
very	0
intricate	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you'd	0
have	1
lots	0
of	0
shading	1
on	0
that	0
particular	1
piece	1
it	0

uh-huh	0

yep	0

it	0
is	0
not	1
does	0
not	0
sound	0
like	0
an	0
easy	1
one	0
to	0
finish	1

no	0
it	0
really	0
isn't	0
and	0
i	0
tell	0
you	0
really	1
i	0
could	0
just	0
kick	1
myself	0
for	0
even	1
starting	1
[laughter-it]	0
because	0
i	0
have	0
a	0
feeling	1
i'm	0
never	1
going	0
to	1
get	1
it	0
done	1
i'm	1
probably	1
going	0
to	0
hear	1
about	0
it	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
[laughter-my]	0
[laughter-life]	1

oh	0
i'm	0
sure	0
you'll	0
get	0
it	0
done	0
but	0
it	0
just	0
maybe	0
not	0
on	0
the	0
original	0
obviously	0
not	0
on	0
the	0
original	0
time	0
schedule	0

no	1
that's	0
true	0
i	1
i	1
just	1
don't	1
know	0
when	1
i'm	0
ever	1
it	0
just	1
seems	1
like	0
there's	1
just	0
never	1
enough	0
time	1
to	0
to	1
pick	1
it	1
up	0
and	1
do	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
really	0
hard	1
but	0
i	0
really	0
do	0
en[joy]	0
like	0
i	0
said	0
i	0
really	1
enjoy	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
it's	0
just	0
hard	0

just	0
hard	0
finding	1
the	0
time	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
dedicated	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	1
many	0
other	0
things	1
that	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
done	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
meantime	1
like	0
i	0
said	0
so	0
many	0
baby	1
gifts	0
i've	0
made	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
bibs	1
and	0
wall	1
hangings	0
and	0
so	1
you	1
know	0
those	1
don't	0
take	1
much	0
time	0
at	0
all	1
so	0
it's	0
no	0
big	0
deal	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
pick	1
those	0
up	1
and	0
do	1
them	0

do	0
you	1
do	0
you	1
use	0
patterns	1
i	0
mean	0
like	0
a	0
book	1
of	0
patterns	1
or	0
do	0
you	0
go	0
out	0
an	0
buy	1
a	0
a	0
kit	1
like	1
for	0
a	0
bib	0
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

no	0
no	0
i	0
usually	1
just	0
buy	0
a	0
pattern	1
book	1
i	0
have	1
several	1
pattern	1
books	0
and	0
i	0
just	1
go	0
with	0
those	1

okay	0

and	0
then	1
i	0
buy	1
the	0
bibs	1
separate	1
usually	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
cheaper	1
in	0
the	0
long	1
run	1
and	0
then	0
i	1
just	0
use	0
whatever	1
colors	1
i	0
want	0
to	0
i	0
don't	0
usually	0
use	1
the	0
colors	0
they	0
tell	1
me	0
to	0

um	0

and	1
it	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
what	1
it	0
is	1
you	0
know	0
but	1
some	1
things	0
especially	1
letters	1
if	1
they	0
suggest	1
certain	1
colors	1
for	0
letters	1
i	1
just	1
go	1
with	0
whatever	1
i	0
want	1
to	0

that's	0
what	0
i	0
would	0
do	0
too	1

yeah	0
i	0
yeah	1
yeah	0

or	0
or	0
whatever	0
i	0
have	0
[laughter-that's]	0

there's	1
yeah	1
there's	1
a	0
a	0
few	1
designs	0
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
done	0
myself	1
but	0
not	1
very	0
many	1
real	0
simple	1
ones	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
do	1
i've	0
made	1
i	0
made	1
a	0
little	1
uh	0
uh	0
little	1
uh	0
little	0
thumb	0
print	1
and	0
made	1
it	0
a	0
bunny	1

ooh	0

it	0
was	0
really	0
easy	0
i	0
mean	0
just	1
just	1
did	0
a	0
thumb	0
print	1
you	0
know	1

what	0
with	0
ink	0

uh-huh	0

oh	0
okay	0

and	0
then	1
see	0
i	0
didn't	1
cross	1
stitch	0
the	0
actual	1
thumb	1
print	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
was	1
just	0
the	0
ink	1
and	0
then	0
i	0
made	1
the	0
ears	1
and	0
little	0
eyes	1
and	0
nose	1
and	0
mouth	1
that	0
was	0
so	0
simple	0
[laughter-and]	0

oh	0
that	0
sounds	0
really	0
neat	0

it	0
didn't	1
take	0
anything	1
at	0
all	1
and	0

did	0
you	0
do	1
did	0
you	0
use	1
like	0
a	0
stamp	0
pad	1
an	0
ink	1
okay	0

um-hum	0
and	0

like	0
being	0
finger	0
