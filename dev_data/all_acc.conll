that	0
was	1
just	0
the	0
ink	1
and	0
then	0
i	0
made	1
the	0
ears	1
and	0
little	0
eyes	1
and	0
nose	1
and	0
mouth	1
that	0
was	0
so	0
simple	0
and	0

just	0
like	0
being	0
finger	0

so	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
any	1
painting	1
projects	1
lately	1

yeah	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
topic	1
for	1
me	1
because_1	1
i	1
just	1
did	1
my	1
first	1
two	1
painting	1
projects	1
ever	1
it	1

oh	1
really	1

was	1
not	1
not	1
a	1
big	1
deal	1

what	1
kind	1
of	1
painting	1
was	1
it	1

two	1
little	1
deals	1

the	1
first	1
one	0
um	1
i	1
helped	1
someone	1
repaint	1
an	1
apartment	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
easy	1

uh-huh	1
it	0
was	1
it	0

yeah	1
and	1
i've	1
never	1
painted	1
anyth[ing]	1
i	1
always	1
thought	1
it	0
would	1
be	1
so	1
you	1
know	1
you'd	1
have	1
to	1
hire	1
someone	0
if	1
you	1
needed	0
to	1
paint	1
inside	1
your	1
house	1
or	1
something	1
but	1

yeah	1

but	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
it	1

oh	0
huh	1

and	1
the	1
second	1
one	1
was	1
i	1
bought	1
some	0
toys	1
at	0
a	1
um	1
at	1
a	1
craft	1
fair	0

uh-huh	1

they're	1
unfinished	1
wooden	1
book	1
ends	1
and	1
stuff	1
for	1
a	0
a	0
little	0
girl	1
for	0
christmas	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
just	1
decided	0
to	0
paint	1
them	1
and	0
that	1
wasn't	0
as	0
easy	1
as	0
painting	1
the	0
apartment	1
was	1

oh	0
w[ell]	0
what	1
kind	1
of	0
paint	1
did	1
you	0
use	1
for	0
the	0
um	1
bookends	1

well	1
it's	1
uh	1
it	1
that's	1
half	1
the	1
problem	1
right	0
there	1
is	1
that	1
it	0
wasn't	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
oil	1
base	0
so	0
i	1
had	1
to	0
get	0
and	1
when	1
i	1
painted	1
them_1	1
i	1
didn't	0
realize	1
that	1
we	0
didn't	0
have	1
any	0
uh	1
turpentine	1
or	0
paint	1
thinner	0
or	1
anything	0
in	1
the	0
house	1
so	1
i	0
had	0
it	1
had	1
it	0
all	1
over	0
my	1
hands	1
at	0
first	1
i	0
didn't	0
realize	0
you	0
know	0
i	1
had	0
never	0
painted	0
anything	1
so	0
i	0
didn't	0
realize	1
that	0
i	0
needed	1
that	0
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
kind	1
of	0
knew	0
in	0
the	0
back	1
of	0
my	0
mind	1

so	1
you	0
can't	1
use	0
oil	1
on	0
wood	1

well	1
no	1
you	1
can	1
use	0
it	1
on	0
wood	1
but	0
i	0
just	0
had	1
it	0
all	0
over	0
my	0
hands	1
and	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
wash	0
the	0
brushes	1
out	0
and	0
uh	0
wash	0
my	0
hands	1
and	0
you	0
can't	1
wash	0
it	0
off	0
with	0
water	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
get	0
the	0
uh	0
a	0
solution	1
and	0

oh	0
so	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
go	0
around	1
with	0
paint	1
all	1
over	0
you	1
temporarily	1
anyway	1

yeah	1
i	1
had	0
to	1
drive	1
to	0
the	0
store	1

yeah	1
i	0
had	1
to	0
drive	0
to	1
the	1
store	1
with	1
paper	0
towels	1
all	0
over	0
my	0
hands	1
to	0
go	0
buy	1
some	0
paint	0
thinner	0
and	0
right	1
back	1
and	0
everything	1
like	0
that	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0
then	0
um	0
uh	0
downstairs	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
apartment	1
i	0
just	0
use[d]	0
we	0
just	0
used	1
a	0
latex	1
base	1
and	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
drip	1
it	0
on	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
dripped	1
it	0
on	0
something	0
as	0
long	0
as	0
you	0
wiped	1
it	0
up	1
it	0
was	0
real	0
easy	1
to	0
clean	0
up	0

oh	0
is	0
that	1
what	0
you	0
usually	0
use	1
in	0
the	0
house	1
is	0
latex	1

yeah	1
and	0
and	1
it	0
it	1
just	0
like	1
the	1

hm	0

the	1
same	1
with	0
the	0
toys	1
it's	0
just	0
important	1
to	0
look	1
for	0
one	0
that	0
doesn't	0
have	0
lead	1
in	0
it	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
says	0
safe	1
for	0
children	1
and	0
all	0
that	1

uh-huh	0
yeah	0
heard	1
about	0
that	1
i	0
guess	0
a	0
friend	1
of	1
mine	0
had	1
a	1
uh	0
um	0
well	0
she	0
she	0
just	1
started	0
up	1
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0
and	1
uh	0
an[d]	0
the	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
real	1
strict	0
uh	0
restrictions	1
was	0
the	0
fact	1
that	0
she	0
had	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
special	1
kind	0
of	0
paint	1
that	0
was	1
fire	1
proof	1
and	1
lead	1
free	1
and	0
all	0
that	0
other	1
good	0
stuff	0

yeah	0

so	0
uh	0
she	1
had	0
that	1
done	0
but	0
uh	0

have	0
you	0
painted	1
anything	0
recently	1

well	1
um	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
i	1
had	0
to	1
paint	1
this	1
uh	0
the	0
inside	1
of	0
this	0
warehouse	1
thing	1
uh	0
that	0
you	0
keep	1
some	0
um	0
farm	1
equipment	0
in	0

wow	1
was	0
it	0
huge	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
um	1
what	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
just	0
coat	1
this	0
bare	1
wood	1
with	0
a	0
sealer	1
and	1
uh	1
i	0
had	0
this	1
big	0
five	1
gallon	0
jug	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
like	1
paint	1
thinner	0
i	1
mean	0
i	1
you	1
know	0
it	1
looked	1
just	1
like	0
it	0
was	1
the	0
viscosity	1
of	0
paint	1
thinner	0

yeah	0

but	1
uh	0
you	0
just	1
took	1
a	0
roller	1
and	0
put	0
it	1
on	1
there	0
and	1
uh	0
if	0
you	1
saw	1
that	1
the	0
wood	1
was	0
getting	0
wet	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
was	0
that	0
was	1
all	0
you	1
needed	1
so	0

wow	1

yeah	1
it	0
was	0
it	0
used	1
all	1
of	0
it	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
about	1
three	1
hundred	1
yards	1
worth	0
so	0
well	1
i	1
guess	1
it	1
worked	1
out	1
it	1
was	0
pretty	1
easy	1
actually	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
though	1
um	0
we're	0
lucky	1
that	0
we	0
didn't	0
have	0
to	0
do	1
any	0
detail	1
work	0
because_1	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
if	0
i	0
could	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0

i	0
don't	0
know	1
must	1
be	0
difficult	1

well	1
what	1
about	1
the	1
trim	1
in	0
your	0
house	1
did	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
do	1
that	1

no	0
it	0
was	0
j[ust]	0
it	0
was	1
really	0
easy	1
i	0
just	1
like	0
what	0
i	0
we	0
had	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
different	1
size	0
brushes	1
and	0
it	0
wa[s]	0
you	1
know	0
real	0
easy	1
i	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
went	0
around	0
the	0
trim	1
and	0
if	0
i[t]	0
and	0
there	0
was	0
wallpaper	1
like	0
i	0
was	0
do[ing]	0
just	0
doing	1
just	0
the	0
trim	1
of	0
the	0
around	0
the	0
doors	0
and	0
windows	1
and	0
there	0
was	0
wallpaper	1
and	0
if	0
we	0
got	0
it	0
on	0
the	0
wallpaper	1
a	0
little	0
bit	1
we	0
just	0
wipe	1
it	0
right	0
away	1
before	0
it	0
dried	1
it	0

um-hum	0

it	0
came	0
right	0
off	1
so	1

oh	0
yeah	0

so	1
there	0
was	0
no	1
major	1
mistakes	0
there	0
was	0

did	0
you	0
have	1
uh	1
one	1
coat	0
or	0
two	1

uh	0
two	1
actually	1

um-hum	0

um	0
and	0
it	0
there	1
was	0
um	1
you	0
know	1
around	0
the	0
windows	1
if	0
you	0
got	0
it	1
on	0
the	0
glass	1
we	1
let	0
it	1
dry	1
and	0
scraped	1
it	0
after	0
that	1
but	0
that	0

yeah	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
really	1
time	1
a	0
a	1
time	1
saver	1

well	1
yeah	1
if	0
you	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
didn't	0
tape	1
anything	0

we	0
weren't	1
that	0
careful	1
but	0
it	0
wasn't	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
it's	0
it's	0
funny	1
it's	0
like	0
if	0
you	1
just	0
go	1
slow	1
you	0
don't	1
get	0
or	0
at	0
least	0
i	1
didn't	1
get	1
that	0
many	1
mistakes	1
i	0

um-hum	0

i	0
didn't	0
make	1
that	0
many	0
mistakes	0

oh	0
me	1
i	1
would've	0
had	1
to	0
have	0
taped	1
the	0
whole	1
thing	1
and	1
then	0
brushed	1
around	0
the	0
edges	1
and	0
and	0
then	1
i'd	0
have	0
probably	0
rolled	1
it	0
on	0
i'd	0
uh	0
it	1
would've	0
taken	1
me	1
forever	1

why	1
just	0
because	0
you'd	0
be	0
afraid	1
to	0
do	0
it	0
or	0
have	0
you	0
done	1
it	0
be[fore]	0

yeah	1
well	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
it'd	1
probably	0
would've	1
tooken	1
me	0
forever	1
so	0

well	1
it	0
wasn't	1
if	0
it	0
was	0
my	0
own	1
i	0
would've	1
but	0
my	0
friend	1
said	0
oh	0
just	0
go	0
ahead	1
you	0
just	0
go	0
ahead	1
it's	0
easy	1
i	0

i	0
said	0
okay	1
it's	0
your	0
place	1

well	0
how	0
long	1
did	0
it	1
take	1
y'all	0

well	1
a	0
couple	1
of	0
weekends	1
we	0
would	0
go	0
down	1
two	0
or	0
three	0
hours	1
on	0
the	0
weekends	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0

so	0
there	0
was	0
two	0
of	0
y'all	1

no	1
there	0
was	0
they	1
were	0
doing	0
all	1
sorts	1
of	0
repairs	0
and	0
there	0
was	0
i	0
was	0
just	0
painting	1
because_1	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
how	0
to	0
do	1
anything	0
else	1
so	0

well	0
that's	1
easy	0
enough	1

so	0
there's	0
a	0
whole	1
bunch	0
of	0
people	0
yeah	1

um	0

so	0
now	1
i	0
feel	0
like	0
if	0
i	0
ever	0
buy	0
a	0
house	1
i	0
can	0
probably	0
paint	1
if	1
nothing	0
else	1

i	1
think	0
i	0
could	0
probably	1
do	0
it	1
uh	0
as	0
long	1
as	0
the	0
hardware	1
store	0
told	1
me	0
what	0
to	0
buy	1
then	1
i	0
could	0
do	0
it	0

yeah	0

but	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
went	0
in	1
to	0
a	0
hardware	1
store	0
to	0
get	0
paint	1
for	0
those	0
toys	1
and	0
the	0
guy	1
said	0
oh	0
get	0
this	1
it's	0
a	0
nice	1
shiny	0
gloss	1
which	0
was	0
true	1

but	1
i	0
didn't	0
realize	0
what	0
you	1
know	0
a	0
pain	1
it	0
is	0
to	0
clean	0
the	0
brushes	1
and	0
everything	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
latex	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
worth	1
the	0
shi[ne]	0

um-hum	0

right	1
okay	1

yes	1

okay	1
how	1
many	1
kids	1
do	1
you	1
have	1

i	1
think	1
w[e]	0
i	0
think	1
we're	1
going	1
to	0
talk	1
about	1
parents	1
spending	1
time	1
with	1
their	1
children	1
we	1
have	1
three	1
children	1
who	1
are	1
eleven	1
nine	1
and	0
eight	1

right	1

so	1
this	1
is	0
a	1
big	0
issue	1
with	1
us	1
although	1
i	0
don't	1
recall	1
marking	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
little	1
things	1
to	1
talk	1
about	0
but	1
perhaps	1
they	1
are	0
looking	1
for	1
uh	1
words	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
like	1
day	1
care	1
and	1
quality	1
time	1
and	1

and	1

uh-huh	0

anyway	1
you	1
don't	0
have	0
children	1

no	1

but	0
you're	0
married	1

yeah	0
w[e]	0
we	1
been	0
married	0
for	0
two	0
and	0
a	0
half	0
years	0
we've	1
been	0
trying	1
for	0
about	0
two	1
years	0
but	0
no	0
luck	0
yet	1

oh	0

hopefully	1

you	1
know	1
i	1
know	1
we're	0
not	1
supposed	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
long	1
distance	1
but	1
actually	1
i'm	1
getting	0
a	0
call	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
i	0
could	1
possibly	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
call	1
waiting	1
could	1
i	0
ask	1
you	1
to	1
hold	1
one	1
minute	1

uh-huh	1

i'll	1
be	1
right	1
back	0
excuse	1
me	1
just	1
a	0
moment	1
they're	1

had	1

they're	1
gonna	1
get	1
mad	1

she	0
has	0
three	1
kids	0
eleven	1
nine	1
and	0
eight	1

hello	1

uh-huh	1

i'm	1
so	1
sorry	1

was	1
my	1
daughter's	1
brownie	1
leader	1
telling	1
me	0
that	1
there	0
is	1
a	1
meeting	1
tomorrow	0

have	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
activities	1
with	0

kids	0

well	1
i	1
don't	1
wanna	1
i	1
don't	1
want	0
this	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
unilateral	1
conversation	1
but	1
yes	1
we	1
do	1
both	1

both	1
my	1
husband	1
and	0
i	1

that's	1
exactly	1
what	0
it	0
was	0
but	0

well	1
i	1

think	0
with	1
working	1
parents	1
it	0
is	1
i	1
mean	1
there	1
are	1
some	0
real	0
issues	1
here	1
um	1
that	0
i	1
think	1
um	0

uh-huh	0

i	1
don't	1
know	0
it's	0
an	1
interesting	1
phenomena	1
i	0
happen	1
to	0
um	0
i'm	0
a	0
pediatrician	1

oh	0

my	0
husband	1
is	0
a	0
physician	1
so	0
um	0
i	0
i	1
teasingly	1
i	0
talk	0
to	0
parents	0
about	0
this	0
a	0
lot	1
uh	0
children	1
i	0
i	0
think	1
working	1
mothers	0
or	0
mothers	1
who	0
choose	1
to	0
work	0
outside	1
the	1
home	1
um	0
need	1
very	1
early	1
to	1
come	1
to	0
grips	1
with	1
any	0
guilt	1
that	0
they	0
feel	1
and	0
decide	1
what's	0
best	1
for	0
them	1
and	0
their	0
family	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	1
feel	0
when	0
my	0
children	0
were	1
very	1
young	1
i	0
had	1
jobs	1
that	1
helped	1
me	0
be	1
flexible	1
with	0
my	0
schedule	0
and	1
spend	0
time	1
with	1
them	0
and	1
all	1
that	1
sort	0
of	1
thing	1
and	0
i	1
long	1
ago	1
decided	0
i'm	0
a	0
better	0
mother	1
because	0
i	0
work	0
outside	0
the	0
home	1
i	0

um-hum	0

i	0
really	1
believe	1
that	0
and	0
it	0
has	0
um	0
helped	1
us	0
to	0
afford	1
some	0
things	1
for	0
our	0
children	0
that	0
we	0
couldn't	0
otherwise	1
that	0
i	0
think	0
are	0
wonderful	1
particularly	0
at	0
this	0
age	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
our	0
kids	0
are	0
real	1
secure	1
and	1
have	0
a	0
real	1
sense	1
of	0
priorities	1
and	0
that	0
they	0
can	0
do	0
anything	1
and	0
be	0
anything	1
both	0
male	1
and	0
female	0
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

so	0
i	1
know	1
it	1
sounds	1
like	0
a	0
rationalization	1
but	1
it's	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
it's	0
true	1
for	0
our	1
family	0
and	0

well	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
has	0
worked	1
very	0
well	1

yeah	0
it's	0
like	0
you	0
said	0
it's	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
each	1
his	0
own	1
i	0
mean	1
we're	0
planning	0
on	0
having	0
my	1
wife	0
stay	0
home	0
and	0
but	0

there's	1
no	0
question	1
i	0
think	0
that's	0
really	1
the	0
best	1
if	0
if	0
a	0
woman	1
is	0
happy	0
doing	0
that	0

um-hum	0

i	0
hate	1
to	0
put	0
it	0
quite	1
that	0
way	1

yeah	0

i	0
was	0
twenty	1
nine	0
when	0
i	0
had	0
my	0
first	1
child	0
and	0
um	0
i	1
would	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
real	1
fulfilled	1
i	0
really	1
would	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
totally	1
staying	0
home	1
with	0
a	0
young	0
child	1
it's	0

um-hum	0

it's	0
a	0
wonderful	1
it's	0
wonderful	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
mother	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
liked	0
i	0
like	0
the	0
way	1
i	0
did	0
it	0

right	1

i	1
sort	0
of	0
worked	0
half	1
time	0
i	0
had	0
very	1
flexible	0
hours	1
i	0
nursed	0
all	1
three	0
of	0
our	0
children	0
till	0
they	0
were	0
at	0
least	1
a	0
year	1
and	0
i	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
that	0
despite	1
working	0
very	1
easily	0
which	0
is	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
i	0
preach	1
all	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
to	0
mothers	1

oh	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
we	0
choose	1
very	1
very	0
carefully	1
the	0
um	0
alternative	0
situations	1
that	0
we	0
had	1
them	0
in	0

um-hum	0

some	0
babysitting	1
groups	0
again	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
rationalization	1
but	0
i	0
really	0
do	1
think	0
sometimes	0
they	0
very	1
early	0
on	0
are	0
around	0
lots	1
of	0
other	0
children	0
and	0
they	0
they	0
learn	1
to	0
share	1
and	0
they	0
learn	1
not	0
necessarily	1
to	0
be	0
the	0
center	0
of	0
attention	1
but	0
that	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	0
we	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
sure	1
they're	0
secure	1

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
that	0
helps	1

well	0
that's	0
good	1
sounds	0
like	0
you're	0
have	0
a	0
handle	1
on	0
it	0

oh	0
yeah	0
hope	0
so	1
so	0
your	0
wife	1
does	0
she	0
work	1
right	0
now	1

um	0
no	1
not	0
right	0
now	1
right	0

she's	0
out	0

right	0
right	0
well	0
we	1
just	0
moved	1
down	0
here	0
we	1
used	0
to	0
live	0
up	0
in	0
seattle	1
f[or]	0
for	0
a	0
couple	1
years	0

you're	0
still	0
trying	1
to	0
dry	0
out	1

it's	0
it's	0
no	0
problem	1
here	1
yeah	0
we	1
really	0
liked	1
it	0
up	0
there	0
but	0
then	1
when	0

you	1
wanna	1
go	1
first	1

no	1
you	1
can	1
start	1

okay	1
um	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
they	1
talked	1
about	1
was	1
uh	1
did	1
we	1
di[d]	1
wha[t]	1
do	1
what	1
do	0
we	1
think	1
about	1
a	0
judge	1
making	1
the	1
decision	1

um-hum	1

and	1
i	1
really	1
don't	1
agree	1
with	1
that	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
is	0
better	1
uh	1
you	1
know	1
than	1
e[ven]	1
having	1
a	1
unanimous	1
decision	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
one	1
person	1
be	0
responsible	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
that	1
they	0
could	1
be	1
objective	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
every	1
time	1

right	1

y[ou]	0
you	0
know	1
what	0
i	0
mean	1

right	1
there's	1
there	1
th[is]	1
thi[s]	1
this	1
topic	1
is	1
kind	0
of	0
moot	1
um	1
there	1

yeah	1

there	1
there's	0
no	0
way	1
we	1
we	1
couldn't	0
survive	1
in	1
a	1
sy[stem]	0
in	1
a	1
in	1
a	1
juror	1
syst[em]	0
in	1
a	1
trial	1
system	1
without	1
a	1
jury	1

right	1

um	1
one	1
man	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
one	0
man	1
one	0
woman	1
can	0
never	1
be	0
objectionable	1
in	1
every	1
case	1

that's	0
it	1

um	1
every	1
person	1
has	1
their	1
opinions	1
and	1
that's	1
why	1
jury	1
selection	0
is	1
often	1
very	1
difficult	1
um	1

well	0
i	1
i	0
feel	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
too	1
uh	0
they	1
were	0
saying	1
uh	1
you	1
know	0
what	1
new	1
ways	1
could	1
you	1
could	1
it	1
you	1
you	1
know	0
change	1
the	0
system	1
i	1
i	0
really	1
think	1
that	1
um	1
we	1
spend	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
time	1
uh	1
going	1
through	1
appeal	1
after	1
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
i	0

i	0
mean	0
i[f]	1
if	0
you	1
go	1
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
and	0
especially	1
if	0
a	0
person	1
has	1
confessed	1
if	0
they	1
have	1
been	1
caught	1
you	1
know	1
point	1
blank	1
in	1
the	0
crime	1
there's	1
uh	1
no	1
question	1
it's	1

right	1

it's	1
beyond	1
a	1
reasonable	1
doubt	1
you	0
all	1
these	0
things	1
i	1
mean	0
you	1
know	1
we've	1
gone	1
through	0
this	1
uh	0
over	1
and	0
over	1
again	0

right	1
they	0
shouldn't	0
allow	1
an	0
appeal	1

and	1
it	1
can	0
go	1
on	1
for	1
ten	1
twenty	1
years	0

yep	1

i	1
i	1
think	1
this	0
is	0
a	1
little	1
ridiculous	1

um-hum	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
only	1
people	1
who	1
benefit	1
from	1
that	0
are	0
the	0
lawyers	1

no	1
that's	0
right	1
i	0
work	1
for	0
a	1
law	1
firm	1
i	1
ought	0

i	1
i'm	0
serious	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
lawyers	1
have	0
caused	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	1
problems	1
tha[t]	1
ha[ppen]	0
that	1
exist	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
criminal	1
system	0
today	1
with	0
plea	1
bargaining	1

right	1

you	1
know	0
if	1
someone	1
is	1

well	1
plea	1
bar[gaining]	1
plea	1
bargaining	1
is	0
a	0
different	0
story	1

well	1

plea	1
bargaining	1
is	0
something	0
completely	0
different	1
that	1
that	1
actually	0
prevents	1
trials	0
or	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
speeds	1
them_1	0
up	1

well	1
i	0
know	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	1
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
all	1
of	0
the	0
whole	0
criminal	1
system	1
is	0
messed	1
up	1
in	0
in	0
that	1
regard	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
know	1
people	1
who	0
commit	1
uh	0
crimes	1
that	0
they	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	1
it	0
works	1
exactly	1
but	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	0
lesser	1
sentences	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
understand	0
that	0
the	0
jails	1
are	0
full	0
of	0
people	1
you	0
know	1
uh	1
and	0
that	0
they	1
have	1
to	0
do	1
something	1

right	1

but	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
reason	1
they	0
are	1
full	0
is	0
because	1
they	0
know	1
that	0
they	1
can	0
get	0
away	1
with	0
it	0

hum	1

you	0
you	1
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
tha[t]	0
we	0
we	1
don't	0
have	1
um	1
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
states	0
don't	1
have	0
capital	0
punishment	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
i	1
think	1
they	1
should	1

we	1
do	0

i	0
and	0
i	1
think	0
if	0
a	1
person	1
is	0
guilty	1
of	0
taking	1
someone's	0
life	1
and	0
like	0
you	0
say	1
it's	0
it's	0
there's	0
no	1
doubt	1
whatsoever	0
like	0
drunk	0
drivers	1
that	0
kill	1
people	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
all	1

right	1

they	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	1
i	0
i	1
just	0
think	1
that	0
that's	1
they've	0
they've	1
taken	1
a	0
life	1
and	0
if	1
they	1
should	0
pay	1
for	0
it	0
with	0
their	1
life	1

right	1
when	1
you're	0
saying	1
as	0
as	0
far	1
as	1
the	0
appeal	1
um	1
procedure	1
is	0
concerned	1

yeah	1

we	1
just	0
have	0
the	0
case	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
you've	0
probably	0
heard	1
of	0
marion	1
berry	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
his	1
fi[nal]	0
his	0
last	1
appeal	1
was	1
was	0
denied	1
two	1
days	0
before	0
his	0
sentence	1
was	0
up	1

oh	0
really	1

so	1
i	1
mean	1
his	0
appeal	1
was	1
denied	1
and	0
two	1
days	1
later	0
he	1
got	0
out	0
of	1
jail	1
for	1
cocaine	1
possession	1

it	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
um	1
that	1
was	1
absurd	1
there	0
was	1
no	0
there	1
was	0
no	1
reason	0
the	1
appeal	1
process	0
should	0
have	1
dragged	1
on	0
that	0
long	1
for	1
a	0
six	1
month	0
sentence	1

i	1
know	0
that	1
the	0

uh-huh	1
an[d]	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
wha[t]	0
what	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
to	1
change	1
it	1
to	0
make	1
it	0
better	1

well	1
uh	0
the	1
the	0
only	1
thing	1
i	0
can	1
i	1
was	1
you	0
know	0
the	1
the	1
appeal	1
procedure	1
is	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	1
can	0
possibly	0
think	1
of	0
um	1
i	0
like	1
i	0
said	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
removing	1
of	0
the	0
jury	1
and	0
having	1
the	0
judge	1
sentence	0
that's	1
absurd	1
there's	1
no	0
way	1
that	1
could	0
work	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
don't	0
agree	1
with	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	1
but	1

imagine	1
the	0
guilt	1
that	1
person	1
would	0
have	1
i	0
mean	1
it	1
burned	1
out	1

oh	1
exactly	1

is	1
there's	1
no	1
possible	1
way	1
that	0
you	1
could	1
um	0
you	1
know	1
feel	0
good	1
about	1
yourself	1

exactly	1

right	1

if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
do	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
day	1
after	0
day	1

no	1
one	0
would	0
want	1
the	1
job	1

no	1
rea[lly]	1
not	1
really	1

any	1
reason	1
to	1
use	1
this	1

or	1
this	1
brain	1
that	1

for	0
anything	1

but	0
uh	0
a	0
really	1
good	0
day	1
care	0
is	0
probably	0
going	0
to	0
cost	1
more	0
than	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
make	0
at	0
the	0
job	1

and	0
and	0
uh	0
we'll	0
see	0
how	1
the	0
generations	0
go	1
huh	0

yeah	1
i	0
at	1
least	1
for	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	1
depending	1
on	1
on	0
what	0
she	1
did	1
i've	1

yeah	1

i've	1
i	1
was	0
an	1
engineer	1
with	0
uh	0
mechanical	1
engineer	0
with	0
t	0
i	1
and	1
uh	0
i	1
did	0
it	0
for	0
six	1
years	1
and	1
for	0
one	1
well	0
i	0
had	1
one	1
while	0
i	0
was	0
pregnant	1
and	0
then	0
one	1
while	0
my	1
oldest	1
was	0
a	0
year	1
old	1
and	0
and	1
it	0
just	0
drove	1
me	0
crazy	1

did	1
you	1

i	1
could	0
not	0
do	1
either	1
well	1
enou[gh]	0
i	1
couldn't	0
put	0
in	0
enough	1
overtime	0
that	0
was	0
necess[ary]	1
or	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
things	1
that	0
would	0
come	1
up	0
at	0
work	1
that	0
would	1
require	1
me	0
to	0
stay	0
late	1
or	1
to	1
come	0
in	0
early	1
or	0
to	0
do	0
something	0
on	0
saturdays	1
as	1
is	0
you	1
know	0
as	1
is	1
needed	1
and	1
because	1
my	0
husband	1
had	0
had	0
for	1
a	0
long	1
time	1
was	1
out	1
of	0
the	0
country	1
also	1
with	0
uh	0
with	0
work	1
for	0
like	0
three	1
months	0
and	0

um-hum	0

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
and	0

so	0
it	0
was	0
you	1
and	0
the	0
kid	1
and	0
your	0
work	1
schedule	1
is	0

yeah	1

well	0
that's	1
the	0
thing	0
see	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	1
if	0
you	0
get	0
along	0
for	0
example	0
if	0
you'd	1
been	0
a	0
technician	1
instead	1
of	1
an	0
engineer	1
you	0
know	0
the	1
technicians	1
work	0
the	1
eight	0
to	1
five	1
job	1
and	1
and	0
know	1
when	1
they're	0
going	1
to	0
be	1
there	0

yeah	1
it	0
might	1
have	1
been	1
better	1

yeah	1

but	1
uh	0
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
pro[fessional]	1
professional	1
oriented	1
then	0
you've	0
got	1
to	1
have	0
this	1
to	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
perform	1
well	0
on	1
the	0
job	1
you've	0
got	1
to	1
have	0
the	1
flexibility	1
that	1
that	0
doesn't	1
really	0
go	1
with	0
the	0
family	1

yeah	1
and	0
so	0
it	1
was	0
in	0
my	1
case	1
i	1
i	0
just	0
uh	0
decided	1
that	0
as	0
long	1
as	1
my	0
kids	1
were	0
little	1
i	1
would	0
be	0
better	0
off	1
at	0
home	0
with	0
them	1
instead	0
of	1
driving	1
myself	0
crazy	1
trying	0
to	0
do	1
everything	1
at	0
once	1

um-hum	0
so	1
you	0
figure	1
one	1
of	0
these	1
days	1

well	1
actually	0
i've	1
found	0
out	0
that	0
i'm	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
go	0
back	0
to	0
being	0
an	0
engineer	1

you're	0
going	1
to	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
being	1
an	0
engineer	1
is	1
that	1
what	0
you	0
think	1

i'm	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
a	0
photographer	1
now	0

oh	1
okay	1
you've	0
found	1
something	0
else	1

i	0
have	1
i	0
have	0
branched	1
out	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
photographer	1
before	1
but	0
when	0
i	1
went	0
to	0
college	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
felt	0
like	0
i	1
couldn't	0
support	0
myself	1
if	0
i	0
decided	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
photographer	1
that	0
it	1
would	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
hobby	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
i'm	1
i'm	1
very	0
mechanical	1
and	0
mechanical	0
engineering	1
interested	0
me	1
so	0
i	0
did	0
that	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
did	1
that	0
for	0
six	1
years	0
and	1
then	0
i	1
stayed	0
home	1
with	1
my	0
son	1
and	0
did	0
nothing	1
and	0
found	1
out	0
that	0
i	0
was	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
great	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
i	1
was	0
bored	1
part	1
of	0
the	0
time	1
too	1
and	0
i	0
wanted	0
something	1
else	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	0
i	1
mean	0
you	0
figure	1
there's	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
more	0
to	1
life	1
than	0
sitting	1
here	0
playing	1
with	0
this	1
child	1

yeah	0
and	0
it['s]	1
it's	1
great	1
while	1
they're	0
really	0
little	1
but	0
as	1
they	0
get	0
older	1
and	1
they're	1
more	1
independent	1
and	1
there's	1
things	1
to	1
do	1
then	1
it's	1
good	1
for	0
them	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
different	1

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	1
it	1
he	0
goes	1
to	0
a	1
a	0
mother's	1
day	0
out	1
program	1
now	0
once	0
a	1
week	1
both	1
of	0
my	0
kids	1
do	1
and	1
so	0
they're	1
getting	1
they	1
they	1
get	0
the	1
socialization	1
with	0
other	0
kids	1
and	0
y[ou]	0
you	1
know	0
and	0
not	1
really	0
school	1
but	1
but	1
a	0
different	1
authority	0
than	0
mom	1
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
kind	0
of	0
learning	0
how	1
to	0
deal	0
with	0
society	1

and	1
and	0
they	1
they	0
need	1
that	1
you	0
know	0
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	1
relate	1
to	0
other	0
people	0
besides	1
the	0
same	1
person	1
every	1
day	1

yeah	1
i	1
think	1
they	0
do	1
too	0

and	0
i	1
need	1
it	0
for	0
the	0
break	1

yeah	1
well	0
that's	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
you	0
know	0
they	0
talk	0
about	0
women	1
leaving	1
the	0
home	1
and	0
going	0
out	0
to	0
work	1
well	1
still	1
taking	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
children	1
is	1
a	0
very	1
important	1
job	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1
and	0
someone's	1
got	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
and	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
do	0
it	0
right	1
and	1
and	1
if	0
it's	0
not	1
if	1
it's	0
not	0
mom	1
then	1
then	0
dad	1
or	1
somebody's	1
got	0
to	1
move	1
in	0
there	1
and	0
do	1
the	0
job	1
because	1
the	1
kids	1
really	0
need	1
it	0

and	0
enjoy	1
it	0
that's	1
that's	1
the	0
whole	1
thing	0

yeah	1

i	1
think	0
that's	1
the	0
thing	1
that	1
were	0
going	0
to	0
see	1
well	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
biggest	1
thing	0
we're	0
going	0
to	1
see	1
coming	1
up	1
in	0
the	1
next	1
ten	1
year[s]	0
even	1
in	0
the	0
even	1
now	1
they're	0
starting	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
going	1
to	1
be	0
more	1
in	1
the	0
next	1
ten	1
to	0
fifteen	0
years	1
is	0
that	1
there's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	1

different	0
directions	1
i	1

it	0
was	0
just	0
driving	0

crazy	1
and	0
now	1
with	0
the	0
photography	1
that's	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
working	1
that's	0
what	0
i'm	0
doing	1
is	0
working	0
part	1
time	1
because	0
i	0
can	0
put	1
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
situation	1
for	1
a	0
few	0
hours	1
in	0
the	0
uh	0
week	1
and	0
and	1
use	1
those	0
hours	1
to	0
do	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
thing	1
that	0
i'm	0
doing	0
is	1
taking	1
school	0
pictures	1
in	1
day	1
cares	1
and	0
in	1
mother's	0
day	0
out	1
programs	1

an[d]	1
when	1
he's	0
at	0
home	1
can	0
take	1
care	1
of	0
them	0

yeah	0
so	0
jobs	1
have	0
to	0
i	0
guess	0
become	1
more	0
flexible	1

i	0
think	1
they're	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
and	0
not	1
and	0
not	0
just	0
for	0
mothers	1
for	0
fathers	1
as	0
well	1

yeah	1

it's	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
both	1

well	0
so	0
so	1
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
that	0
has	0
to	0
adapt	1
is	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
the	1
the	0
father's	1
attitudes	1
about	0
you	0
know	0
who[se]	1
whose	1
job	1
is	1
this	0

yeah	1

well	1
it['s]	0
it's	0
his	1
job	0
too	0
and	0
i	1
to	0
me	1
the	0
only	0
important	1
issue	1
is	0
the	0
children	1
because	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
housework	1
goes	1
you	0
know	1
men	1
can	0
do	0
housework	1
just	0
as	0
easily	1
as	0
women	1
and	0
thanks	1
to	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
new	0
inventions	1
housework	1
doesn't	0
take	0
as	1
much	1
time	1
as	0
it	0
used	1
to	0
so	1
uh	0

it's	0
just	0
convincing	1
your	0
husband	1
that's	1
important	1
or	0
that	1
that	1
that	0
it's	1
important	1
enough	0
for	1
him	0
to	1
do	1
it	0

yeah	1
to	0
yeah	1
to	0
m[e]	0

yeah	1
well	1

because	1
if	0
he	0
saw	1
mom	1
doing	1
only	1
that	1
you	0
know	0
all	1
the	0
time	0
he	1
was	0
growing	0
up	1
then	0
it's	0
hard	1
to	0
think	0
of	0
it	1
in	0
that	0
other	1
you	0
know	0
uh	1
that	0
i	1
should	0
do	1
it	0
or	0
tha[t]	1
or	0
just	0
to	0
think	1
about	1
doing	1
it	0
rather	1
than	0
having	1
someone	1
tell	1
him	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

and	0
you	1
you	0
you	1

yeah	1
you	0
talk	1
yeah	1

yeah	1

i	0
know	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
big	0
thing	1
in	0
our	0
house	1
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
was	0
that	1
if	0
i	0
wanted	1
my	0
husband	0
to	0
do	0
something	1
to	0
help	1
and	0
even	0
though	1
we	0
were	0
both	1
working	0
the	0
same	1
number	0
of	0
hours	1
and	0
and	0
doing	0
things	0
i	1
had	0
to	0
come	0
in	0
there	0
specifically	1
and	0
say	1
this	1
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
this	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

this	0
is	0
what	1
you	0
do	1
it	0
now	1
no	1

and	0
a	0
man	1
might	0
say	1
out	0
loud	1
well	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
understand	1
this	1
and	0
i	0
agree	1
but	0
still	1
he	0
was	0
raised	1
with	0
a	0
mom	1
taking	0
care	1
of	0
him	0
and	0

yes	1
and	1

and	0
and	0
that's	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
attitude	0
to	0
change	1

yeah	0
and	1
without	1
and	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
they	0
don't	0
look	1
at	0
things	1
most	1
men	0
don't	0
walk	1
into	0
the	0
kitchen	1
and	0
see	0
that	0
the	0
dishes	1
are	0
there	1
and	0
that	0
yes	1
you	0
probably	0
ought	0
to	0
unload	1
the	0
dishwasher	1
and	0
load	1
the	0
new	0
ones	0
in	1
and	0
run	1
it	0

um-hum	0

they	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
kind	0
of	0
scoot	1
it	0
on	0
another	0
spot	1
on	1
the	0
on	0
the	0
sink	1
and	1
and	0
put	0
the	0
next	0
plate	1
down	1
and	1
and	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
get	0
around	1
to	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
most	0
women	0
walk	1
in	0
and	0
and	0
and	1
with	0
oh	0
got	0
to	0
clean	1
all	0
this	0
up	1
got	0
to	0
get	1
this	1
out	1
and	0
this	0
in	1
and	0
this	1
you	1
know	0
taken	0
care	1
of	0
instead	1
of	0
having	0
someone	0
say	1
now	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
do[ne]	1
this	1
is	0
the	0
time	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
but	0

hm	0
uh	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1

and	0

but	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
is	0
is	1
how	1
it	0
was	0
drilled	1
into	0
you	0
when	0
you	0
were	0
a	0
kid	1
which	0
brings	0
us	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
idea	1
you	0
know	0
someone's	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
there	0
taking	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
kids	1
to	0
drill	1
in	0
these	1
you	0
know	0
drill	1
in	0
the	0
right	1
ideas	0
to	0
so	0
that	0
they	0
know	1
that	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
male	1
and	0
female	1
are	0
both	0
responsible	0
for	0
doing	1
this	0
and	0

that's	0
right	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

and	0
and	1
uh	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	1
going	0
to	0
show	1
up	0
a	0
lot	1
more	1
now	0
in	0
the	1
in	1
the	0
next	0
generation	0
of	1
of	0
boys	1
and	0
girls	1
it's	0
not	1
they're	1
not	0
going	1
to	0
the	0
boys	1
in	0
this	0
next	1
generation	0
are	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
told	1
as	0
much	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
because	0
mom	1
was	0
there	1
saying	0
that	0
dad	1
is	0
there	1
you	0
know	0
you	0

uh-huh	0


you	0
both	1
got	1
to	0
they	1
were	0
both	1
working	0
at	0
whatever	0
things	1
were	0
needed	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
they're	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

they're	1
going	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
the	0
kids	1
you	1
need	0
do	0
this	1
because	1
it	0
needs	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
not	0
because	1
it's	0
a	0
woman's	1
job	1
or	0
a	0
man's	1
job	0
but	0
because	1
it's	0
dirty	1
and	0
it	0
needs	1
to	0
be	0
cleaned	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
in	0
between	1
we	0
got	1
a	0
a	0
group	1
of	0
kids	0
a	0
generation	1
of	0
kids	0
who	1
didn't	1
learn	0
to	0
take	0
responsibility	1
because	1
mom	1
left	0
to	0
go	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
and	0
dad	1
didn't	0
move	1
in	0
to	0
fill	0
the	0
gap	1
and	0
so	0
basically	1
no	1
one	0
was	0
taking	0
the	0
responsibility	1

and	0
it's	0
gonna	1
it's	0
gonna	1
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
happened	1
in	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
cases	1

yeah	1
some	0
kids	0
are	0
really	1
having	0
it	0
if	0
they'd	0
been	1
in	0
day	0
care	0
the	0
entire	1
time	1
and	0
it	0
wasn't	1
yeah	1
the	0
ones	1
that	0
are	0
now	0
getting	1
to	0
be	0
teenagers	1
and	0
in	0
some	0
cases	1
young	0
college	1

um-hum	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
some	1
time	0
day	1
care	0
is	0
really	0
good	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
sometimes	1
it's	0
just	1
it's	0
baby	1
sitting	0

yeah	1

it's	0
someone	1
you	0
know	0
keeping	0
an	0
eye	1
on	0
the	0
kids	1
but	0
the	0
kids	0
are	0
basically	1
doing	0
what	0
they	0
want	1
and	0
not	1
really	1
having	0
any	1
relationship	1
with	0
the	0
adults	1
to	0
say	0
you	0
know	0
here's	1
what's	0
right	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
here's	1
what's	0
wrong	1
and	0
and	0
here's	1
what	0
we	0
expect	1
of	0
you	0

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
that	1
was	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
main	0
reasons	1
that	0
i	0
quit	1
was	0
because	0
i	0
wanted	1
my	1
kids	0
to	0
have	0
my	1
values	0
and	0
i	0
felt	1
like	0
when	0
they	0
were	0
young	1
that	0
was	1
the	0
time	1
to	0
instill	1
it	0
that	0
it	1
could	0
be	1
it	0
could	0
be	0
added	1
to	0
and	0
strengthened	1
as	0
they	0
grew	0
older	1
but	0
when	1
they	0
were	0
little	1
you	0
know	0
this	1

yeah	1

this	1
is	0
the	0
way	0
i	1
feel	0
about	1
this	0
and	0
this	1
is	0
the	0
way	1
because_1	1
i	0
it's	0
you	1
know	0
when	1
you	0
when	0
you	0
if	0
you	1
if	0
you	0
teach	1
them	0
when	0
they're	0
little	1
the	0
way	1
you	0
want	1
them	0
to	0
be	1
and	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
are	0
important	0
to	0
you	1
then	0
you	0
just	1
you	0
add	1
onto	0
it	0
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

um-hum	0

but	0
if	0
no	1
one	0
does	0
anything	1
when	0
they're	0
little	1
then	0
it's	0
twice	1
as	0
hard	1
as	0
i	0
think	1
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

yeah	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
saying	1
this	0
as	0
i'm	0
trying	1
to	0
keep	0
my	0
nine	0
month	0
old	1
from	0
trashing	1
something	0

yes	1
i	0
understand	1
i	1
i	0
wait	1
until	0
i	0
put	0
mine	0
in	0
bed	1
before	0
i	0
make	0
my	0
calls	1

yeah	0
well	0
she's	1
usually	1
in	0
bed	0
by	0
this	0
time	0
but	0
she's	0
staying	1
up	0
late	1
tonight	0
but	0
yeah	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
relationship	0
with	0
her	1
you	0
know	0
m[y]	1
my	1
dad	0
was	0
a	0
very	0
traditional	0
dad	1
and	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
child	1
i	1
didn't	0
really	0
know	1
my	0
dad	0
very	0
well	0
and	0
i	0
miss	1
that	0
and	0
i	1
want	1

that's	1
the	0
thing	1
if	0
woman's	0
role	1
like	0
we	0
said	0
if	0
women's	1
roles	1
change	0
drastically	1
men's	1
roles	0
will	0
too	1

yeah	0
the	0
men	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
convinced	1
of	0
that	1

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it's	0
for	0
the	0
better	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
women's	1
roles	0
i	0
think	0
are	0
almost	1
for	0
the	0
worse	1
because	0
we're	1
losing	1
out	0
on	0
some	0
things	1
going	0
back	0
to	0
work	1
but	1
i	0
think	1
if	0
we	0
can	1
if	0
we	0
can	0
expand	1
the	0
men's	0
roles	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	1
like	0
your	1
taking	0
care	0
of	0
your	0
child	1
and	0
your	0
dad	1
probably	0
didn't	0
very	1
often	0
i	0

no	1

i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
mine	1
almost	0
never	1
did	0

what	1
kind	1
of	1
car	1
do	1
you	1
drive	1
now	1

i	1
drive	1
a	1
honda	1
prelude	1
and	1

do	1
you	1
i	1
drive	1
a	1
honda	1
accord	1

oh	1
yeah	1

yeah	1

i	1
bought	1
mine	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
so	1
i'm	1
not	1
buying	1

the	1

good	1
spots	1
and	0

right	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
have	1
an	0
automatic	1
i	1
can't	1
drive	1

standard	1

oh	1
really	1
i	1

yeah	1

i	1
have	1
a	0
standard	1

but	1
um	0
i	1
it's	1
and	1
it's	1
supposedly	1
real	1
reliable	1
the	0
only	1
thing	1
i've	0
ever	0
heard	1
about	1
hondas	1
is	0
that	1
the	1
breaks	1

i	0
had	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
had	1
little	1
piddly	1
things	1
like	1
i	0
had	0
to	0
replace	1
the	0
muffler	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
had	0
replaced	1
the	1
tires	1
and	1
uh	0
seems	1
like	0
it	0
had	1
a	0
radiator	1
leak	0
once	1
but	0
i	0
never	1
had	0
any	1
major	1
anything	1
other	1
than	1
the	0
compressor	1

right	0

i	1
never	1
really	0
had	0
anything	1
major	1
with	0
my	0
mazda	1
but	1
it	0
was	1
a	0
standard	1
also	1
and	0
the	0
clutch	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
it	1
toward	1
the	0
end	1
i	0
had	0
it	0
five	1
years	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
year	1
or	0
last	1
two	1
years	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
go	0
out	1
really	1
easily	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
went	0
out	0
twice	1
in	0
two	0
years	1
and	0
that's	1
that's	1
a	0
lot	1
it	0
shouldn't	1
go	0
out	1
that	1
much	1

no	1
hm	0

and	1
so	1
i	0
went	1
ahead	1
and	0
bought	0
another	1
standard	1
when	1
i	1
bought	1
the	1
honda	1
but	0
i	0
don't	1
think	0
i'm	1
going	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
again	1
i	1
think	0
i'm	1
going	1
back	1
to	0
automatic	1
now	1

well	1
i	1
never	1
w[ell]	1
well	0
i	0
kind	1
of	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
standard	1
but	1
i've	0
never	1
owned	0
one	1
so	0
i	0
had[n't]	1
i	0
don't	0
drive	1
one	0
a	0
lot	1

right	1

so	1
i	0
don't	1
f[eel]	0
feel	0
comfortable	1
in	0
traffic	1
with	0
it	1

right	1

and	1
for	0
everything	1
i've	0
heard	1
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
easier	0
to	0
sell	1
an	0
automatic	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1

and	1
and	0
resale	1
value	1
is	0
really	1
important	0
to	0
me	1

that's	0
true	1

yeah	1
it	0
is	1
me	0
too	1
that's	0
why	1
i	0
got	1
the	0
honda	1

yeah	0

hondas	1
have	1
great	1
resale	1
value	0

yeah	0

the	0
mazda	1
definitely	1
did	0
not	1
not	1
at	0
all	1
they're	1
worse	1
than	0
american	1
cars	0
i	1
think	1
or	0
just	1
as	0
bad	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
resale	1
goes	1

i	1
did	0
pretty	0
well	1
with	0
my	1
uh	1
regal	1
because	0
it	1
was	1
in	0
really	1
good	1
shape	1
but	1
it	1
still	1
looked	1
real	1
nice	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	1
interior	1
was	1
still	1
really	1
nice	1
there	0
[what'n/wasn't]	1
cracks	1
all	0
over	0
the	0
dash	1
board	0
and	0
stuff	1
an[d]	1

right	1

and	0
it	0
had	1
some	1
some	1
nice	0
features	1
so	0
i	1
ended	0
up	0
okay	1
with	0
the	0
buick	1

good	1

and	0
i	0
anticipate	1
the	0
same	0
thing	1
with	1
the	0
honda	1
whenever	0
i	0
decide	1
to	1
sell	1
it	0
course	1
i	0
may	1
never	1
sell	1
it	0

right	1

i	0
may	0
drive	1
it	0
till	0
it's	0
dead	1
but	1

yeah	1
that's	1
what	0
i	0
did	1
with	1
the	0
mazda	1
drive	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
till	1
the	0
clutch	1
went	1
out	1
and	0
the	0
wheels	1
fell	0
off	1
so	1

yeah	0

so	1
probably	1
what	1
i'll	0
do	0
again	1

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
really	1
like	1
the	0
hondas	1
i	1
like	0
foreign	1
cars	1
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	1

yeah	0

i	1
looked	1
at	0
the	0
mitsubishi	1
galant	1
i	1
was	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
four	1
door	0
car	1
having	0
driven	1
the	0
rx	1
seven	0
so	0
long	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
so	1
small	1
and	0
it's	0
really	1
impractical	1
so	0
i	0
wanted	1
something	0
with	0
a	0
real	1
trunk	1
and	0
four	1
doors	1
something	0
easy	1
to	0
get	0
in	0
and	0
out	1
of	0
and	0
i	0
looked	1
at	0
the	0
galant	1
and	1
those	1
were	1
really	1
nice	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
them_1	1
for	0
a	0
great	1
price	1

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
found	1
it	1
hard	1
to	0
deal	1
with	1
the	1
dealership	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
through	1

oh	1

so	1
that's	1
how	1
i	1
ended	1
up	0
with	1
a	1
honda	1

i	0
wasn't	1
even	0
looking	1
for	0
a	0
car	1
when	0
i	1
bought	1
this	0
car	1
i	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
thinking	1
about	1
buying	1
a	0
prelude	1
from	0
a	1
friend	1
who	0
was	0
moving	1
to	0
new	1
york	1
or	0
something	1
so	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
gonna	1
sell	0
her	0
car	1
because_1	0
she	0
didn't	0
need	1
it	0
anymore	1
and	0
it	1
was	1
only	1
like	1
a	0
year	1
old	1
and	0
i	1
had	0
never	0
driven	1
uh	0
a	0
prelude	1
so	1
i	0
went	1
to	0
a	0
dealership	1
because	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
uh	0
the	0
same	1
year	1
and	1
same	1
model	1
of	1
prelude	1
on	0
their	0
used	1
car	1
lot	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
test	1
drove	1
it	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
just	0
fell	1
in	0
love	1
with	1
this	0
brand	1
new	1
white	1
prelude	1
you	0
know	1
two	1
liter	0
si	1
with	0
the	1
the	0
sun	1
roof	1
and	0
the	0
moon	1
roof	1
and	1

oh	1
yeah	0

they're	0
nice	1
i	0
think	1

and	1
i	1
i	0
bought	1
it	0
loaded	1

oh	1
yeah	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
them_1	0
loaded	1
i	1

i	1
mean	1

i	1
i	0
love	1
all	0
those	1
little	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
don't	0
need	1
but	0
they're	1
so	0
wonderful	1

yeah	0
i	1
went	1
there	1
looking	0
at	1
a	1
used	1
car	1
and	0
two	0
days	1
later	1
i	0
bought	1
this	0
car	1
i	1

i	0
felt	1
i	0
felt	1
like	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
worst	1
impulse	1
that	1
w[as]	0
that	1
was	0
the	0
largest	1
impulse	0
buy	1
i	0
had	1
ever	0
made	1
the	1

the	1
oth[er]	0
the	0
two	1
other	0
things	1
that	0
i've	0
bought	1
on	0
impulse	1
are	0
vcr	1
and	0
a	0
washer	1
and	0
dryer	1

i	0
would	0
say	1

i	0
go	1
for	0
the	0
big	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
i	0
noticed	1
mine	1
was	0
definitely	1
not	0
impulse	1
i	0
really	1
needed	0
a	0
new	0
car	1
mine	1
was	0
just	1
it's	0
getting	1
worn	1
out	0
i	0
guess	1
from	0
being	1
a	0
sports	0
car	1
i	0
drove	1
it	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	1
got	0
it	0
right	1
after	0
high	0
school	1
so	0
by	0
the	0
time	1
i	0
traded	1
it	0
in	1
it	1
was	0
ready	1

yeah	1
i	0
got	1
i	0
got	1
my	1
buick	1
as	0
a	0
high	1
school	1
graduation	0
gift	1

ready	1
to	0
go	1

did	0
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
this	0
[what'n/wasn't]	1
really	1
an	0
impulse	1
i	0
mean	0
buying	1
it	0
right	1
then	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
right	1
quickly	1
was	0
kind	1
of	0
impulsive	1
but	1
i'd	1
been	0
thinking	1
about	0
buying	1
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
three	1
years	1
and	1
i	0
was	1
just	1
scared	1
to	0

right	1

i	1
was	0
scared	1
to	0
start	0
taking	1
on	0
payments	1
because	0
the	0
buick	1
was	0
long	1
since	0
paid	1
for	0

right	1
that's	0
same	1
with	0
me	1
would	0
you	1
ever	0
buy	1
a	0
used	0
car	1
for	1
a	0
new	0
car	1
for	0
yourself	1

buy	0
a	1
buy	1
buy	1
a	0
used	0
car	1

like	1

right	1

sure	1

i	1
i	0
was	1
going	0
to	0
buy	1
one	0
once	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
worry	1
about	1
who's	0
driven	1
them_1	0
and	0
what	0
they've	1
been	0
through	1
and	0
the	0
warranties	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
just	1

yeah	0

just	1
i	0
can't	1
seem	0
to	0
get	1
over	0
that	1
that	0
just	1
bothers	0
me	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
why	1

well	1
um	0
like	1
on	0
hondas	1
they	1
supposedly	1
the	0
maintenance	1
records	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
registered	1
with	0
honda	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0
you	1
can	0
request	1
whatever	0
maintenance	1
records	1
exist	1
on	0
cars	1
and	1
you	0
can	0
have	1
them_1	0
checked	1
out	0
by	0
mechanics	1
and	0
stuff	1

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

mean	1
they	0
can't	1
stop	1
you	0
from	1
doing	1
it	1
so	1

hoping	1
that	0
they	0
do	1
go	0
to	0
a	0
honda	1
dealership	1
to	0
get	0
them_1	0
serviced	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

well	1
and	0
even	1
if	0
they	0
didn't	1
you	0
can	0
still	1
get	0
a	0
good	1
idea	1
from	1
a	1
if	0
you	1
can	0
get	1
a	0
good	1
mechanic	1
to	0
check	1
it	0
over	1
real	0
carefully	1
and	0
check	1
the	1
blocks	1
and	0
everything	1

yeah	1

that's	0
true	1

so	0

well	1
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
all	1

okay	1
well	0
i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	1
to	0
you	1

i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	0
to	0
you	1

bye-bye	1

bye-bye	1

all	1
right	1

have	1
you	1
ever	1
been	1
drug	1
tested	1

um	1
that's	1
a	0
good	1
question	1
um	1
uh	0
i	0
had	1
a	1
job	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
get	0
a	1
blood	1
test	1
for	1

uh-huh	0

um	1
and	1

and	1
they	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
a	1
full	1
blood	1
screen	1
on	1
me	1
but	1
they	1
didn't	1
call	1
that	0
a	1
drug	1
test	1
so	1
tha[t]	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
checked	1
for	1
drugs	1
they	0
just	1
don't	1
tell	1
you	0
they	1
did	1

yeah	1

i	0
had	1
i've	1
had	0
uh	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
drug	1
tests	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
before	1
i	0
could	1
start	0
working	1
at	0
a	1
job	1
uh	0
different	1
jobs	1
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
had	0
one	1
at	1
ti	1
and	1
then	1
one	1
at	1
another	0
engineering	1
company	0
and	1
really	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
don't	0
mind	1
them	1
i	1
don't	1
do	0
drugs	1
anyway	1
i	1
guess	1
if	1
i	0
did	1
maybe	1
i	1
would	1
but	0
um	0
i	1
don't	1
know	1
i	1
know	1
a	1
girl	1
that	1
she's	1
a	1
nurse	1
and	0
they	1
get	1
drug	0
tested	1
randomly	1
i've	1
never	0
been	1
randomly	1
drug	1
tested	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
that	1
would	1
probably	1
bother	1
me	1
to	1
wake	1
up	1
one	1
day	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
halfway	1
through	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
you're	0
going	1
to	1
be	1
drug	1
tested	1
and	1
you	1
didn't	1
know	1
about	1
it	1

yeah	1
well	1
i	0
guess	1
it	1
depends	1
on	0
if	1
you	0
got	1
something	1
to	0
worry	1
about	0

yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
so	0
i	0
guess	1
so	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
it's	0
right	1

well	1
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
i	0
come	1
from	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
biased	1
opinion	1
because	1
i'm	1
a	1
a	1
therapist	1
and	1
a	0
drug	1
and	0
alcohol	1
counselor	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
i've	1
done	1
employee	1
assistant	1
work	0
and	1
i	0
i	1
know	1
the	0
the	1
kind	1
of	1
cost	1
businesses	1
go	1
through	1
in	1
terms	1
of	0
accidents	1
on	1
the	0
job	1
that	0
are	0
specifically	1
drug	0
and	0
alcohol	0
related	1

right	0

right	1

and	0
it's	0
like	1
in	0
the	0
billions	1
of	1
dollars	1
every	1
year	1
um	0
and	1
th[e]	0
the	0
only	0
way	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
prevent	1
that	0
is	0
is	0
you	1
know	0
making	1
sure	1
that	0
the	0
employees	1
are	1
drug	1
and	1
alcohol	1
free	1

that's	0
true	1

and	1
you	1
know	1
the	0
the	1
problem	1
in	1
the	0
work	1
place	1
is	0
that	1
that	1
people	1
are	1
like	1
if	0
your	0
boss	1
is	0
your	0
drinking	1
buddy	1
or	0
whatever	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
can	0
come	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
work	1
drunk	1
and	0
get	1
in	1
an	1
accident	1
and	0
he'll	1
cover	0
up	1
for	0
you	0
and	1
nobody	0
knows	1
about	0
it	0
but	1

right	0

but	1
c[ould]	0
you	1
know	1
ends	1
up	0
costing	1
the	1
company	1
lots	1
and	1
lots	1
of	1
money	1

that's	1
true	1

so	1

i	1
believe	1
it's	0
right	1
especially	1
for	0
certain	1
jobs	1

you	1
know	0
there	1

i	0
think	0
anyone	1
in	0
a	0
in	1
a	0
public	1
job	0
like	1
bus	1
drivers	1
and	1
cab	1
drivers	0
and	0
police	1
officers	0
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
i	1

uh-huh	0

i	1
think	0
they	1
should	0
be	0
randomly	1
drug	1
tested	0
i	1

yeah	1

i	1
believe	0
full	1
force	1
in	0
that	1

yeah	0

i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
i	1
believe	1
every	0
secretary	1
in	0
every	0
company	1
needs	0
to	1
be	1

true	1

you	1
know	0
secretaries	1
aren't	0
aren't	1
really	0
going	1
to	0
cost	1
the	0
company	1
that	1
much	0
money	1
if	0
they	0
fall	1
face	1
forward	0
in	0
their	1
typewriter	1
or	0
something	1
so	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i'm	1
kind	0
of	0
biased	1
too	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
do	1
drugs	0
and	0
so	1
i	1
really	0
don't	1
care	1
one	0
way	0
or	0
another	1
if	0
anybody	1
wants	0
to	0
pull	0
me	0
up	0
tomorrow	1
and	0
test	1
me	0
because	0
i	0
have	1
nothing	0
to	1
worry	1
about	0

uh-huh	1

yeah	0

so	0
i	1
guess	1
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
biased	1

yeah	0
well	1
and	0
it's	0
i	0
i	0
think	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
problems	1
with	0
it	0
is	0
it	0
affects	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
other	1
folks	0
on	0
the	0
job	1
if	0
somebody	0
else	1
is	0
impaired	1

yeah	1
it	1
does	1

because	1
generally	1
you	0
know	1
it	0
um	0
you	0
find	0
out	1
one	1
way	0
or	0
another	1
if	0
somebody's	1
got	0
a	0
problem	1
on	0
the	0
job	1

yeah	1
that's	1
true	0

and	1
if	0
e[ven]	0
even	1
if	0
like	1
you	0
say	1
even	1
if	0
it's	0
just	1
the	0
secretary	1
if	0
her	0
work	1
or	0
abilities	1
start	0
affecting	1
her	0
coworkers	1
then	1
it	0
it's	0
still	1
a	0
problem	1

yeah	0

that's	0
true	1

so	0

but	0
what	1
do	0
you	0
do	1
about	0
the	1
occasional	1
user	0
that	1
may	1
have	0
gone	1
to	0
a	0
party	1
three	1
days	0
before	1

and	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
it's	0
been	1
the	0
whole	0
weekend	1
since	0
they've	0
done	1
anything	0
and	0
they	0
happen	1
to	1
be	1
tested	1
monday	1
morning	1
and	0
they	1
could	0
be	1
fired	1
for	0
that	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
unfair	0
also	1

well	0
yeah	0
i	0
guess	1
it	1
comes	1
with	0
the	0
turf	1

yeah	0
i	1
guess	0
so	1
i	1
guess	0
if	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
suffer	1
the	1
consequences	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	1
you're	0
i[n]	0
i[n]	0
in	0
terms	1
of	0
drugs	1
they're	0
illegal	1
so	0
you're	0
you're	0
breaking	1
the	0
law	0
anyway	1

that's	1
true	0

that's	0
true	1

probably	1
the	0
the	0
biggest	1
problem	0
with	0
those	1
is	0
they	0
don't	1
do	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
job	1
of	0
of	1
assessing	1
for	1
alcohol	1

that's	1
true	1

and	0
that's	1
probably	0
the	0
biggest	1
problem	0
there	0
is	1

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
so	1
more	1
than	0
drugs	1
and	1
i	1
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
companies	0
that	0
will	1
put	1
you	0
in	0
an	0
alcohol	1
rehabilitation	0
before	1
they	0
would	0
put	0
you	0
in	0
a	0
drug	1
rehab	0

yeah	0

they	0
would	1
pay	1
for	0
an	0
alcohol	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
they	1
don't	0
always	1
pay	1
for	1
drug	1
rehabilitation	0

well	0
i	1
guess	1
that's	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
positive	1
things	0
that	1
ha[s]	0
has	1
come	0
out	1
of	0
it	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
employee	0
assistance	1
program	1
if	1
you	0
do	1
test	0
positive	1
for	0
something	1
they	0
will	1
give	0
you	1
an	0
opp[ortunity]	1
o[pportunity]	0
opportunity	1
to	1
go	1
get	0
your	0
life	1
straight	0
rather	1
than	0
to	0
lose	1
your	0
job	1

yeah	0

that's	1
true	0

and	0
i	1
th[ink]	0

i	1
think	0
that's	0
fair	1

th[ink]	0

yeah	1
and	0
i	1
think	1
the	1
benef[its]	1
the	1
company	1
benefits	0
in	0
the	1
long	1
run	0

yeah	1
that's	1
true	0
that's	1
about	0
all	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
say	0
on	1
it	0

what	1
what	1
kind	0
of	0
testing	1
do	0
they	0
do	1
when	0
you	0
went	1

uh	0
it's	0
a	0
urine	1
test	0

urine	0
screen	1
yeah	1

and	1
they	0
uh	0

yeah	1

it	0
was	0
really	1
very	1
official	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
in	1
a	0
room	1
solely	1
by	0
yourself	0
sign	0
papers	1
that	0
say	1
you	0
were	0
totally	1
alone	1
sign	1
papers	0
that	0
say	1
this	0
is	0
yours	1
and	0

and	0
and	0
you	1
have	0
to	0
fill	1
the	0
bottle	1
yourself	1
and	0
label	1
it	0
yourself	1
and	0
all	1
of	0
that	1
so	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
that	0
they're	0
sure	1
that	0
you	0
haven't	1
borrowed	1
anybody's	0
i	0
guess	1
or	0
something	1

well	1
that	1
happens	1

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
i	0

i	0
ca[n't]	1
it's	0
hard	1
to	0
believe	1
but	0

it	0
happens	1
a	1
lot	1

but	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
does	1

there	0
there	0
are	0
people	1
that	0
kn[ow]	0
pay	1
other	0
people	0
for	0
that	0
to	0
help	1
them	0
out	0

i	0
know	1
i'm	0
amazed	1
at	0
the	0
things	0
people	1
will	0
do	1

yeah	1

it	0
is	1
amazing	1
i	0
guess	1
there	0
are	1
people	0
that	0
do	1
that	0
and	0
they	1
are	0
those	1
are	0
expensive	0
tests	1
i'm	0
glad	1
i	0
never	0
had	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
one	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
it	0
depends	1
r[eally]	0
r[eally]	0
really	1
on	0
how	1
how	0
strong	1
a	0
test	0
it	0
is	1
they've	0
got	0
different	0
degrees	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
as	0
how	1
far	0
back	1
they	0
can	0
check	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	0
so	1

they	0
got	1
some	0
unusual	1
things	0
besides	1
blood	0
and	0
urine	1
tests	0
they've	0
they've	1
got	0
some	1
companies	0
that	0
are	0
doing	1
um	0
hair	1
tests	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1
well	0
that	1
they'll	0
pull	1
out	0
one	0
of	0
your	0
hairs	1
and	0
they	0
can	0
apparently	1
test	1
um	0
back	1
a	0
certain	0
period	0
of	0
time	1
um	0
because	1
um	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
residue	1
ends	0
up	0
in	0
your	0
hair	1
follicles	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0

how	1
weird	1
i	0
didn't	1
know	0
that	1

it's	0
kind	1
of	0

oh	0
that's	0
weird	1

hair	1
follicles	0
i	0
guess	1
are	0
just	0
dead	0
protein	1
and	0
they	0

yeah	1

and	0
it	0
it's	0
apparently	1
al[most]	1
almost	0
like	1
a	0
a	0
calendar	1
they	0
they've	0
got	1
it	0
pretty	1
precise	1
now	1
that	0
they	1
can	1
go	0
back	1
and	0
look	1
at	1
in	0
terms	0
of	0
growth	1
in	0
a	0
hair	1
when	1
you	0
used	1
and	1
and	0
that	1
type	0
of	0
thing	0

that's	1
wild	1

so	1

it's	1
amazing	1
the	0
things	1
they	0
can	0
find	0
out	1
from	0
different	0
things	1
on	0
your	0
body	1

yeah	0
so	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
they	0
perfect	1
that	1
and	0
then	0
it's	0
not	1
quite	1
as	0
cumbersome	1
as	0
having	0
to	0
go	0
fill	1
a	0
bottle	1
or	0
give	0
blood	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0
that's	1
true	1

that's	1
true	0
i'm	1
glad	1
i	0
never	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
by	0
giving	0
blood	1
i	0
can't	1
stand	1
the	1
thought	1
of	0
giving	0
blood	1

uh-huh	0

i	0
can't	1
even	0
do	1
it	0
for	0
wadley	1
even	0
though	0
it's	0
a	0
good	0
cause	1

yeah	0

well	0
i	0
enjoyed	1
talking	1
to	0
you	0

well	1
i	1
did	0
too	1

thank	1
you	0

uh-huh	0
bye	1

bye	1
bye	0

bye	1
bye	0

okay	1
so	1
what	1
kind	1
of	0
experience	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
you	1
have	1
then	1
with	1
child	1
care	1

i	1
guess	1
i	1
think	1
um	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
that	1
worked	1

does	0
it	1
say	1
something	1

i	1
think	1
it	1
usually	1
does	1
you	1
might	1
try	1
um	1
i	1
don't	1
know	0
hold	1
it	1
down	1
a	0
little	1
longer	1
okay	1

okay	1
well	1
does	0
it	0
usually	1
make	0
a	0
recording	1
or	0
s[omething]	0

okay	1
i	0
well	0
i	0
don't	1
remember	1
it	0

it	0
seemed	1
like	0
it	0
did	1
but	0
it	0
might	1
not	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
guess	1
we	1
can	0
start	1
um	0

okay	1

okay	1

no	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
have	0
any	0
kids	1
i	0
um	0
my	0
sister	1
has	0
a	0
she	1
just	1
had	1
a	1
baby	1
he's	1
about	1
five	1
months	1
old	1
and	1
she	1
was	0
worrying	1
about	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
work	1
and	0
what	1
she	1
was	0
gonna	0
do	1
with	0
him	1
and	0
the	0
different	1

um-hum	1

do	1
you	1
have	1
kids	1

i	1
have	0
three	1

oh	0
really	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
i	0
do	1
yes	1
um	1
i	1
don't	0
work	1
though	1
but	1
i	0
used	1
to	0
work	1
and	1
when	0
i	0
had	0
two	1
children	0

um-hum	0

i	1
work	0
off	1
and	0
on	1
just	0
temporarily	1
and	0
usually	1
find	0
friends	1
to	0
babysit	1
but	1
i	1
don't	0
envy	1
anybody	1
who's	0
in	1
that	0
situation	1
to	0
find	1
day	1
care	1

yeah	1

but	1
does	0
your	1
sister	1
live	0
in	0
a	0
big	1
community	1

um	1
yeah	1
she	0
lives	1
it's	1
a	1
it's	1
a	1
fairly	1
large	1
community	1
she	1
um	0
got	0
real	1
lucky	1
though	1
she	1
had	0
a	0
boss	1
who	1
um	0
moved	1
into	0
a	0
larger	0
office	1

um-hum	1

and	0
she's	1
able	1
to	1
take	0
her	1
baby	0
to	0
work	0
with	1
her	0

oh	1
really	1

and	1
it's	1
a	0
small	1
office	1
that	0
she	0
works	1
in	0

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
it's	0
a	0
it's	1
a	0
legal	1
firm	1
office	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
one	1
lawyer	1

um	0

and	0
so	0
she's	1
the	0
only	1
one	1
really	1
that	0
takes	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
office	1
there's	0
no	1
one	1
else	0
that	0
works	1
there	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	1
they	1
have	0
an	0
extra	0
room	1
and	1
everything	1
for	0
the	1
baby	1
so	0
it	0
works	1
out	0
pretty	0
good	1
for	0
her	1

wow	1

how	0
lucky	1
i	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
around	0
here	1
sometimes	0
have	1
like	0
mothers	1
or	0
grandmothers	1
that	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
their	0
kids	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
but	0
the	0
community	1
i'm	1
in	0
is	0
not	1
a	0
real	1
large	1
one	1
so	0
there	1
are	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	1
babysit	1
in	0
their	1
home	1
that	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
either	0
know	1
them	0
or	0
know	0
somebody	1
who	0
knows	1
them	0
to	0
get	1
to	0

yeah	1
so	0
it's	0
fairly	1
safe	1

yeah	1
to	1
get	0
references	1
and	0
that	1
so	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
i	0
do[n't]	0
don't	1
feel	0
comfortable	1
about	0
leaving	1
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
big	0
day	1
care	0
center	1
but	0
simply	1
because_1	1
there's	0
so	1
many	0
kids	1
and	0
so	1
many	0

worried	1
that	1
they're	0
not	1
going	1
to	0
get	1
enough	0
attention	1

yeah	1
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
colds	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
get	0
spread	1
real	0
easy	1
and	0
things	1

yeah	1

but	0
and	0
they're	1
expensive	1
and	0
course	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
different	0
types	1
of	0
day	1
care	1
available	0
too	1
you	1
know	1
where	0
they	0
teach	1
them	1
academic	1
things	0

yes	1

or	1
they	0
just	1
watch	1
them	0
and	0
let	0
them_1	0
play	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
but	0
take	0
a	1
long	0
time	1
to	0
find	1
the	1
right	0
place	1

yeah	1
and	0
you	0
and	0
you	0
don't	1
always	0
even	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
it's	0
gonna	1
be	1
the	1
right	1
place	1
or	1
not	1

um-hum	0

anything	1
i	0
guess	1
could	0
happen	1

um-hum	0

because	1
after	1
i	1
guess	1
after	1
he	0
you	1
know	1
gets	1
to	0
a	0
certain	1
age	1
she's	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
to	0
take	0
him	1
to	0
a	0
day	1
care	0

um-hum	1
when	0
he	0
starts	0
toddling	1
around	1
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

when	0
when	0
he's	0
not	1
when	0
she	0
can't	1
keep	1
control	1
of	0
him	0
and	1
he	1
starts	1
crawling	1
that's	0

um-hum	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
hard	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
kind	0
of	0
stressful	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
nice	1
to	0
have	0
him	0
around	1

um-hum	1

but	1
um	0
seems	1
like	0
you	1
know	0
go[lly]	1
what	0
if	0
he	0
cried	1
at	0
the	0
wrong	1
time	0
or	1
the	0
phone	1
rang	1
or	0
you	1
know	0
at	0
the	0
wrong	1
time	1

yeah	1

but	1

i	0
think	1
she	0
has	0
problems	1
with	0
that	1
too	1

um-hum	0
well	1
when	0
you	1
have	0
kids	1
will	0
you	1
work	1
do	0
you	0
work	1
now	1

i	1
don't	1
know	0
that's	0

that's	0
something	1
i've	0
considered	1
um	1

um-hum	0

i	1
always	1
kind	0
of	1
think	1
it	1
would	0
be	1
neat	1
to	0
be	1
able	0
to	1
watch	1
them_1	0
and	0
be	1
there	0
for	0
them_1	0
all	1
the	0
time	1

um-hum	0

is	0
that	1
what	0
you	0
do	1

um	0
yeah	1
uh	0
actually	1
i	0
teach	1
my	0
kids	1
at	0
home	1
so	0
i'm	1
here	0
all	1
the	0
time	0

oh	1
so	0
they	1
don't	0
go	0
to	0
school	1
is	0
it	0
like	0
um	0
oh	1
what's	1
that	1
called	1
it's	0
a	1
correspondence	1
school	1
they	0
do	0
it	0
at	0
home	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

that's	1
interesting	1

so	1

do	0
you	1
have	1
to	0
have	1
any	0
special	0
training	1

not	1
it	1
depends	1
on	1
the	0
state	1
you	0
live	1
actually	1
some	0
laws	1
absolutely	1
prohibit	1
it	0
some	1
states	1
um	0
say	0
that	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
certified	1
teacher	1
in	0
order	0
to	0
do	1
that	0
our	1
state	0
doesn't	1
yet	1
say	1
that	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
a	0
certified	1
teacher	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
college	1
but	0
i	0
you	1
know	0
but	0
my	0
kids	1
are	0
only	0
elementary	1
grades	0
levels	1
right	0
now	1
and	1
so	1

so	0
they	1
haven't	0
been	0
to	0
public	1
schools	0
at	0
all	1

one	1
of	0
them_1	0
was	0
for	0
a	0
couple	1
of	0
years	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
know	0
my	0
oldest	1
he	1
was	0
and	0
then	0
my	0
youngest	0
two	1
have	0
never	0
been	1

hm	0

engineer	1

the	0
laboratory	1
rolm	1
laboratory	0
griffis	1

unrequir[ed]	1
what's	0
the	0
word	1
i'm	0
looking	0
for	0
uh	1
lots	1
of	0
affection	0
no	1
co[nditional]	0
unconditional	1
affection	0
from	1
the	0
from	0
the	0
dog	1

right	1

that's	1
it	1

yeah	1
yeah	1

really	1
not	1
critical	1
at	0
all	1

no	1
no	1

yeah	1
they're	0
really	1
wonderful	1

yeah	1
well	1
it's	0
been	0
nice	1
talking	0
to	0
you	0
we	0
seem	1
to	0
be	0
degenerating	1
here	0
so	1

okay	1

[ok]ay	1
um	1
so	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
um	1
about	1
putting	1
an	1
elderly	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
it	1
varies	1
on	1
on	1
the	1
individual	1
basis	1

hm	1

uh	1
sometimes	1
it	1
is	1
there's	1
no	1
alternative	1

um-hum	1

uh	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
have	1
uh	0
uh	0
family	1
available	1
or	0
family	1
that's	0
uh	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
even	0
have	1
family	1
that	1
is	1
uh	1
in	1
and	1
who	1
around	1

that's	1
true	1
yeah	1

so	1
sometimes	1
it's	1
not	1
an	1
alternative	1

hm	0

and	1
i	1
think	1
uh	1
but	1
i	1
think	1
also	1
sometimes	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
uh	1
a	1
benefit	1
if	0
it's	0
for	0
a	1
short	0
time	1
sometimes	1
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0

um-hum	0

um	1
especially	1
after	0
if	1
it's	0
after	1
an	0
acute	0
illness	1
to	1
get	1
over	1
a	0
uh	0
or	1
to	1
rehab	1
after	1
uh	0
an	0
illness	1

that's	1
true	1
i	0
never	0
thought	1
of	0
that	1
yeah	0

sometimes	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
sometimes	1
the	0
nursing	1
homes	0
are	0
good	1
for	0
uh	0
just	1
short	1
periods	1
of	0
time	1

that's	0
true	1
until	1
they	0
get	0
over	0
that	0
hump	1
of	0
whatever	1
it	1
is	0
they're	1
dealing	1
with	0

um-hum	1

because	1
too	1
often	1
the	1
acute	1
hospitals	1
will	0
are	1
sending	1
them_1	1
out	1
much	1
faster	1
than	1
what	1
they're	0
really	0
able	1
to	1

yes	1

they	1
really	1
are	1
they	1
don't	0
like	0
to	0
keep	1
them	1
longer	1
than	1
a	0
week	0

so	1
so	0
there	1
is	1
some	1
good	1
to	1
it	0

yeah	1

uh	1
sometimes	1
too	1
it's	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
dumb	1
job	0
you	1
know	1
the	1
fam[ilies]	1
well	1
the	0
families	1
do	0
not	1
necessarily	1
uh	0
know	0
what	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
them_1	0
and	0

what	1
do	0
you	0
mean	1

and	0
they	0
don't	1
wanna	0
take	0
the	0
responsibility	1
so	0
they	0
will	0
put	1
them_1	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	0
home	0

yeah	1
that's	1
true	1

so	0
you	1
see	1
uh	0
there's	0
both	1
sides	1
to	0
it	1
too	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
think	0

yeah	1
and	0
it	1
depends	1
on	1
how	1
how	0
sick	1
the	0
person	1
is	0
too	1
and	1
what	1
you're	0
capable	1
of	0
like	1
if	0
you	0
have	1
a	1
family	1
to	1
take	0
care	1
of	1
you	0
know	1
of	0
your	0
own	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
um	1
i	1
would	1
personally	0
like	1
it	0
if	0
my	1
parents	0
were	0
to	1
get	0
ill	1
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
take	1
care	0
of	0
them	1
at	0
home	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
the	1
money	0
with	0
some	0
help	1
that's	1
not	0
always	0
possible	1

that's	1
true	1

but	1
um	0
to	1
the	0
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
i'd	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
it	0
until	1
it	1
gets	1
impossible	1

i	1
think	1
that's	1
also	1
where	1
you're	1
gonna	0
to	0
have	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	0
are	1
going	1
to	0
it's	0
there's	0
not	0
a	0
choice	1
it's	0
because_1	1
there	0
it's	0
not	1
economically	0
feasible	1
even	0
to	1
put	1
them_1	0
in	1
a	1
nursing	0
home	1

right	1

um-hum	1

yeah	1

so	0
that	0
that	0
option	1
sometimes	1
is	0
not	0
available	1
if	0
they	1
do	0
not	0
have	0
the	0
uh	0
either	0
medicare	1
or	0
insurance	1
to	0
cover	1
it	0

that's	0
true	1
yeah	0

so	0

but	1
i	1
think	0
nursing	0
homes	0
can	1
be	0
good	0
just	0
depends	0
on	0
what	0
kind	1
they	0
are	0
you	0
know	1
an	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
check	0
them_1	0
out	0
ahead	1
of	0
time	0

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
there's	1
also	1
some	1
that	0
are	0
set	1
up	1
for	0
specialties	1
uh	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
i	1
know	0
some	0
el[derly]	0
unfortunately	1
some	1
elderly	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	0
or	1
have	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
alzheimer's	1
or	0
where	0
they	1
wander	1
or	0
or	0
um	0
confused	1
or	1
have	0
some	1
mental	1
problems	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1
that	1
they're	1

and	1
you	1
need	1
a	1
special	1
nursing	1
home	0
for	0
that	1
you	0
need	1
one	1
that	0
has	0
a	0
unit	1
that's	0
locked	1
where	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	0
to	0
get	0
out	1
and	0
roam	0
around	1

yeah	1

and	0
you	0
need	0
people	1
who	0
are	0
trained	1
for	0
that	0
type	1
of	0
problem	1

right	1

an[d]	0
know	1
what	1
they're	0
doing	1
with	0
that	0

yeah	0
so	1
so	0
there's	0
different	1
types	1
of	0
nursing	0
homes	0
i	0
think	1

yeah	1
well	0
my	1
uh	0
grandmother's	1
not	1
really	1
in	0
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
but	0
a	0
retirement	1
home	1
that	0
also	0
has	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
sort	1
of	0
attached	1
to	1
it	0
and	1
she	1
really	1
liked	1
the	0
idea	0
of	1
of	1
moving	1
there	0
she's	1
not	0
ill	1
yet	1

um-hum	1

but	1
um	0
she	1
worked	0
there	1
as	0
a	1
volunteer	1
for	1
about	0
ten	1
years	1
and	0
then	1
she	1
decided	1
that	1
um	0
she's	1
eighty	1
five	0
years	0
old	1
that	0
eventually	1
you	1
know	1
she	1
she	0
doesn't	1
want	1
her	0
family	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
her	0
and	0
being	0
a	0
burden	1
she's	0
very	0
independent	1
so	0
she's	1
in	0
this	0
nursing	1
home	0
it's	0
out	0
in	0
the	0
country	1
and	1
um	0
she	0
really	1
enjoys	1
it	0
right	0
now	1
because	1
she	0
doesn't	1
have	0
to	0
wash	0
dishes	1
or	0
cook	1

gives	1
her	0
a	1
little	0
bit	0
of	1
her	1
own	1
independence	1
but	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
she	0
still	1
has	1
uh	0
a	1
security	1
there	0

right	1
some	1
support	1
and	0
then	0
there's	0
also	1
a	0
sort	0
of	0
a	0
wing	1
for	0
those	1
people	0
that	0
do	1
get	0
sick	0
and	0
what	1
i	1
like	0
about	1
it	1
and	1
i	0
think	0
she	1
likes	0
about	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
she	0
knows	1
everybody	0
there	0
now	1
and	1
then	1
so	1
if	0
she	0
ever	0
does	1
become	0
ill	0
um	0
it'll	1
be	0
like	0
family	1
around	0
her	0

that's	0
right	1
and	0
i	0
i've	0
seen	1
some	0
of	0
them	0
like	0
that	1
too	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
also	1
they	0
have	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
activities	1
going	1
on	1
for	0
the	1
ones	1
who	1
are	1
more	0
active	1

um-hum	1

yeah	1
sh[e]	1

so	0
it's	0
not	1
sort	0
of	0
like	0
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
sick	1
place	0

um-hum	0

no	1
she	0
loves	1
it	1
she	1
had	0
a	0
great	1
social	1
life	0
and	0
she	0
travels	1
and	0
um	0
it's	0
in	0
in	0
missouri	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
mountains	1
and	0
it's	0
beautiful	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
i	1
hope	1
that	0
i	1
have	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
when	0
i	1
get	0
older	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
of	1
the	0
um	0
i	1
think	1
the	1
the	0
decision	1
that	0
needs	0
to	0
be	1
made	1
though	0
on	1
nursing	1
home	0
has	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
joint	1
one	0
between	0
the	0
the	0
uh	0
elderly	1
uh	0
person	1
who's	0
going	0
in	1
and	0
the	1
family	1
that's	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
uh	0
effec[ted]	1
effected	1
by	0
it	0

um-hum	0

oh	0

oh	0
definitely	1
it's	0

and	0
uh	0
you	1
know	1
sometimes	1
it	1
can	0
those	0
choi[ces]	1
those	0
choices	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
in	0
advance	1
and	0
sometimes	1
the	1
choices	1
uh	0
because	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	0
the	0
illness	1
when	0
they're	0

right	1

okay	1
so	1
i	1
guess	1
it	1
starts	1
recording	1
now	1

okay	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
really	1
know	1
that	1
much	1
about	1
the	1
recycling	1
in	1
this	1
area	1
that	0
we're	1
in	1
we	1
live	0
in	1
the	1
saginaw	1
area	1

saginaw	1

um-hum	1
and	0
i'm	0
not	1
real	0
familiar	1
with	0
uh	0
anything	1
that	0
i	0
i[n]	1
fact	1
the	1
far	0
as	1
i	1
know	0
the	1
school	1
doesn't	0
have	1
any	1
kind	0
of	1
programs	1
or	1
anything	1
out	1
here	1
and	1
uh	1
or	1
the	1
grocery	1
story	1
or	1
anything	1
in	1
this	1
area	1

really	1

yeah	1

the	1
rec[ycling]	0
we	1
live	1
in	1
plano	1
and	1
they	1
started	0
off	1
recycling	1
by	0
um	1
putting	1
the	0
i	0
think	0
at	1
each	0
wal-mart	1
they	0
had	1
some	0
recycling	1
dumpsters	1
and	1
things	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
i[t]	0
now	1
i	0
guess	1
the	1
uh	0
city	1
h[as]	0
has	0
bought	1
these	0
big	1
green	1
trash	1
cans	1
and	1
uh	0
we	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
recycling	1
truck	1
that	1
comes	1
around	1
now	1
and	1
you	0
separate	1
your	1
glass	1
and	1
paper	1
and	0
uh	1
aluminum	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
you	1
set	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
they	1
pick	1
it	0
up	1
and	1
i[t]	1
it	1
works	1
real	1
neat	1
they	1
seem	1
to	0
be	0
having	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
response	1

really	1

but	0

that	0
is	1
pretty	0
good	0
i'm	1
we're	1
originally	1
from	0
another	1
state	1
and	0
i	0
know	1
in	0
the	0
state	0
we	0
were	0
from	1
that	0
they	0
did	1
that	0
ty[pe]	0
similar	1
type	0
thing	0
the	0
city	1
brought	0
out	1
you	1
know	1
se[parate]	1
tra[sh]	1
separate	1
trash	1
cans	1
and	1
you	1
separated	1
your	1
stuff	1
and	0
you	1
put	1
it	0
in	1
there	1
and	0
they	1
took	1
it	0
you	1
know	1

did	0
they	1
did	0
they	1
like	1
on	1
bottles	1
did	0
they	1
give	1
you	0
a	0
so	1
many	1
cents	1
back	1
for	1
for	0
cans	1
even	0

i	1
don't	0
really	1
know	1

even	0
i've	1
seen	1

i	1
don't	1
really	1
know	1
they	0
they	1
started	1
after	1
we	1
moved	1
down	1
here	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
i'm	1
not	0
really	0
familiar	1
i	0

seen	1
that	0

i	0
just	1
know	1
that	1
and	1
my	0
in-laws	1
up	0
in	1
up	1
in	0
oklahoma	1
that's	0
how	0
they	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
they	0
pick	1
it	0
up	1
but	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
if	1
they	1
get	1
a	0
get	0
anything	0
back	1
on	1
it	0
or	0
do	0
you	1
get	0
money	1
for	0
it	0

no	1
i've	0
just	1
i	1
noticed	1
in	1
iowa	1
and	0
other	0
cities	1
like	0
that	1
it's	0
a	0
nickel	1
per	1
aluminum	0
can	1

oh	1

so	0
you	0
don't	1
see	1
too	1
many	0
thrown	1
out	1
around	0
the	1
streets	1
even	0
bottles	1

really	1

you	1
know	0
all	0
kinds	1
of	1
bottles	1
they	1
they	1
they	0
really	0
charge	1
people	1
to	0
uh	1
i	0
guess	0
when	0
you	1
purchase	1
them_1	0
and	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you	1
turn	1
them_1	0
back	0
in	1

right	1

i	0
know	0
i	1
remember	1
the	0
old	1
days	1
as	0
a	1
kid	1
where	1
a	1
bottle	1
was	0
a	1
nickel	1
an[d]	0

right	1
and	0
now	1
now	1
most	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	1
th[e]	0
throwaway	1

right	1

so	1
maybe	1
that's	0
one	1
thing	0
they	1
could	0
do	1

i	1
think	0
now	1
they're	0
a	1
lot	0
more	0
expensive	1
than	0
that	1
um	0
i	1
bought	1
some	0
cokes	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
in	0
the	1
br[ead]	1
the	1
little	0
bottles	1
you	1
know	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
the	1
bottles	1
were	1
like	0
i	1
know	0
they	1
were	0
at	1
least	1
ten	1
cents	0
apiece	1
i	1
was	0
trying	1
to	0
figure	1
out	1
how	0
i	0
was	0
like	0
god	1
how	1
much	0
were	0
those	1
bottles	0
you	0
know	0

well	0
that's	1

and	0
it	1
was	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
like	0
uh	0
eight	0
an[d]	0
and	1
eight	1
and	0
ten	1
packs	0
you	0
know	1
instead	0
of	0
six	1
packs	0

right	1

and	0
uh	1
and	0
they	1
were	1
like	0
it	0
was	1
like	1
two	1
dollars	1
and	0
something	0
for	1
the	0
bottles	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
was	0
like	0
god	1
almighty	1
costs	1
more	0
for	0
the	0
bottles	1
than	0
it	0
did	0
for	0
the	0
cokes	1

that	1
was	0
my	0
brother's	1
first	0
job	1
in	0
a	1
grocery	1
store	1
he	1
was	1
in	0
the	0
bottle	1
area	0

we're	0
gonna	0
bump	0
our	1
heads	1

it's	0
pretty	0
dangerous	1
out	1
there	0
you	1
know	0
when	0
they	0
fall	1
over	1
but	0
but	0
it's	1
uh	0
it's	0
quite	1

right	1

they	0
say	1
that	0
the	0
green	1
glass	0
now	1
that	0
there's	0
a	0
big	0
glut	1
of	1
green	1
wi[th]	0
the	0
green	1
glass	0
yeah	1

oh	0
really	1

of	0
green	1
glass	1

yeah	1
it's	0
amazing	1

uh	0
we[ll]	0
out	1
in	0
this	1
area	0
they	1
really	0
don't	0
have	1
anything	0
now	0
i	1
know	0
that	0
like	1
minyard's	1
and	0
places	1
like	0
that	1
around	0
like	1
arlington	1
and	1
fort	1
worth	1
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
those	1
grocery	1
stores	0
they	1
have	1
like	1
four	1
different	1
bins	1
out	0
front	1
yeah	0
different	0
colors	1
for	0
different	0
things	1
and	0
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

right	1

but	0
i	0
i	1
did	1
know	0
some	1
of	0
these	0
places	0
were	0
doing	1
that	0
and	0
they	0
discontinued	1
them_1	0
because	1
people	1
coming	0
and	0
dumping	0
their	0
trash	1
in	0
them_1	0

right	1

yeah	1
it's	1
i	0
notice	1
the	1
plastics	1
have	1
sort	1
of	0
faded	1
away	1
the	0
milk	1
jugs	1

yeah	1

it	0
it's	0
people	1
just	0
they	1
they	0
really	1
don't	1
uh	0
there's	0
too	1
much	0
labor	1
involved	0
i	0
guess	1
to	0
separate	1
the	0
stuff	0

yeah	1
more	1
than	0
it's	0
worth	1

it's	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
it	1
it	1
can	0
be	0
it's	0
not	1
as	0
easy	1
collecting	1
you	1
know	0
clean	1
junk	1
as	0
they	0
say	1

right	1
righ[t]	1
well	0
who	1
wants	0
to	0
clean	0
their	0
junk	1
before	0
they	0
throw	1
it	0
away	0

that's	1
right	1
that's	0
right	1
it's	0
like	0
washing	1
the	0
dishes	1
before	0
you	0
put	0
them_1	0
in	1
the	0
dishwasher	1

thank	1
you	0

thank	1
you	1

bye	0
bye	1

bye	1

okay	1
um	1
yeah	1
one	1
year	1
public	1
service	1
for	1
everybody	1
is	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
it	1
right	1

right	1
uh	1
who	1
wants	0
to	1
start	1
this	1
one	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
i've	1
been	0
i've	0
been	1
sitting	1
here	1
thinking	1
here	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
you	1
know	1
took	1
a	1
couple	1
tries	1
before	1
i	1
found	1
somebody	1
well	1
you	1
know	0
i'm	0
like	1
i'm	0
not	1
really	1
sure	1
what	1
i	0
think	0
about	0
this	1
um	1
uh	0
i	1
mean	1
the	0
first	1
thing	0
is	0
the	1
oh	0
if	1
it's	0
going	1
to	0
be	1
mandatory	1
it's	1
got	1
to	1
be	1
mandatory	1
i	0
mean	1
everybody	1
not	1
just	1
like	0
you	1
know	0
poor	1
people	0
and	0
all	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
but	1
you	0
know	0
senators'	1
sons	1
and	0
all	1
that	1
stuff	0
too	1
i	0

right	1
right	1

i	0
mean	0
everybody's	1
got	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
um	0
i	1
don't	1
know	1
it'd	1
probably	1
be	1
it'd	1
probably	1
be	1
good	1
i	0
just	1
don't	1
know	1
if	1
you	1
know	0
if	1
i	1
was	0
eighteen	1
or	1
whatever	0
i'd	1
want	1
to	0
be	1
stuck	1
doing	1
it	0
for	0
a	0
year	0
or	0
whatever	1

i'm	1
not	1
sure	1
i	1
want	1
an	1
eighteen	1
year	1
old	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
decision	1
uh	1
i	1
mean	1
uh	1
that	0
that	1
doesn't	0
sound	1
right	1
um	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
see	1
overall	1
beneficial	1
if	0
we're	0
if	1
we're	0
just	1
going	0
from	0
that	1
point	0
of	1
view	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
i	0
you	1
know	0
in	0
the	1
past	1
i	1
don't	1
know	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
how	1
old	1
you	1
are	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
uh	1
in	1
high	1
school	1
was	1
uh	1
beginning	1
of	1
vietnam	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
peers	1
were	0
being	0
drafted	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	0
many	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
conscientious	1
objections	1
to	1
war	1
or	1
whatever	1
but	1
i	1
i	1
felt	1
strongly	1
then	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
they	0
didn't	1
feel	1
like	1
they	1
could	0
kill	1
someone	1
or	1
go	1
into	1
a	1
military	1
situation	1
that	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
help	1
the	1
country	1
in	0
other	1
ways	1
be	1
it	1
cleaning	0
out	1
uh	0
lots	1
in	0
in	1
their	0
neighborhood	1
or	0
whatever	1
kind	0
of	0
community	1
or	0
public	1
service	1
might	0
be	0
available	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
as	0
not	1
so	0
much	1
a	1
a	0
demand	1
but	0
but	0
a	0
privilege	1
it's	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	1
uh	1
uh	0
it's	0
something	1
i[t's]	0

yeah	1
is	0
um	0

it's	1
since	1
since	1
we	0
live	1
here	0
and	0
we	0
all	1
benefit	1
rich	1
poor	1
or	1
in	1
between	1
uh	0
there	0
are	1
benefits	0
even	0
for	0
those	0
who	0
have	1
it	0
the	0
hardest	1
i	0
just	1
see	0
that	1
as	0
maybe	1
a	0
good	0
idea	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
mind	0
doing	1
it	0
at	1
forty	0
four	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
find	1
ways	1
to	0
to	0
turn	1
some	0
of	0
that	0
back	1
to	0
to	0
others	1
uh	0
and	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	0
can't	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
being	1
something	0
to	0
really	1
object	1
to	1

well	1
i	1
guess	1
it's	1
going	1
to	0
depend	1
on	0
how	1
i	1
mean	1
if	1
if	1
you're	1
talking	1
about	1
any	1
if	1
you're	1
talking	1
about	1
something	1
that's	0
like	0
a	1
full	1
time	1
you	0
know	1
one	1
year	1
full	1
time	1
you	1
know	0
this	1
is	0
what	0
you	1
do	1
you	1
know	0
you're	1
going	1
to	0
go	1
and	0
and	1
fill	1
pot	1
holes	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
all	0
that	1
stuff	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1

i	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
a	1
full	1
a	1
run	1
a	1
gamut	1
of	1
different	0
kinds	1
of	1
opportunities	1
things	1
that	1
need	1
to	0
be	1
done	1
that	1
wou[ld]	0
that	0
could	0
be	1
done	0
in	0
an	0
hour	1
or	0
two	1
uh	1
a	1
day	1
or	0
several	0
hours	1
of	0
the	0
week	0
like	0
a	0
half	1
of	0
a	0
day	0
on	0
saturday	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	0
in	0
addition	1
to	0
what	0
one	0
does	1
uh	0
besides	1
that	0

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
i	0
can't	1
imagine	1
what	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	0
uh	0
bureaucracies	1
we'd	0
get	0
into	1
and	0
expense	1
having	1
it	0
be	0
full	1
time	1
oh	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
this	0
camp	1
and	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
like	1
um	0
back	0
in	0
the	0
depression	1
the	0
ccc	1
the	0
the	0
construction	1
corps	1
that	0
went	1
out	0
and	0
did	1
things	0
that	1
was	0
great	1
it	0

yeah	1

it	0
was	0
needed	1
it	0
gave	1
folks	1
some	0
jobs	1
and	0
we	1
got	0
some	0
great	1
public	0
works	1
out	0
of	0
it	0
but	1
um	1
i	1
don't	0
see	0
that	1
as	0
being	0
necessary	1
now	0
i	1
can	0
see	1
it	0
being	0
done	1
uh	0
on	0
a	0
regular	1
schedule	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
everybody	1
has	0
to	0
put	0
in	0
so	1
many	0
hours	1
of	0
uh	0
public	1
service	1
in	0
a	0
given	0
time	1
perhaps	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
i	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
see	0
all	1
of	0
us	0
benefiting	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
don't	1
see	0
it	0
just	0
relegated	1
to	0
the	0
young	1
but	0
i	0
see	1
i	0
i	0
see	1
so	0
much	0
going	0
on	1
that	0
that's	0
bad	1
and	0
this	1
would	0
give	0
them	0
a	0
chance	1
to	0
have	1
some	0
positive	1
self	1
esteem	1
something	0

uh-huh	1

something	0
that	0
they	0
turn	1
back	1

well	0

and	0
also	1
you	0
know	0
you	1
you	0
you	0
feel	1
more	1
like	0
you	0
know	0
you're	1
actually	0
part	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
if	0
you've	0
done	1
something	0
in	0
it	0

that's	0
right	1

you	0
take	1
pride	1
in	0
that	1
and	0
and	0
get	1
some	0
some	0
positive	1
feedback	1
from	0
those	1
who	0
benefit	0
besides	1
yourself	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	1
i	1
see	1
it	0
being	0
most	1
beneficial	1
if	0
it's	0
in	0
the	0
neighborhood	1
where	0
or	0
or	0
at	0
least	1
the	0
area	1
where	0
the	0
person	0
lives	1
it	0

uh	0
definitely	1

it	0
may	1
not	0
be	0
the	0
same	1
neighborhood	1
but	0
the	0
same	1
city	1
or	0
county	1
because	1
then	1
you're	0
you're	0
coming	1
in	0
contact	1
with	0
it	0
it's	0
not	1
as	0
meaningful	1
for	0
me	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
minnesota	1
and	0
do	0
something	0
up	0
there	0
that	0
i'll	0
never	1
be	0
able	0
to	0
see	1
again	0
unless	1
i	0
happen	0
to	0
go	0
on	0
vacation	1
up	1
there	0

right	1

yeah	1

it's	0
so	0
it	0
almost	1
needs	0
to	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
has	1
more	1
impact	1
for	0
the	0
individual	1
on	1
going	1

yeah	1

but	0
as	1
far	1
as	0
putting	1
that	0
into	0
work	1
i	1
don't	1
want	1
to	0
i	1
don't	0
want	0
to	0
deal	1
with	0
the	0
with	1
the	0
heartache	1
of	0
first	1
of	0
all	1
getting	1
it	0
started	1
and	1
figuring	0
out	0
how	1
to	1
do	0
the	0
logistics	1
yeah	0

oh	1
uh	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
nightmare	1

and	1
just	0
i	1
mean	1
just	1
getting	1
getting	1
it	1
going	1

yeah	0

yeah	0

i	0
i	0
see	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
things	0
like	0
uh	0
scouting	1
uh	0
boys	1
clubs	0
girls	1
clubs	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
that	0
kind	1
of	0
get	1
into	0
that	0
citizenship	1
uh	0
the	0
uh	0
looking	1
after	0
the	0
environment	1
sort	1
of	0
thing	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
don't	1
see	0
uh	0
this	1
being	1
that	0
different	1
but	0
even	1
more	0
beneficial	1
because	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
everybody	1
participated	1
in	0
and	0
would	0
take	1
a	0
turn	1
in	0

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	1
have	1
kids	1

n[o]	0
uh	0
no	1
not	0
yet	0
about_1	0
six	1
months	1
we	0
will	0

oh	1
well	0
good	1
good	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
little	0
time	1
think	0
about	0
that	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	1
have	0
uh	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
teaching	1
school	0
i	0
saw	1
many	0
ki[ds]	0
so	0
many	0
kids	1
that	0
were	0
at	0
loose	0
ends	1
and	1
that	0
didn't	1
really	0
have	1
a	0
purpose	1
and	0
i	0
can	0
see	1
you	1
know	0
some	0
some	0
really	1
significant	1
things	1
coming	0
out	0
of	0
it	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
know	1
you've	0
got	1
to	0
get	0
past	1
that	1
that	0
grudge	1
attitude	0
that	0
many	0
have	1
but	0
that's	1
uh	0
tha[t]	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
part	1
of	0
selling	1
it	0
to	0
the	0
community	1
to	0

uh-huh	1

the	0
adults	1
ahead	1
of	0
them	0
that	0
probably	0
would	0
never	1
serve	1
and	0
and	0
to	0
each	1
succeeding	0
generation	1
there'd	0
definitely	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
major	1
pr	1
campaign	1
in	0
each	0
community	0
each	0
county	1
uh	0
parish	1
or	0
however	1
the	0
state	1
was	0
divided	0
up	1

uh-huh	1

hum	1
i	0
may	0
well	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
around	1
here	1
we	0
have	0
a	0
number	1
of	0
community	0
projects	1
that	0
folks	0
just	0
volunteer	1
for	1
boy	0
scout	1
troops	1
or	0
church	1
groups	1
or	0
civic	1
clubs	1
will	0
uh	0
police	1
a	0
uh	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
miles	1
of	0
the	0
highway	1
and	1
kee[p]	0
and	1
i	0
i've	0
seen	1
it	0
in	0
other	0
states	1
too	1
i	1

yeah	1
they	0
have	0
that	0
here	1
um	0

i	1
don't	0
know	0

um	1

they've	0
got	1
um	0
in	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
states	1
around	0
here	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
you	0
know	0
down	1
in	0
north	0
carolina	1
there	0
was	0
a	0
big	0
controversy	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
because_1	0
the	0
uh	1
the	0
local	1
chapter	0
of	0
the	0
kkk	1
wanted	0
to	0
uh	0
um	0
to	0
participate	1
in	0
it	0
and	0

and	0
uh	0
there	0
was	0
a	0

and	0
there	0
were	0
those	1
that	0
said	0
no	1
you	0
can't	1
do	1
that	0
i'm	0
sure	1

yeah	1
well	1
uh	0
it	0
was	0
it	0
was	0
interesting	1
because	1
that's	0
an	0
interesting	0
question	1
you	0
know	1
should	1

yeah	0

should	1
these	0
people	0
be	0
allowed	1
to	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
think	1
they	0
finally	1
decided	0
not	1
to	0
because	0
they	0
figured	1
that	1
stretch	1
of	0
highway	1
was	0
going	1
to	1
get	0
trashed	1

oh	1
and	0
i	0
hadn't	1
even	0
thought	1
about	0
that	0
uh	0
the	0
oth[er]	1
the	0
other	0
end	1
of	0
that	0
that	1
that's	1
an	0
interesting	1
uh	0
situation	1
i	0
hadn't	0
thought	1
of	0
that	0
we	1
had	0
visited	1
relatives	1
in	0
virginia	1
not	0
too	0
long	1
ago	0
and	1
i	0
thought	1
i	0
had	0
seen	1
when	0
we	0
were	0
traveling	1
around	0
the	0
state	1
some	0
similar	1
signs	1
up	0
that	0
indicated	1
that	0
certain	0
sections	1
were	0
being	0
policed	1
and	0
cleaned	0
up	1
and	0

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
virginia's	1
got	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
know	1
maryland	1
does	0
and	0
we	1
just	0
we	0
went	1
to	0
indianapolis	1
last	0
weekend	0
and	0
back	1
and	0
um	0
i'm	0
pretty	1
sure	0
i	0
saw	1
yeah	0
stuff	0
in	0
ohio	1
and	0
indi[ana]	0
indiana	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
pennsylvania	1
maybe	1
pennsylvania	1
i	0
don't	0
remember	0
for	0
sure	1
now	0

and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
about	0
your	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1
but	0
uh	1
down	0
here	1
in	0
the	0
last	1
y[ear]	0
oh	0
year	1
plus	1
i	0
it	0
was	0
las[t]	1
beginning	1
with	0
last	1
year's	0
earth	1
day	1
there's	0
just	1
been	0
more	1
of	0
a	0
turn	1
toward	1
uh	0
environmental	1
concerns	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
e[ven]	0
i	1
work	0
for	0
texas	0
instruments	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
they	0
they've	0
started	1
some	0
recycling	1
campaigns	1
that	0
a	0
year	1
before	0
that	1
had	0
been	0
turned	1
down	1
because_1	0
they	0
said	0
well	1
it's	0
not	1
feasible	1
it's	0

uh-huh	1

it's	0
not	1
a	0
good	0
idea	0
and	1
i	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
being	0
i	1
i	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
being	0
a	0
a	0
a	0
change	1
um	0
it	0
for	0
the	0
positive	1
kind	1
of	0
along	0
the	0
same	1
line	0
as	0
as	0
as	0
the	0
mandatory	1
thing	0
it's	0

yeah	1
and	0
but	0
then	1
they	0
lost	1
too	0
much	0
business	1

it's	0
just	0
thing	1
a	0
part	1
of	0
everyone's	0
consciousness	1

uh-huh	1
well	1
the	0
thing	1
about	0
that	1
is	0
though	0
it's	0
got	1
a	0
i	0
mean	1
because	0
it	0
was	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
was	0
big	1
you	0
remember	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
early	0
seventies	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
just	0
went	1
out	0
of	0
vogue	1
and	1
i	0
i'm	0
worried	1
that	0
it	0
it	1
might	0
you	0
know	0
it'll	0
it	1
the	0
same	1
thing	0
will	0
happen	1
it's	0
like	0
you	0
know	1
environmentalism	1
was	1
really	0
big	1
for	0
a	1
couple	1
of	0
years	1
and	0
then	0
people	0
like	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
i'd	0
rather	1
rather	0
spend	1
you	0
know	0
fifty	1
cents	1
less	1
on	1
uh	0
on	0
on	1
such	1
and	0
such	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
even	1
if	1
it's	0
not	0
environmentally	0
safe	1
who	1
cares	1
you	1
know	0

i'm	0
sure	1
the	0
pendulum	1
will	0
swing	0
the	0
other	0
way	1
uh	0
there	0
have	0
been	0
too	1
many	0
other	1
things	0
that	0
it's	0
done	1
that	0
for	0
just	0
in	0
my	1
life	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
look	1
at	0
history	1
at	0
all	1
you	0
see	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
we	1
go	0
from	0
one	1
side	0
to	0
the	0
other	1
on	0
just	0
about	0
any	1
subject	1
that	0
you	0
one	1
might	0
care	1
to	0
bring	0
up	1

yeah	0

but	1
it	0
is	1
comforting	1
to	0
me	0
to	0
see	1
uh	0
more	1
concern	1
about	0
some	0
of	0
these	0
things	0
that	0
that	0
cost	1
us	0
money	1
especially	1
when	0
we	0
have	0
dwindling	1
uh	0
resources	1
such	1
as	0
oil	1
that's	0
burning	1
out	1
of	0
control	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
persian	1
gulf	1
and	0
and	0
so	1
forth	0
just	0
just	0
every	1
little	0
bit	1
does	1
it	0
makes	1
me	0
feel	1
better	0
it	0
it	0
makes	1
me	0
feel	1
like	0
well	1
there	0
may	1
be	0
something	0
left	1
for	0
my	1
children	0
my	0
nieces	1
and	0
nephews	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0

well	0
yeah	1
uh	0
uh	1
well	0
wouldn't	0
it's	0
just	0
probably	1
a	0
good	0
thing	0
that	0
the	0
oil's	1
burning	1
and	0
may	0
may	1
make	0
some	0
people	0
realize	1
that	0
hey	1
you	0
know	0
this	0
stuff	0
runs	0
out	1

that's	0
that's	0
right	1
because	1

of	0
course	1
that's	0
probably	1
blasphemy	1
for	0
you	0
to	0
say	1
uh	0
coming	1
from	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
texas	1

uh	0
no	1
no	1
because	1
if	0
we	1
what	1
was	0
it	0
in	0
seventy	1
four	1
when	0
we	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
last	0
last	1
oil	1
crisis	1
an[d]	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
started	1
getting	0
smart	1
and	0
and	0
we	0
were	0
looking	1
all	0
these	0
alternative	1
sources	1
of	0
energy	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
as	0
soon	1
as	0
the	0
oil	1
prices	0
came	0
back	0
down	1
we	0
the	0
pendulum	1
swung	1
the	0
other	1
way	1

right	1

and	1
we	1
need	1
those	1
reminders	1

yeah	1

uh	0
or	1
we'll	0
suddenly	1
be	0
in	0
the	0
dark	1
and	0
say	0
oh	1
my	0
goodness	1
now	1
we	0
don't	0
have	1
the	0
ability	1
to	0
go	0
on	1
to	0
some	0
new	1
technology	0

right	1
well	0
my	0
dad's	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
solar	1
energy	0
business	1
so	1
um	0
you	0
know	0
we're	1
acutely	1
aware	1
of	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
this	0
but	1

ah	1

but	1
you	0
know	0
on	0
the	0
other	1
hand	0
he	0
voted	1
for	0
george	0
bush	1
so	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
wonder	1
sometimes	1
if	0
he	1
knows	0
what	0
he's	0
doing	1

well	1
i	0
thi[s]	0
you	0
know	0
just	1
about	0
anybody	1
you	0
could	0
name	1
whether	0
i	1
voted	0
for	0
them	0
or	0
not	1
uh	0
makes	1
um	0
uh	0
decisions	1
that	0
i	0
just	0
can't	1
go	0
along	0
with	0

uh-huh	1

but	1
uh	0
that's	1
why	0
they're	1
there	0
and	0
not	1
me	0
i	1
don't	0
want	0
the	0
i	1
don't	0
want	0
the	0
stress	1
and	0

yeah	1

well	1
the	1
the	0
thing	1
with	1
bush	1

okay	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it	1

well	1
uh	1
the	1
roles	1
have	1
definitely	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
generation	1
or	1
so	1

oh	1
yeah	1

um	1
i	1
i	1
think	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
women	1
working	1

uh-huh	1
yeah	1
i	1
do	1
too	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
going	0
to	1
in	1
like	1
in	1
the	0
future	1
i	0
think	1
all	1
women	1
are	1
going	0
to	1
work	1

yeah	1

i	1
mean	1
they	0
may	1
let	0
you	1
off	1
for	0
a	1
day	1
or	0
two	1
to	0
have	1
your	0
baby	1
but	1
that	0
will	0
be	0
it	1

yeah	0

or	1
either	0
they'll	0
have	1
a	1
computer	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
in	0
the	1
hospital	1
where	1
you	0
can	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
just	0
continue	1
right	0
on	1
with	0
your	0
work	1

ye[ah]	0
yeah	1

i	1
mean	1
i[t]	0
it	1
really	1
is	1
coming	1
to	0
that	1
because	0
most	1
women	1
now	1
days	1
cannot	1
afford	1
the	0
time	1
that	1
they	1
could	0
take	0
off	1
unless	1
the	1
company	0
pays	1
them	1

right	1
right	1

they	1
can't	1
even	0
afford	1
to	0
take	1
off	1
you	1
know	1
to	0
have	0
children	1
it	1
seems	1
like	0

and	1
it	0
and	0
it	0
seems	1
if	1
you're	0
going	1
to	0
have	0
kids	1
uh	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
know	0
society	1
has	1
decided	1
for	1
you	1
how	1
many	1
you	1
can	1
really	1
have	0
and	1
make	1
it	0

yeah	1

and	1
uh	1
because	1
if	0
you	0
have	1
you	1
know	0
two	1
well	1
if	0
you	1
go	1
to	0
work	1
you're	1
just	0
working	1
to	1
pay	1
for	0
day	1
care	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
you	0
know	1
um	0

right	1

now	0
i	1
was	0
real	1
lucky	1
because	1
my	0
husband	1
had	0
a	1
good	0
enough	1
job	1
where	0
when	0
my	1
kids	1
were	0
you	0
know	0
when	1
i	0
had	1
them	1
and	0
when	0
they	0
were	1
small	1
until	0
they	1
got	0
in	1
junior	1
high	1
school	0
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
got	1
in	0
junior	1
high	1
i	1
didn't	1
have	1
to	0
work	1

uh-huh	1

oh	1
that	0
is	1
good	1

i	1
mean	0
i	0
didn't	1
work	1
i	1
i	1
needed	1
to	1
but	1
i	1
didn't	1

yeah	0
steve's	1
steve	1
has	0
a	0
sister	1
who	0
has	0
four	1
she	0
just	0
had	1
her	0
fourth	1
one	1
in	1
uh	0
march	1
and	1
she	1
doesn't	0
have	0
to	1
work	1
either	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
they	0
do	1
it	0
i	1
don['t]	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
people	1
do	0
it	0
with	0
one	1
you	1
know	1
um	1
obviously	0

let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	0
you	0
go	1
without	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
wou[ld]	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
obviously	1
we	1
don't	1
have	1
any	1
and	1
and	0
i	1
don't	0
i	1
think	1
that's	0
part	1
of	1
the	0
role	0
reversal	1
is	1
it's	0
okay	1
to	0
get	1
married	1
and	1
not	1
have	0
kids	1

oh	1
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
think	1
for	0
society	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
said	0
well	1
you	0
know	1
you're	1
married	1
now	1
you	1
need	0
to	1
se[t]	1
have	0
have	1
your	0
family	1
and	1
i	0
don't	1
think	1
it's	0
been	0
until	1
recently	1
that	0
that	0
they	1
had	1
decided	1
that	0
two	1
people	1
was	1
a	1
family	0

right	1
right	0

you	0
know	0
and	0

well	1
it's	1
getting	1
where	1
you	1
can't	1
hardly	0
afford	1
if	0
you're	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
your	0
kids	1
any	0
kind	1
of	1
education	1
and	0
stuff	0
you	1
can't	0
hardly	0
afford	1
to	0
have	1
over	1
two	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
mean	0
it's	1
hard	1
with	1
two	1
now	1
we	1
uh	1
my	1
youngest	1
one	0
i	1
have	0
two	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
son	1
and	0
a	0
daughter	1
and	1
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
graduating	1
from	0
college	1
soon	1

oh	1

but	0
if	0
i	1
had	0
a	0
third	1
one	0
i	1
just	0
don't	0
know	0
where	1
it	0
would	0
come	1
from	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

because	1
i	1
work	0
now	1
i	0
work	1
full	0
time	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
it	0
when	0
you	1
put	0
them	0
through	0
college	1
it	0
just	0
takes	1
just	0
about	0
everything	1
you	0
got	1

yeah	1

they	0
get	0
loans	1
and	0
grants	1
and	0
scholarships	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
that	0
helps	0
out	1
but	0
still	1
it	0
cost	1
a	1
lot	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
mean	0
just	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
cost	1
of	0
living	1
and	0
loans	1
don't	0
pay	1
for	0
groceries	1
and	0
stuff	1

right	1
and	0
cars	1
and	0
all	1
their	0
books	1
and	0
the	0
books	1
are	0
outrageous	1
i	0
mean	1
absolutely	1
outrageous	1
and	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0

and	1
they're	0
getting	0
worse	1
uh	1
my	0
daughter	1
brought	1
home	1
a	0
book	1
the	1
other	0
day	1
that	0
she	1
was	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
for	0
her	0
one	1
of	0
her	0
next	0
classes	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
like	1
ninety	1
six	0
dollars	1
and	0

jeez	0

and	0
this	1
book	1
is	0
a	0
little	1
bitty	0
skinny	1
book	1

yeah	0

i	1
said	0
my	0
goodness	1
what	0
is	1
it	0
lined	1
in	0
gold	1
you	1
know	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
it	0
is	1
it's	0
getting	0
worse	1
and	0
if	0
i'd	1
of	0
probably	0
had	1
three	1
or	0
four	0
children	1
i	0
don't	0
see	1
how	0
we	0
could	0
have	0
made	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
without	1
me	0
working	0

but	0
that's	1
that's	1
probably	1
because	0
you	1
know	0
if	1
you	1
had	1
three	1
you	1
you	1
know	0
would	1
say	0
if	1
i'd	1
of	0
had	0
four	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
always	1
not	1
not	1
being	0
able	0
to	0
picture	1
one	1
more	1
but	0
in	0
essence	1
you	0
probably	1
would	0
have	0
worked	1
out	0
fine	1

right	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	0
to	0
work	1

yeah	1

if	1
i'd	1
of	1
had	0
that	1
many	1
i'd	0
of	0
had	1
to	0
work	1
in	1
order	1
for	0
my	0
kids	1
to	0
you	0
know	1
even	1
though	0
he	0
brings	1
in	0
a	1
real	1
good	1
living	1
and	1
everything	1
in	0
order	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
keep	0
up	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	1
to	0
work	0

yeah	0

but	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
getting	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
like	1
when	0
you	1
have	0
one	1
child	1
now	1
that's	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
then	1

then	1
you	0
go	0
to	1
work	1
and	0
you	1
work	1

yeah	1

because	1
if	0
you	1
have	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
kids	1
by	0
the	1
way	1
the	0
inflation's	1
going	1
i	1
think	0
a	1
woman's	1
always	1
going	0
to	1
have	0
to	1
work	1
and	0
it's	1
just	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
an	0
accepted	1
thing	1
there	0
isn't	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
any	0
of	0
this	0
you	0
know	0
very	1
few	0
people	1
will	0
ever	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
that's	1
all	1
right	1
with	0
me	1
because	1
i	1
don't	0
want	1
to	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
i	1
think	0
i'm	1
just	0
part	1
of	0
tha[t]	1
the	0
new	1
stuff	1
that	0
is	1
just	1
i	1
don't	0

at	1
home	1
all	1
day	0
long	1

well	0
you	1

it	0
revolutionized	1
