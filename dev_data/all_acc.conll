they	1
will	0
have	1
maybe	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
main	1
stories	1
and	0
just	1
spend	0
a	0
very	1
large	1
amount	0
of	0
time	0

sort	1
of	0
like	0
the	0
uh	0
what	1
is	0
that	0
ABC's	1
Nightline	1

uh	0
well	0
i	1
guess	0
they	0
only	1
normally	0
stick	1
with	0
just	1
the	0
one	1
um	0
story	1

but	0
they	1
they	1
can	1
do	1
a	1
much	1
better	1
job	1
since	0
they	0
don't	1
have	0
to	1
chop	1
it	1
into	0
little	1
two	1
minute	0
stories	1

they	1
don't	0
report	1
on	0
every	0
murder	1
and	0
shooting	1
that	0
happened	1
in	0
in	0
every	1
little	0
town	1

no	1
no	1
it's	0

it's	0
very	1
much	1
national	1
interest	1
news	0

yeah	1

a	0
lot	1
of	1
times	0
they	0
end	0
up	1
um	1
with	0
these	1
panels	1
of	1
experts	1
and	0
they	0
go	0
back	0
and	0
forth	1
where	0
everyone's	0
giving	1
some	0
opinions	1
and	1
sometimes	0
that	1

i	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
the	1
value	1
of	0
that	1
because	1
um	0
i	1
saw	1
plenty	1
of	0
jokes	1
and	0
and	1
um	0
oh	0
editorial	1
cartoons	1
about	0
all	0
the	1
retired	1
generals	1
making	0
their	0
living	1
[laughter-during]	1
the	0
the	1
Gulf	0
War	1

i've	1
been	0
getting	0
a	0
kick	1
out	0
of	0
those	0
lately	1

although	1
um	1
i'm	0
i'm	1
only	0
twenty	0
five	0
so	0

so	0
i've	1
never	0
actually	1
been	0
through	0
a	0
period	0
of	1
war	1

and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
anyone	0
in	0
the	0
military	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
have	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
background	1
knowledge	0
in	0
uh	0
military	0
strategy	1
and	0
and	0
weaponry	1
and	0
and	0
all	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	0
and	0
i	1
thought	1
the	0
generals	0
were	0
very	0
interesting	1
now	0

now	0
when	0
they	0
started	0
to	0
speculate	1
i	0
i	1
saw	1
that	0
for	1
what	0
it	0
was	1
and	0
thought	0
all	1
of	0
these	0
guys	1
don't	0
know	0
what's	0
going	0
on	1
but	0

but	0
i	0
thought	1
they	0
were	0
the[y]	0
they	1
were	0
interesting	0
and	0

and	0
and	0
they	0
shed	1
some	0
light	1
on	0
what	0
was	0
going	0
on	1
for	0
me	1

i	0
will	1
admit	0
it's	0
interesting	0
i	1
i	1
i'm	1
twenty	1
six	0
so	1
i	1
don't	0
have	1
any	0
more	0
experience	1
in	0
that	0
than	0
you	1
um	0
it	0
it	1
it	1
was	1
very	0
interesting	1
that	1
it	0
seemed	1
like	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
commentators	1
had	0
their	0
axe	1
to	1
grind	0
you	0
know	0
there	0
were	0
some	1
that	0
were	0
screaming	1
for	0
air	0
power	1
there	0

there	0
were	0
some	1
that	0
were	0
saying	0
the	0
air	1
power	0
wasn't	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

and	0
they	0
seemed	0
to	0
mold	1
the	0
events	1
to	0
their	0
view	0
of	0
the	0
world	1
which	0
i	0
suppose	0
just	0
about	0
everyone	1
does	0
but	0

but	0
these	0
guys	0
had	0
a	0
a	0
uh	0
national	1
soap	1
box	0
to	0
stand	1
on	0
and	0
and	1
express	1
this	0
view	1

you	1
know	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
best	1
uh	0
television	1
news	1
shows	0
that	0
i	1
saw	0
during	1
the	0
war	0
was	0
a	0
show	1
on	1
a	0
Saturday	1
morning	1
on	0
ABC	1
and	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
for	0
children	1

and	0
it	0
was	0
hosted	1
by	0
Peter	0
Jennings	0
and	0
it	0
was	0
so	1
interesting	1
because	0
they	1
were	0
relating	1
the	1
war	1
to	0
these	0
children	1
in	0
their	0
studio	1
and	0
they	0
also	0
had	0
children	0
calling	0
in	0
live	1
from	1
all	0
over	0
the	0
country	1
and	0
asking	0
questions	1
and	0
they	0
they	0
had	0
all	1
their	0
correspondents	1
in	0
the	1
different	0
areas	1
in	0
Saudi	1
Arabia	1
and	0
Israel	1
and	0
and	1
all	1
they	0
had	1
them	0
all	1
uh	1
on	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
you'd	0
call	1
it	0
other	0
than	0
on	0
line	0
they	0

they	0
had	0
them	0
all	0
on	0
hold	1
and	0

and	0
if	0
a	0
child	1
asked	0
a	0
question	0
that	0
the	0
person	1
in	0
Jerusalem	1
could	0
best	0
answer	1
they	0
would	0
cut	1
to	0
that	0
person	1
and	0
that	0
person	0
would	0
answer	0
the	0
question	1
it	0
was	0
just	0
very	1
informative	1
and	0
interesting	1

and	0
uh	0
i	1
was	0
real	0
impressed	0
at	0
how	0
ABC	1
handled	0
uh	0
translating	1
the	0
war	1
for	0
children	1

um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
i	0
didn't	0
see	1
anything	0
like	0
that	0
although	1
i	0
did	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	0
one	1
thing	0
that	1
i	1
found	0
sort	1
of	1
interesting	1
this	0
is	1
getting	1
a	1
little	1
off	0
the	0
topic	1
but	1

but	1
there	0
there	1
is	0
a	1
a	0
big	1
push	1
you	1
kn[ow]	1
with	0
the	0
local	1
T	0
V	1
stations	1
to	0
have	0
little	0
hot	1
lines	1
with	0
um	0
counselors	1
to	1
to	0
help	1
parents	0
uh	0
learn	0
how	0
to	0
talk	1
about	0
their	0
war	0
with	0
their	0
children	1

i	0

i	0
thought	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
really	0
unusual	1
thing	0

and	1
our	0
local	1
HEB	1
stores	0
here	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
HEB	0
statewide	1
or	0
whatever	0
but	0
they	1
have	0
videos	1
that	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	1
they	0
still	0
have	1
them	0
but	0

but	0
they	0
were	0
free	1
rental	0
videos	1
that	0
had	0
something	1
to	0
do	1
with	0
the	0
war	1

um-hum	0

uh	0

uh	0
it	1
was	0

it	1
was	0
right	1
it	0

it	0
was	0
something	1
for	0
children	1
that	1
that	0
they	0
they	0
had	0
several	1
advertisements	1
on	0
television	1
pushing	0
parents	1
going	0
and	0
and	0
uh	0
getting	1
the	0
video	0
and	0
watching	1
it	0
with	0
their	0
children	0
and	0
discussing	1
it	0
and	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	0

um-hum	0
i	0
suppose	1
that	0
is	1
a	0
valuable	1
service	1
that	0

again	1
not	0
having	1
uh	0
lived	1
through	0
another	0
war	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
that's	1
a	0
common	1
thing	1
that	0
people	0
thought	1
of	0
or	1
if	0
that	1
was	1
a	0
a	0
new	1
concern	1
with	0
people	0

well	1
back	1
during	0
the	0
Vietnam	1
conflict	1
that	0
no	1
one	0
will	0
will	0
have	1
the	0
guts	0
enough	0
to	0
call	0
a	0
real	0
war	1

uh	0

uh	0
the	0
that	0
type	1
of	0
technology	1
just	0
wasn't	1
at	0
people's	0
disposal	1

that's	0
true	1

that's	0
true	1

so	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
there's	0
ever	0
been	1
a	0
war	0
that's	0
been	0
so	0
thoroughly	1
covered	1
by	0
the	0
news	1

and	0
probably	0
more	0
importantly	1
one	0
that	1
lasted	1
short	1
enough	0
that	1
that	0
people's	0
interest	1
didn't	1
flauge	1
too	0
badly	1

yeah	0
i	1
tell	0
you	0
what	1
the	0

the	0
first	1
three	0
days	1
i	1
was	0
glued	1
to	0
the	0
television	1

i	1
will	0
admit	0
the	0
same	0
thing	0
i	0

i	0
would	0
come	0
home	1
and	0
flip	0
on	0
MacNeil	0
Lehrer	1
and	0

and	0
they	0
would	0
run	0
these	0
extended	1
two	1
three	1

hour	0
versions	1
of	0
the	0
program	0

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
i	1
was	0
just	0
i	1
was	0
horrified	1
and	0
[laughter-fascinated]	1
by	0
what	0
i	0
was	0
seeing	1

i	1
tell	0
you	0
what	0
the	0
the	0
uh	0
war	1
start[ed]	0
let's	0
see	0
was	0
it	1
a	1
Wednesday	1
or	0
Thursday	1
must	1
have	1
been	0
Thursday	1
um	0

and	0
Friday	1
night	1
i	1
was	0
i	1
stayed	0
up	1
until	0
two	0
o'clock	0
in	0
the	0
morning	1
sitting	1
right	1
dead	1
center	1
in	0
front	0
of	0
my	0
television	1
just	0
watching	1
practically	1
with	0
my	0
mouth	1
hanging	0
open	0

because	0
i	1
was	1
watching	1
CNN	1
and	0
they	1
would	0
they	0
would	0
switch	1
back	1
to	0
the	0
one	0
of	0
their	0
Israel	0
bureaus	1
and	0
the	0
people	1
would	0
be	0
standing	0
there	0
in	0
gas	1
masks	0
and	0
you'd	0
be	0
hearing	1
the	0
sirens	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
just	0

i	1
was	0
amazed	1

um-hum	1
um-hum	0
i	1
i	0
didn't	0
have	0
that	0
experience	1
i	0

i	0
i	0
don't	0
have	0
cable	1
so	0

so	0

so	0
i	1
i'm	0
pretty	1
much	0
limited	0
to	0
PBS	1
which	0
i	0
thought	0
i	1
thought	0
they	0
did	0
a	0
very	0
good	0
job	0

um	0
i've	1
got	0
one	1
question	1
for	0
you	0
i	1

i	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
take	0
the	0
newspaper	1

um-hum	0

um	0
i	0
i	1
found	0
the	0
newspaper	1
situation	0
in	0
Dallas	1
very	0
interesting	0
we've	0

we've	0
got	0
the	0
one	1
fairly	1
well	0
relatively	1
weaker	0
paper	0
the	0
Times	1
Herald	1
and	0
then	0
the	0
Morning	0
News	1
which	0
has	0
a	0
very	0
strong	0
subscription	1

does	0
San	1
Antonio	0
ha[ve]	0
you	0

you	0
said	0
San	1
Antonio	0
right	1

do	0
you	1
have	0
just	0
one	0
paper	0
or	0

or	0
do	0
you	0
have	0
several	1

no	1
there	1
are	0
two	1
and	0
they're	1
pretty	0
close	0
uh	0
the	0
one	1
that	0
i	0
picked	1
is	0
more	0
similar	0
in	0
format	1
to	0
the	0
newspaper	1

i	1
grew	0
up	0
near	0
Houston	0
and	0

and	0
there	0
are	0
two	1
major	0
newspapers	0
there	0
that	0
run	1
pretty	0
much	0
neck	0
and	0
neck	0

and	0
the	0
one	1
i	0
picked	0
here	1
had	0
the	0
same	0
format	1
as	0
the	0
one	1
that	0
my	0
parents	1
took	0
as	0
i	0
was	0
growing	0
up	0
i	0
mean	0
the	0
same	1
type	1
of	0
typeface	1
on	0
the	0
headline	1
and	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
stuff	0
i	0

i	0
mean	0

it's	1
piddley	1
stuff	0
to	0
pick	0
a	0
newspaper	1
over	1
and	0
i	1
enjoy	0

the	0
comics	1
are	0
better	0
in	0
this	0
newspaper	0
like	0
this	1
newspaper	0
has	0
The	0
Far	0
Side	1
and	0
some	0
other	0
comics	1
that	0
i	0
enjoy	1
and	0
the	0
other	0
one	0
has	0
some	0
weird	1
ones	0
that	0
i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0

so	0

i	1
i	1
actually	0
take	0
both	1
newspapers	0
on	0
the	0
weekends	1
i	0

i	0
figure	0
i'm	0
only	0
taking	1
on	0
the	0
weekend	1
and	0

and	0
i	0
can	0
afford	1
that	0

yeah	1

i	0
i	0
find	1
the	0
news	1
reporting	0
in	0
the	0
the	0
Mourning	1
News	1
to	0
be	0
better	1
but	0
i	0
i	1
sort	0
of	0
have	0
a	0
liberal	1
political	1
slant	0
and	1

and	1
the	0
Mourning	1
News	0
just	0
has	1
an	0
incredibly	1
conservative	1
editorial	1
um	0
outlook	1

still	0
i	0
i	0

i	0
get	0
the	0
Times	1
Herald	1
just	0
to	0
balance	1
that	0
out	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0

He	1
takes	0
both	1
San	0
Antonio	0
papers	0
an	0
Austin	1
paper	0
both	1
Houston	0
papers	1
i	0
guess	1
he	0
takes	0
seven	1
the	0
San	0
Marcos	1
paper	0
and	0
the	0
New	0
Braunsfel	1
paper	0
but	0
he's	1
a	0
football	1
coach	0
at	0
Southwest	0
Texas	0
State	0
University	1
so	0

so	0
he's	1
getting	0
all	0
the	0
sports	1
sections	0

and	0

and	0
so	1
you	1
know	0
he	0
has	0
these	0
stacks	1
of	0
Sunday	0
newspapers	0
that	0
go	0
unread	1
unless	0

okay	1

okay	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	0
supposed	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
recording	1
but	1
anyway	1
um	1
well	1
i	0
i	0
do	1
take	1
care	0
of	0
pretty	0
much	0
[laughter-all]	1
of	1
the	1
stuff	1
for	1
for	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
um	0
i	1
embarrassed	1
to	1
say	0
it's	1
pretty	1
trivial	1

um-hum	0

all	1
we	1
all	1
i	1
do	1
is	1
uh	1
keep	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
things	1
like	1
debts	1
that	1
are	1
outstanding	1
and	0
and	1
every	1
two	1
or	0
three	1
months	0
update	1
that	1
and	0
every	1
once	1
in	0
a	1
while	1
make	0
a	0
list	1
of	1
what	0
we	1
spent	1
that	1
month	1
but	1
i	1
doubt	1
i	1
do	0
it	1
more	1
than	0
three	1
times	1
a	0
year	1

um-hum	0
do	1
you	0
use	1
a	1
computer	1

and	1

no	1
i	0
work	1
with	0
them_1	0
all	0
day	0
yeah	0
i'm	0
in	1
computer	0
science	1
yet	0
i	0
i	0
do	0
everything	0
on	1
paper	1

oh	0

uh-huh	1

uh	1
i	1
don't	1
even	1
use	0
a	1
calculator	1
for	1
the	1
stuff	0
i'm	1
doing	1
because_1	1
it's	1
all	1
pretty	0
round	1
numbers	0

yeah	1
mine	1
is	0
really	0
simple	1
because	0
i	1
got	0
all	1
our	0
bills	0
paid	0
off	1
when	1
um	1
he	1
was	1
a	0
Marine	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Saudi	1
Arabia	1
and	1
while	0
he	1
was	0
gone	1
i	1
got	0
all	1
of	0
our	1
bills	1
paid	1
off	1
so	1
really	1
the	1
only	1
bills	1
i	1
have	1
is	1
rent	1
utilities	1
insurance	1
you	1
know	1
so	1

um-hum	0

so	1
they	0
come	1
in	1
i	1
pay	1
them_1	0
and	1
that's	0
it	1
[laughter-you]	1
[laughter-know]	0
that's	0
about	1
the	0
extent	1
of	1
it	0
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
i	0

i	1
don't	1
really	1
have	1
this	1
major	1
budget	1
or	0
anything	1
i	1
just	1
really	0
i'm	1
real	1
thrifty	1
i	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
two	0
children	1
and	0
me	1
and	1
um	1
just	1
real	0
careful	1
with	0
the	1
money	1
you	1
know	0
what	0
little	0
we	0
have	1

um-hum	1

so	1
that's	1
what	0
i	1
do	1

yeah	1
it's	1
a	1
pretty	1
straightforward	1
it's	1
almo[st]	1
i	0
can't	1
imagine	0
having	0
to	1
go	0
into	0
real	1
complicated	1
stuff	0
and	1
making	1
you	0
know	1
fancy	1
budgets	1
it	1

no	1

it	1
seems	1
like	1
if	0
you're	0
getting	1
to	0
that	1
level	0
y[ou're]	0
you're	0
not	1
in	0
real	0
good	1
control	1

huh-uh	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
mean	1
i	0
i	0
i've	0
never	1
liked	1
credit	0
cards	0
and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
debt	1
you	1
know	0
you	0

uh-huh	0

you	0
buy	1
something	0
on	0
credit	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
you	0
pay	0
twice	0
as	0
much	1
for	0
it	0
when	0
you	0
get	0
done	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

so	1

actually	1
i'm	0
i	0
me[an]	1
i	0
like	1
using	1
credit	0
cards	0
for	0
everything	1
but	1
just	0
paying	0
off	0
the	1
bills	1
because	1
that	1
way	0
it's	1
a	0
record	1
of	1
everything	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	0
don't	1
have	0
to	0
worry	1
about	1
keeping	1
[laughter-records]	1
of	0
anything	1
else	1
because	1
they	0
come	1
in	0
at	0
the	1
end	0
of	0
the	0
month	1

i	0
don't	1
have	0
too	1
many	0
wea[knesses]	0
i	0
don't	1
have	1
too	0
many	1
weaknesses	1
but	1

but	1
i	1
found	0
out	0
a	1
credit	1
card	0
was	0
one	1
of	1
them_1	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0

uh	0

it's	0
so	1
much	1
easy	0
easier	1
you	1
know	1
if	0
something's	1
on	0
sale	1
if	1
you're	0
a	1
woman	1
and	0
you're	0
a	1
sale	1
person	0
it's	1

it's	1
like	0
oh	1
well	1
that's	0
on	0
sale	1
let's	1
go	0
grab	1
it	0
you	1
know	1
so	1
um	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
money	1
then	0
use	0
the	0
credit	1
card	0
so	1
i	1
got	0
rid	1
of	0
them	0
credit	1
cards	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
that's	0
if	0
that's	0
a	0
weakness	1
that's	0
a	0
good	0
thing	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	1
that	1
was	0
my	0
weakness	1
it	1
wasn't	1
bad	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
didn't	1
have	1
like	1
thousands	1
of	0
dollars	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
like	0
that	1
just	0
i	1
just	0
learned	1
that	0
that	1
wasn't	0
for	0
me	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	1

sure	1

so	1
but	0
i	1
self	1
employed	1
you	0
know	0
i	1
have	1
my	0
own	1
little	1
cleaning	1
business	1
type	1
thing	1
so	0
um	1
i	0
keep	0

do	0
you	0
find	0
trouble	1
keeping	0
the	0
records	0
for	0
taxes	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
or	0

no	1
it's	0
not	0
hard	1
i	0
just	1
keep	0
it	0
in	0
a	0
notebook	1
and	0
write	1
down	0
what	1
i've	0
made	1
and	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
what	1
it's	0
gonna	0
have	0
to	1
go	1
for	1
that	0
month	1
and	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0
not	1
that	0
not	0
that	0
hard	1
not	1
at	0
all	1

uh-huh	0

well	0
that's	1
good	0
to	0
know	1

so	1
i	1
always	0
do	1
my	0
own	0
income	1
tax	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	1

i	0
don't	1
understand	0
the	0
idea	0
of	0
paying	1
somebody	0
to	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

huh	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
it's	0
absurd	1
the	0
number	1
of	0
people	0
who	0
had	0
to	0
having	0
to	0
pay	1
somebody	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

rea[d]	0
all	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
read	1
a	0
book	1
i	1
mean	0
read	1
the	0
little	0
book	1
they	0
send	0
you	0
fill	1
in	0
the	1
blanks	1
and	0
go	1

i	0

yeah	1
just	0
the	0
form	1

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
it	0
seems	1
absurd	1
that	1
people	0
will	1
pay	1
you	0
know	1
some	0
bucks	1
just	1
to	0
get	0
someone	1
to	0

yeah	0
and	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
them_1	0

it's	0
dumb	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
had	0
some	0
really	1
complicated	0
stuff	1
but	0
i	1
don't	0
so	0
i	1
don't	0
mess	1
with	0
it	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
don't	0
use	0
a	1
calculator	1
either	1
[laughter-you]	1
[laughter-know]	1
i	1

i	0
i	1
don't	0
trust	0
myself	1
with	0
using	0
a	0
calculator	1
or	1
computer	1
to	0
too	1
much	0
stuff	0
like	1
that	0
because	0
i	1
wanna	0
make	1
sure	0
that	1
that	0
i	1
i	1
keep	0
on	0
top	1
of	0
the	0
numbers	0
and	0
understand	1
what's	0
going	0
on	1
i	0

i	1
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
have	1
that	0
mu[ch]	1
that	1
many	0
you	1
know	1
things	1
to	0
add	0
up	1
so	1

i	0
know	0
too	1
many	0
people	0
who	0
use	0
a	1
calculator	1
if	1
they	0
make	1
a	0
mistake	1
they	1
find	0
out	0
two	1
months	0
later	1
because	1
they	0
weren't	1
paying	1
attention	1

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
yeah	0

and	0
we	1
have	0
a	0
i	0

i	1
bank	0
at	0
NCNB	0
here	0
and	0
they	1
have	0
a	0
number	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
call	1
in	0
and	0
i	1
always	0
call	0
in	0
like	1
once	1
every	0
other	0
week	0
or	0
so	0
and	0
i	0
will	0
um	0
check	0
off	1
what	0
checks	1
have	0
cleared	0
and	0

yeah	0

do	0
you	1
do	0
that	1

we	1
have	0
the	0
same	0
thing	1

you	0
do	0
too	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
always	0
check	0
them_1	0
off	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
check	0
my	0
balance	0
and	0
my	0
book	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
because_1	0
i	1
always	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
exactly	1
what	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	1

sure	1

i	0
do	0
that	1
real	1
often	0
i	0
do	0
that	1
so	0
anyway	1

okay	1
um	1
yeah	1
one	1
year	1
public	1
service	1
for	1
everybody	1
is	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
it	1
right	1

right	1
uh	1
who	1
wants	1
to	1
start	1
this	1
one	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
i've	0
been	0
i've	0
been	0
sitting	1
here	1
thinking	1
here	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
you	1
know	1
took	1
a	1
couple	1
tries	1
before	1
i	1
found	1
somebody	1
well	0
you	0
know	1
i'm	0
like	1
i'm	0
not	1
really	1
sure	1
what	1
i	0
think	0
about	0
this	1
um	1
uh	1
i	1
mean	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
oh	1
if	1
it's	0
going	1
to	0
be	1
mandatory	1
it's	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
mandatory	1
i	0
mean	1
everybody	1
not	1
just	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
poor	1
people	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
know	0
but	1
you	0
know	0
senators'	1
sons	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
stuff	1
too	1
i	1

right	1
right	1

i	1
mean	0
everybody's	1
got	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
um	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
it'd	1
probably	1
be	0
it'd	1
probably	1
be	1
good	1
i	0
just	1
don't	0
know	1
if	1
you	0
know	0
if	0
i	1
was	0
eighteen	1
or	0
whatever	0
i'd	0
want	1
to	0
be	0
stuck	1
doing	1
it	0
for	0
a	0
year	0
or	0
whatever	1

i'm	0
not	1
sure	0
i	1
want	0
an	1
eighteen	1
year	1
old	1
to	0
make	1
that	1
kind	1
of	0
decision	1
uh	0
i	1
mean	1
uh	1
that	1
that	1
doesn't	1
sound	1
right	1
um	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
see	0
overall	1
beneficial	1
if	0
we're	0
if	1
we're	0
just	1
going	0
from	0
that	1
point	0
of	1
view	1

uh-huh	1

um	0
i	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
old	0
you	1
are	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
was	0
uh	1
in	1
high	1
school	1
was	0
uh	1
beginning	1
of	1
Vietnam	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
peers	1
were	0
being	1
drafted	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	0
many	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
conscientious	1
objections	1
to	1
war	1
or	1
whatever	1
but	1
i	1
i	1
felt	1
strongly	1
then	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
didn't	1
feel	1
like	1
they	1
could	1
kill	1
someone	1
or	1
go	1
into	1
a	1
military	1
situation	1
that	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
help	1
the	1
country	1
in	0
other	0
ways	1
be	1
it	1
cleaning	1
out	1
uh	1
lots	1
in	1
in	1
their	1
neighborhood	1
or	0
whatever	1
kind	1
of	0
community	1
or	0
public	1
service	1
might	0
be	0
available	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	1
guess	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
as	0
as	0
not	1
so	0
much	0
a	0
a	0
demand	1
but	0
but	0
a	0
privilege	1
it's	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	0
uh	0
it's	0
something	1
i[t's]	0

yeah	1
is	0
um	0

it's	1
since	1
since	0
we	0
live	1
here	0
and	0
we	0
all	1
benefit	1
rich	1
poor	1
or	1
in	1
between	1
uh	0
there	0
are	1
benefits	0
even	0
for	0
those	0
who	0
have	1
it	0
the	0
hardest	1
i	0
just	1
see	0
that	1
as	0
maybe	1
a	0
good	0
idea	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
mind	0
doing	0
it	0
at	0
forty	0
four	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
find	1
ways	1
to	0
to	0
turn	1
some	0
of	0
that	0
back	1
to	0
to	0
others	1
uh	0
and	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	0
can't	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
being	1
something	0
to	0
really	1
object	1
to	1

well	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	1
going	1
to	0
depend	1
on	1
how	1
i	1
mean	0
if	1
if	1
you're	0
talking	1
about	1
any	1
if	0
you're	0
talking	1
about	1
something	0
that's	1
like	0
a	0
full	1
time	1
you	0
know	1
one	1
year	1
full	1
time	1
you	1
know	0
this	1
is	0
what	0
you	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
you're	1
going	1
to	0
go	1
and	0
and	1
fill	1
pot	1
holes	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
stuff	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1

i	1
could	0
see	1
a	1
a	0
full	1
a	1
run	1
a	0
gamut	1
of	0
different	0
kinds	1
of	0
opportunities	1
things	1
that	0
need	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
that	0
wou[ld]	0
that	0
could	0
be	1
done	0
in	0
an	0
hour	1
or	0
two	1
uh	0
a	0
day	1
or	0
several	0
hours	1
of	0
the	0
week	0
like	0
a	0
half	1
of	0
a	0
day	0
on	0
Saturday	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	0
in	0
addition	1
to	0
what	0
one	0
does	1
uh	0
besides	1
that	0

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
i	0
can't	1
imagine	1
what	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	0
uh	0
bureaucracies	1
we'd	0
get	0
into	1
and	0
expense	1
having	1
it	0
be	0
full	1
time	1
oh	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
this	0
camp	1
and	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
like	1
um	0
back	0
in	0
the	0
Depression	1
the	0
CCC	1
the	0
the	0
construction	1
corps	1
that	0
went	1
out	0
and	0
did	1
things	0
that	1
was	0
great	1
it	0

yeah	1

it	0
was	0
needed	1
it	0
gave	1
folks	1
some	0
jobs	1
and	0
we	1
got	0
some	0
great	1
public	0
works	1
out	0
of	0
it	0
but	1
um	1
i	1
don't	0
see	0
that	1
as	0
being	0
necessary	1
now	0
i	1
can	0
see	1
it	0
being	0
done	1
uh	0
on	0
a	0
regular	1
schedule	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
everybody	1
has	0
to	0
put	0
in	0
so	1
many	0
hours	1
of	0
uh	0
public	1
service	1
in	0
a	0
given	0
time	1
perhaps	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
i	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
see	0
all	1
of	0
us	0
benefiting	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
don't	1
see	0
it	0
just	0
relegated	1
to	0
the	0
young	1
but	0
i	0
see	1
i	0
i	0
see	1
so	0
much	0
going	0
on	1
that	0
that's	0
bad	1
and	0
this	1
would	0
give	0
them	0
a	0
chance	1
to	0
have	1
some	0
positive	1
self	1
esteem	1
something	0

uh-huh	1

something	0
that	0
they	0
turn	1
back	1

well	0

and	0
also	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
you	0
feel	1
more	1
like	0
you	0
know	1
you're	1
actually	0
part	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
if	1
you've	0
done	1
something	0
in	0
it	0

that's	0
right	1

you	0
take	1
pride	1
in	0
that	1
and	0
and	0
get	1
some	0
some	0
positive	1
feedback	1
from	0
those	1
who	0
benefit	0
besides	1
yourself	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
see	1
it	0
being	0
most	0
beneficial	1
if	0
it's	0
in	0
the	0
neighborhood	1
where	0
or	0
or	0
at	0
least	1
the	0
area	1
where	0
the	0
person	0
lives	1
it	0

uh	0
definitely	1

it	0
may	1
not	0
be	0
the	0
same	1
neighborhood	1
but	0
the	0
same	1
city	1
or	0
county	1
because	1
then	1
you're	0
you're	0
coming	1
in	0
contact	1
with	0
it	0
it's	0
not	1
as	0
meaningful	1
for	0
me	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
Minnesota	1
and	0
do	0
something	0
up	0
there	0
that	0
i'll	0
never	1
be	0
able	0
to	0
see	1
again	0
unless	1
i	0
happen	0
to	0
go	0
on	0
vacation	1
up	1
there	0

right	1

yeah	1

it's	0
so	0
it	0
almost	1
needs	0
to	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
has	1
more	1
impact	1
for	0
the	0
individual	1
on	1
going	1

yeah	1

but	0
as	1
far	1
as	0
putting	1
that	0
into	0
work	1
i	1
don't	1
want	1
to	0
i	1
don't	0
want	0
to	0
deal	1
with	0
the	0
with	1
the	0
heartache	1
of	0
first	1
of	0
all	1
getting	1
it	0
started	1
and	1
figuring	0
out	0
how	1
to	1
do	0
the	0
logistics	1
yeah	0

oh	0
uh	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
nightmare	1

and	1
just	0
i	1
mean	1
just	0
getting	1
getting	1
it	1
going	1

yeah	0

yeah	0

i	0
i	0
see	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
things	0
like	0
uh	0
scouting	1
uh	0
Boys	1
Clubs	0
Girls	1
Clubs	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
that	0
kind	1
of	0
get	1
into	0
that	0
citizenship	1
uh	0
the	0
uh	0
looking	1
after	0
the	0
environment	1
sort	1
of	0
thing	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
don't	1
see	0
uh	0
this	1
being	1
that	0
different	1
but	0
even	1
more	0
beneficial	1
because	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
everybody	1
participated	1
in	0
and	0
would	0
take	1
a	0
turn	1
in	0

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	0
have	1
kids	1

n[o]	0
uh	0
no	1
not	0
yet	0
about_1	0
six	1
months	1
we	0
will	0

oh	1
well	0
good	1
good	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
little	0
time	1
think	0
about	0
that	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	1
have	0
uh	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
teaching	1
school	0
i	0
saw	1
many	0
ki[ds]	0
so	0
many	0
kids	1
that	0
were	0
at	0
loose	0
ends	1
and	1
that	0
didn't	1
really	0
have	1
a	0
purpose	1
and	0
i	0
can	0
see	1
you	1
know	0
some	0
some	0
really	1
significant	1
things	1
coming	0
out	0
of	0
it	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
know	1
you've	0
got	1
to	0
get	0
past	1
that	1
that	0
grudge	1
attitude	0
that	0
many	0
have	1
but	0
that's	1
uh	0
tha[t]	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
part	1
of	0
selling	1
it	0
to	0
the	0
community	1
to	0

uh-huh	1

the	0
adults	1
ahead	1
of	0
them	0
that	0
probably	0
would	0
never	1
serve	1
and	0
and	0
to	0
each	1
succeeding	0
generation	1
there'd	0
definitely	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
major	1
PR	1
campaign	1
in	0
each	0
community	0
each	0
county	1
uh	0
parish	1
or	0
however	1
the	0
state	1
was	0
divided	0
up	1

uh-huh	1

hum	1
i	0
may	0
well	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
around	1
here	1
we	0
have	0
a	0
number	1
of	0
community	0
projects	1
that	0
folks	0
just	0
volunteer	1
for	1
Boy	0
Scout	1
troops	1
or	0
church	1
groups	1
or	0
civic	1
clubs	1
will	0
uh	0
police	1
a	0
uh	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
miles	1
of	0
the	0
highway	1
and	1
kee[p]	0
and	1
i	0
i've	0
seen	1
it	0
in	0
other	0
states	1
too	1
i	1

yeah	1
they	0
have	0
that	0
here	1
um	0

i	1
don't	0
know	0

um	1

they've	0
got	1
um	0
in	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
states	1
around	0
here	0
i	0
think	1
uh	1
you	0
know	0
down	1
in	0
North	0
Carolina	1
there	0
was	1
a	1
big	0
controversy	1
for	0
a	1
while	1
because_1	0
the	0
uh	1
the	0
local	1
chapter	0
of	0
the	0
KKK	1
wanted	0
to	0
uh	0
um	0
to	1
participate	1
in	0
it	0
and	1

and	1
uh	0
there	0
was	0
a	1

and	0
there	0
were	0
those	1
that	0
said	0
no	1
you	0
can't	1
do	1
that	0
i'm	0
sure	1

yeah	1
well	1
uh	0
it	0
was	0
it	0
was	0
interesting	1
because	1
that's	0
an	0
interesting	0
question	1
you	0
know	0
should	1

yeah	0

should	1
these	0
people	0
be	0
allowed	1
to	0
or	1
not	1
i	0
think	1
they	0
finally	1
decided	0
not	1
to	0
because	0
they	0
figured	1
that	1
stretch	1
of	0
highway	1
was	0
going	1
to	1
get	0
trashed	1

oh	1
and	0
i	0
hadn't	1
even	0
thought	1
about	0
that	0
uh	0
the	0
oth[er]	1
the	0
other	0
end	1
of	0
that	0
that	1
that's	1
an	0
interesting	1
uh	0
situation	1
i	0
hadn't	0
thought	1
of	0
that	0
we	1
had	0
visited	1
relatives	1
in	0
Virginia	1
not	0
too	0
long	1
ago	0
and	1
i	0
thought	1
i	0
had	0
seen	1
when	0
we	0
were	0
traveling	1
around	0
the	0
state	1
some	0
similar	1
signs	1
up	0
that	0
indicated	1
that	0
certain	0
sections	1
were	0
being	0
policed	1
and	0
cleaned	0
up	1
and	0

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
Virginia's	1
got	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
know	1
Maryland	1
does	0
and	0
we	1
just	0
we	0
went	1
to	0
Indianapolis	1
last	0
weekend	0
and	0
back	1
and	0
um	0
i'm	0
pretty	1
sure	0
i	0
saw	1
yeah	0
stuff	0
in	0
Ohio	1
and	0
Indi[ana]	0
Indiana	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
Pennsylvania	1
maybe	1
Pennsylvania	1
i	0
don't	0
remember	0
for	0
sure	1
now	0

and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
about	0
your	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1
but	0
uh	1
down	0
here	1
in	0
the	0
last	1
y[ear]	0
oh	0
year	1
plus	1
i	0
it	0
was	0
las[t]	1
beginning	1
with	0
last	1
year's	0
Earth	1
Day	1
there's	0
just	1
been	0
more	1
of	0
a	0
turn	1
toward	1
uh	0
environmental	1
concerns	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
e[ven]	0
i	1
work	0
for	0
Texas	0
Instruments	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
they	0
they've	0
started	1
some	0
recycling	1
campaigns	1
that	0
a	0
year	1
before	0
that	1
had	0
been	0
turned	1
down	1
because_1	0
they	0
said	0
well	1
it's	0
not	1
feasible	1
it's	0

uh-huh	1

it's	0
not	1
a	0
good	0
idea	0
and	1
i	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
being	0
i	1
i	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
being	0
a	0
a	0
a	0
change	1
um	0
it	0
for	0
the	0
positive	1
kind	1
of	0
along	0
the	0
same	1
line	0
as	0
as	0
as	0
the	0
mandatory	1
thing	0
it's	0

yeah	1
and	0
but	0
then	1
they	0
lost	1
too	0
much	0
business	1

it's	0
just	0
thing	1
a	0
part	1
of	0
everyone's	0
consciousness	1

uh-huh	1
well	1
the	0
thing	1
about	0
that	1
is	0
though	0
it's	0
got	1
a	0
i	0
mean	1
because	0
it	0
was	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
was	0
big	1
you	0
remember	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
early	0
seventies	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
just	0
went	1
out	0
of	0
vogue	1
and	1
i	0
i'm	0
worried	1
that	0
it	0
it	1
might	0
you	0
know	0
it'll	0
it	1
the	0
same	1
thing	0
will	0
happen	1
it's	0
like	0
you	0
know	0
environmentalism	1
was	0
really	0
big	1
for	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	1
and	0
then	0
people	0
like	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
i'd	0
rather	1
rather	0
spend	1
you	0
know	0
fifty	1
cents	1
less	1
on	0
uh	0
on	0
on	0
such	1
and	0
such	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
even	1
if	0
it's	0
not	0
environmentally	0
safe	1
who	0
cares	1
you	0
know	0

i'm	0
sure	1
the	0
pendulum	1
will	0
swing	0
the	0
other	0
way	1
uh	0
there	0
have	0
been	0
too	1
many	0
other	1
things	0
that	0
it's	0
done	1
that	0
for	0
just	0
in	0
my	1
life	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
look	1
at	0
history	1
at	0
all	1
you	0
see	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
we	1
go	0
from	0
one	1
side	0
to	0
the	0
other	1
on	0
just	0
about	0
any	1
subject	1
that	0
you	0
one	1
might	0
care	1
to	0
bring	0
up	1

yeah	0

but	1
it	0
is	1
comforting	1
to	0
me	0
to	0
see	1
uh	0
more	1
concern	1
about	0
some	0
of	0
these	0
things	0
that	0
that	0
cost	1
us	0
money	1
especially	1
when	0
we	0
have	0
dwindling	1
uh	0
resources	1
such	1
as	0
oil	1
that's	0
burning	1
out	1
of	0
control	1
in	0
[laughter-in]	0
the	0
Persian	1
Gulf	1
and	0
and	0
so	1
forth	0
just	0
just	0
every	1
little	0
bit	1
does	1
it	0
makes	1
me	0
feel	1
better	0
it	0
it	0
makes	1
me	0
feel	1
like	0
well	1
there	0
may	1
be	0
something	0
left	1
for	0
my	1
children	0
my	0
nieces	1
and	0
nephews	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0

well	0
yeah	1
uh	0
uh	1
well	0
wouldn't	0
it's	0
just	0
probably	1
a	0
good	0
thing	0
that	0
the	0
oil's	1
burning	1
and	0
may	0
may	1
make	0
some	0
people	0
realize	1
that	0
hey	1
you	0
know	0
this	0
stuff	0
runs	0
out	1

that's	0
that's	0
right	1
because	1

of	0
course	1
that's	0
probably	1
blasphemy	1
for	0
you	0
to	0
say	1
uh	0
coming	1
from	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
Texas	1

uh	0
no	1
no	1
because	1
if	0
we	1
what	1
was	0
it	0
in	0
seventy	1
four	1
when	0
we	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
last	0
last	1
oil	1
crisis	1
an[d]	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
started	1
getting	0
smart	1
and	0
and	0
we	0
were	0
looking	1
all	0
these	0
alternative	1
sources	1
of	0
energy	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
as	0
soon	1
as	0
the	0
oil	1
prices	0
came	0
back	0
down	1
we	0
the	0
pendulum	1
swung	1
the	0
other	1
way	1

right	1

and	1
we	1
need	1
those	1
reminders	1

yeah	1

uh	0
or	1
we'll	0
suddenly	1
be	0
in	0
the	0
dark	1
and	0
say	0
oh	1
my	0
goodness	1
now	1
we	0
don't	0
have	1
the	0
ability	1
to	0
go	0
on	1
to	0
some	0
new	1
technology	0

right	1
well	0
my	0
dad's	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
solar	1
energy	0
business	1
so	1
um	0
you	0
know	0
we're	1
acutely	1
aware	1
of	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
this	0
but	1

ah	1

but	1
[laughter-you]	0
know	0
on	0
the	0
other	1
hand	0
he	0
voted	1
for	0
George	0
Bush	1
so	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
wonder	1
sometimes	1
if	0
he	1
knows	0
what	0
he's	0
doing	1

well	1
i	0
thi[s]	0
you	0
know	0
just	1
about	0
anybody	1
you	0
could	0
name	1
whether	0
i	1
voted	0
for	0
them	0
or	0
not	1
uh	0
makes	1
um	0
uh	0
decisions	1
that	0
i	0
just	0
can't	1
go	0
along	0
with	0

uh-huh	1

but	1
uh	0
that's	1
why	0
they're	1
there	0
and	0
not	1
me	0
i	1
don't	0
want	0
the	0
i	1
don't	0
want	0
the	0
[laughter-stress]	1
and	0

yeah	1

well	1
the	0
the	0
thing	1
with	0
Bush	1

okay	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it	1

well	1
uh	1
the	1
roles	1
have	1
definitely	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
generation	1
or	1
so	1

oh	1
yeah	1

um	1
i	1
i	1
think	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
women	1
working	1

uh-huh	1
yeah	1
i	1
do	1
too	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
going	1
to	0
in	1
like	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
i	0
think	1
all	1
women	0
are	1
going	1
to	1
work	1

yeah	1

i	1
mean	1
they	1
may	1
let	0
you	1
off	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
have	1
your	0
baby	1
but	1
that	0
will	0
be	0
it	1

yeah	0

or	1
either	0
they'll	0
have	1
a	1
computer	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
in	0
the	1
hospital	1
where	1
you	0
can	0
just	1
you	1
know	1
just	0
continue	1
right	1
on	1
with	0
your	1
work	1

ye[ah]	0
yeah	1

i	1
mean	1
i[t]	1
it	1
really	1
is	1
coming	1
to	0
that	1
because	0
most	1
women	1
now	1
days	1
cannot	1
afford	1
the	1
time	1
that	0
they	1
could	0
take	1
off	1
unless	1
the	1
company	1
pays	1
them	1

right	1
right	1

they	1
can't	1
even	0
afford	1
to	0
take	1
off	1
you	1
know	1
to	0
have	0
children	1
it	1
seems	1
like	0

and	1
it	1
and	0
it	1
seems	1
if	1
you're	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
kids	1
uh	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
know	1
society	1
has	1
decided	1
for	1
you	1
how	1
many	1
you	1
can	0
really	1
have	1
and	1
make	1
it	0

yeah	1

and	1
uh	1
because	1
if	1
you	0
have	1
you	1
know	0
two	1
well	1
if	0
you	1
go	1
to	0
work	1
you're	1
just	1
working	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
day	1
care	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
you	1
know	1
um	0

right	0

now	0
i	1
was	0
real	1
lucky	1
because	1
my	0
husband	1
had	0
a	1
good	0
enough	1
job	1
where	0
when	0
my	1
kids	1
were	0
you	0
know	0
when	1
i	0
had	1
them	1
and	0
when	0
they	0
were	1
small	1
until	0
they	1
got	0
in	1
junior	1
high	1
school	0
my	0
youngest	1
one	1
got	1
in	0
junior	1
high	1
i	1
didn't	1
have	0
to	0
work	1

uh-huh	1

oh	1
that	0
is	1
good	1

i	1
mean	0
i	0
didn't	1
work	1
i	0
i	1
needed	1
to	1
but	1
i	1
didn't	1

yeah	0
Steve's	1
Steve	1
has	0
a	0
sister	1
who	0
has	0
four	1
she	0
just	0
had	1
her	0
fourth	1
one	1
in	1
uh	0
March	1
and	1
she	1
doesn't	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
either	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
they	0
do	1
it	0
i	1
don['t]	0
i	1
don't	1
know	1
how	0
people	0
do	0
it	0
with	1
one	1
you	1
know	1
um	1
obviously	0

let	1
me	0
tell	1
you	0
you	1
go	1
without	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
things	1
that	0
you	1
wou[ld]	0
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
obviously	1
we	1
don't	1
have	1
any	1
and	1
and	0
i	1
don't	1
i	1
think	1
that's	0
part	1
of	1
the	0
role	0
reversal	1
is	1
it's	0
okay	1
to	0
get	0
married	1
and	1
not	1
have	0
kids	1

oh	1
yeah	1

and	1
i	1
think	1
for	0
society	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
said	1
well	1
you	1
know	1
you're	1
married	1
now	1
you	1
need	0
to	0
se[t]	0
have	0
have	1
your	0
family	1
and	1
i	0
don't	1
think	1
it's	0
been	0
until	1
recently	1
that	0
that	0
they	1
had	1
decided	1
that	0
two	1
people	1
was	1
a	1
family	0

right	1
right	0

you	0
know	0
and	0

well	1
it's	0
getting	1
where	1
you	1
can't	0
hardly	0

your	1
kids	1
any	0
kind	1
of	1
education	1
and	1
stuff	0

and	1
i	1
mean	0
it's	0
hard	1

we	1
uh	1
my	1
youngest	1

i	1
have	0
two	1
i	1
have	1

son	1
and	0

youngest	1
one	0
is	0
going	1
to	0

but	0
if	0
i	1
had	1
a	0
third	1
one	1
i	1
just	0
don't	0
know	1
where	1
it	0
would	0
come	1
from	0

[laughter-yeah]	0

yeah	0

because	1
i	1
work	0
now	1
i	1
work	1
full	1
time	1
and	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
it	0
when	1
you	1
put	0
them	0
through	1
college	1
it	0
just	1
takes	1
just	0
about	1
everything	1
you	0
got	1

yeah	1

they	0
get	0
loans	1
and	0
grants	1
and	0
scholarships	1
and	1
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
that	0
helps	0
out	1
but	0
still	1
it	0
cost	1
a	1
lot	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
mean	0
just	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
cost	1
of	0
living	1
and	0
loans	1
don't	0
pay	1
for	0
groceries	1
and	0
stuff	1

right	1
and	0
cars	1
and	0
all	1
their	0
books	1
and	0
the	0
books	1
are	0
outrageous	1
i	0
mean	1
absolutely	1
outrageous	1
and	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0

and	1
they're	0
getting	0
worse	1
uh	1
my	0
daughter	1
brought	1
home	1
a	0
book	1
the	1
other	0
day	1
that	0
she	1
was	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
for	0
her	0
one	1
of	0
her	0
next	0
classes	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
like	1
ninety	1
six	0
dollars	1
and	0

jeez	0

and	0
this	1
book	1
is	0
a	0
little	1
bitty	0
skinny	1
book	1

yeah	0

i	1
said	0
my	0
goodness	1
what	0
is	1
it	0
lined	1
in	0
gold	1
you	1
know	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
it	0
is	1
it's	0
getting	0
worse	1
and	0
if	0
i'd	1
of	0
probably	0
had	1
three	1
or	0
four	0
children	1
i	0
don't	0
see	1
how	0
we	0
could	0
have	0
made	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
without	1
me	0
working	0

but	0
that's	1
that's	1
probably	1
because	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
had	1
three	1
you	0
you	0
know	0
would	0
say	0
if	0
i'd	1
of	0
had	0
four	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
always	1
not	1
not	1
being	0
able	0
to	0
picture	1
one	1
more	1
but	0
in	0
essence	1
you	0
probably	1
would	0
have	0
worked	1
out	0
fine	1

right	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	0
to	0
work	1

yeah	1

if	1
i'd	1
of	1
had	0
that	1
many	1
i'd	0
of	0
had	1
to	0
work	1
in	1
order	1
for	0
my	0
kids	1
to	0
you	0
know	1
even	1
though	0
he	0
brings	1
in	0
a	1
real	1
good	1
living	1
and	1
everything	1
in	0
order	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
keep	0
up	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	1
to	0
work	0

yeah	0

but	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
getting	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
like	1
when	0
you	1
have	0
one	1
child	1
now	1
that's	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
then	1

then	1
you	0
go	0
to	0
work	1
and	0
you	0
work	1

yeah	1

because	1
if	0
you	1
have	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
kids	1
by	0
the	1
way	1
the	0
inflation's	1
going	1
i	1
think	1
a	1
woman's	1
always	1
going	0
to	1
have	0
to	1
work	1
and	1
it's	1
just	1
going	0
to	1
be	0
an	0
accepted	1
thing	1
there	1
isn't	1
going	0
to	0
be	1
any	1
of	0
this	1
you	0
know	0
very	1
few	1
people	1
will	0
ever	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
that's	1
all	1
right	1
with	0
me	1
because	1
i	1
don't	0
want	1
to	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
i	1
think	0
i'm	1
just	0
part	1
of	0
tha[t]	1
the	0
new	1
stuff	1
that	0
is	1
just	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
would	1
just	1
go	1
nuts	1
sitting	1
at	1
home	1
all	1
day	0
long	1

well	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
how	0
i	1
did	1
because	1
now	1
i	0
work	1
all	0
the	0
time	1

yeah	1

and	1
um	0
well	0
i	0
work	1
all	0
week	1
and	1
um	0
i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
how	1
i	0
stayed	0
home	1

yeah	0

you	1
know	0
i	1
think	1
to	1
myself	1
what	1
did	0
i	1
do	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
just	1
it	0
revolutionized	1
an	0
where	0
a	0
woman	1
thinks	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
you	1
know	0
just	1
like	1
now	0
my	1
daughter	1
there's	1
no	0
way	1
that	0
she	1
can	0
imagine	1
herself	0
married	1
at	0
the	0
age	1
that	0
she's	0
at	0
now	1
to	0
her	1
everything	1
is	0
you've	0
got	0
to	1
go	1
through	0
college	1
you've	1
got	1
to	0
get	1
a	0
job	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
then	1
when	0
everything's	1
set	0
up	1
then	1
you	0
look	0
for	1
somebody	1
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
spend	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
your	0
life	1
with	0
but	0
i	1
mean	0
it	1
is	0
so	1
far	1
down	0
the	0
road	1
where	0

right	1

where	0
now	1
when	0
i	1
graduated	1
high	1
school	0
the	1
thing	1

that's	1
you	0
did	1
that's	1
what	0
you	0
did	1
uh	1

uh-huh	1
and	0
then	1
you	1
got	0
married	1
and	1
then	0
you	1
had	1
a	1
family	1

i	1
mean	1
that's	0
just	0
the	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
that's	1
like	0
when	0
my	0
mo[m]	0
i	0
know	1
when	0
my	0
mother's	1
age	0
it	1
was	0
always	1
the	0
kids	1
and	0
the	0
family	1
and	0
everything	1
had	0
to	0
come	0
first	1
and	0
the	0
woman	1
stayed	0
home	1
and	0
took	0
care	1
of	0
them	0
an	0

i	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
like	1
the	0
way	0
it	0
is	1

yeah	0

it's	0
uh	0
being	1
see	0
we're	1
from	0
Houston	1
and	0
so	0
it's	0
not	1
so	0
hard	1
for	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
you've	1
been	0
married	1
three	1
or	0
so	0
years	1
and	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
kids	1
well	0
it's	0
okay	1
no[t]	0
nobody	0
does	1
but	0
you	0
come	0
to	0
a	0
place	1
like	0
Belton	1
and	1
th[ere]	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
kids	1
here	1
get	1
married	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0

uh-huh	1

it's	0
real	1
small	0
town	0
and	1
it's	0
and	0
a	1
lot	1
of	1
people	1
in	0
our	0
Su[nday]	1
we're	1
the	1
only	0
couple	1
in	0
our	0
Sunday	1
School	0
class	1
except	1
for	0
one	1
other	0
couple	1
who	1
are	1
in	0
their	0
forties	1
and	1
they	1
can't	1
have	0
children	1
who	0
don't	1
have	1
children	1
and	0
they	0
can't	1
imagine	1
why	1
we	0
would	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
children	1
and	0
i'm	0
going	1
well	1
you	0
know	1
there's	0
more	1
to	1
life	1
you	0
know	1
there's	1
life	1
in	0
there	1
that's	0

you	1
know	0
not	0
everybody	1
has	1
to	0
have	0
kids	1
and	0
i'd	1
rather	0
spend	0
the	0
time	1
with	0
my	0
husband	1
than	0
you	0
know	1
spending	0
time	1
here	1
it's	0
your	1
turn	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
that	1
now	1
even	1
whenever	0
i	1
was	0
coming	0
up	1
and	0
everything	0
and	0
we	1
got	0
married	0
right	1
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0
well	0
a	0
year	1
after	0
i	0
got	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
i	1
didn't	0
have	0
kids	1
for	0
four	1
and	0
a	0
half	0
years	1
but	0
that	1
was	0
because	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
work	1
and	1
i	0
wasn't	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
that's	1
what	0
it	1
is	0
i'm	1
not	1
either	1

and	0
everybody	1
thought	1
oh	1
my	0
gosh	1
what	1
is	0
the	0
matter	1
with	0
her	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

they're	0
probably	1
going	0
oh	1
i	0
bet	1
she	0
can't	1
get	0
pregnant	1

right	1
i	1
mean	0
they	1
thought	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
terrible	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
i'd	0
tell	1
them	0
you	0
know	0
well	0
i'm	1
just	0
not	0
ready	1
for	0
children	1
yet	0
oh	1
but	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
you	1
better	1
you	0
better	1
just	0
get	0
ready	1
now	1

yeah	0

well	0
you	1
don't	0
just	1
get	0
ready	1
but	0
i	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
odd	1
because	0
as	0
a	0
general	0
rule	1
the	0
people	1
that	0
married	1
during	0
my	1
time	1
they	1
had	0
kids	1
within	0
a	0
year	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	1
just	0
was	1
not	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	1
i	1
wanted	0
to	0
get	1
out	0
and	1
work	1
a	0
little	0
bit	1
and	1
i	1
wanted	0
to	0
travel	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
which	0
we	0
did	1
and	1
uh	0
kids	1
didn't	0
fit	0
in	1
right	0
then	1
but	0
it's	0
getting	1
more	0
and	0
more	1
like	0
that	1
where	0
there's	0
more	1
and	0
more	0
couples	1
and	1
really	1
if	0
you	1
don't	0
want	1
the	0
kids	0
then	1
it's	0
not	1
the	0
time	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
i	1
don't	0
care	0
what	0
anybody	1
tells	0
you	0

right	1

and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
the	0
attitude's	1
getting	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
because	1
that's	1
like	0
my	0
daughter	1
now	0
she	1
says	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
maybe	1
when	0
she's	0
thirty	1
she	0
might	1
want	0
a	0
child	0
then	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
even	1
though	0
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
have	0
grandchildren	1
i	1
can	0
see	0
her	0
point	1

yeah	1
Steve's	1
mom	1
finally	0
uh	0
finally	1
s[aid]	0
you	0
know	1
said	1
that	0
that	0
God	1
will	0
take	1
care	1
of	0
us	0
when	1
it's	0
our	0
time	1

right	1

she	0
finally	1
admitted	1
you	0
know	1
she	0
finally	1
told	1
me	0
it's	0
okay	1
if	0
you	0
don't	1
but	0
it	1
took	0
every	1
nerve	0
in	0
her	0
body	1
to	0
say	1
that	0
because	0
she's	1
from	0
a	0
very	1
very	0
old	0
fashioned	1
family	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
she	1
stayed	0
home	0
and	0
raised	1
her	0
kids	0
and	0
and	1
she	0
expected	1
all	0
of	0
her	0
kids	1
to	1
do	1
that	0
too	1
and	0
their	1
wives	1
and	0
to	0
be	1
the	0
the	0
housewife	1
and	0
have	0
dinner	1
ready	0
by	0
five	1
and	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
be	1
there	0
at	0
every	0
beck	1
and	0
call	1
and	0
i	1
was	0
raised	0
totally	0
opposite	1
[laughter-how]	1
we	0
got	0
together	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
but	0
because	0
my	1
mother	0
had	0
six	0
girls	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
she	1
worked	0
too	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	0
and	0
i	0
saw	1
how	1
life	1
was	0
when	0
she	0
stayed	0
home	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
rough	1
it	1
was	0
hard	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
and	1
it	0
really	0
is	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
you	0
know	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	1
much	0
more	1
now	0
all	1
my	0
income	1
goes	1
for	0
things	1
like	0
luxuries	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
really	1
does	1
except	1
for	0
what	0
we	1
give	0
to	0
my	0
daughter	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
put	0
her	0
through	0
college	1
and	0
stuff	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
the	0
rest	1
of	0
it	0
we	1
just	0
buy	1
things	1
like	0
boats	1
or	1
we	0
go	0
on	0
trips	1
or	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
the	0
more	1
or	0
less	1
like	0
entertainment	1
stuff	0

right	1

but	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you've	1
earned	1
that	0
though	0

yeah	1
i	1
feel	0
like	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
because	1
well	1
we're	1
to	0
the	0
age	1
now	1
i'm	1
not	0
old	1
but	0
i'm	0
older	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
got	0
to	0
stay	0
home	1
with	0
my	0
kids	1
which	0
i	0
really	1
wanted	1
to	0
do	1
but	0
now	1
i	0
could	0
not	1
go	0
back	1
and	0
do	1
it	0

yeah	0

i	0
really	1
couldn't	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
could	0
stay	1
home	1
all	1
the	0
time	0
and	0
do	0
nothing	1
and	0
i	1
mean	0
i	0
did	1
stuff	0
but	0
to	0
me	1
it	0
[laughter-feels]	1
[laughter-like]	0
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-must]	0
have	0
done	1
nothing	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
just	0
the	0
new	1
way	0
that	0
people	1
are	0
thinking	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
so	1

but	1
uh	0

i	0
think	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
neat	1
if	0
if	0
they	1
could	0
incorporate	1
into	0
small	1
and	0
large	1
businesses	0
both	1
a	0
built	1
in	0
day	1
cares	1
where	0
the	0
children	1
were	0
there	1
in	1
the	0
facility	1
but	0
not	1
necessarily	1
right	1
there	0
with	1
you	0

well	0
you	1
know	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	0
them	0
are	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it	0
is	1
up	0
there	0
where	0
you	1
are	0
but	0
where	0
i	1
am	0
the	0
just	1
like	0
all	1
the	0
hospitals	1
they're	1
getting	0
day	1
care	0

uh-huh	1

are	1
they	0

but	1
the	0
reason	1
they	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
this	0
was	0
because	0
so	1
many	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
so	1
many	0
women	1
could	0
not	1
afford	1
like	0
you	1
said	0
if	0
you	1
had	0
four	1
kids	1
or	0
even	1
if	0
you	1
had	0
two	1
kids	0
you	1
would	0
be	0
paying	1
all	1
your	0
salary	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
those	0
two	0
kids	1
to	0
go	1

right	1

so	1
uh	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	0
our	0
hospitals	1
especially	1
over	0
here	1
are	0
getting	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
bigger	0
companies	1
but	0
it's	0
mainly	1
the	0
hospitals	1

yeah	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
if	0
the	0
TI	1
in	0
Dallas	1
does	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	1
nobody	0
around	0
here	1
does	0
it	0
we're	1
it's	0
too	1
small	1
around	0
here	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

okay	1
uh	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
crime	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
i'm	1
sure	1
i[t]	1
like	1
in	1
yours	1
it's	1
pretty	1
pretty	1
bad	1
uh	0
probably	1
the	1
biggest	1
thing	0
we've	1
got	1
going	1
now	1
is	0
the	1
robberies	1
and	1
theft	1
and	1
probably	1
murder	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
top	1
ones	1
that	0
we	1
have	1
how	0

um-hum	1

how	0
about_1	1
you	0

uh	1
well	1
i	1
don't	1
actually	1
live	1
in	1
the	0
city	1
but	0
uh	1
i'd	1
probably	1
say	1
that's	1
roughly	1
right	1
i	1
mean	1
crimes	1
against	0
property	1
seem	1
to	1
outnumber	1
crimes	1
against	1
life	1
but	1
i	1
i	0
think	1
with	1
the	1
current	1
war	1
on	1
drugs	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
stuff	1
i'd	1
say	1
probably	1
the	1
police	1
department	1
would	0
claim	1
the	0
number	1
one	1
crimes	1
crimes	1
are	0
probably	0
solicitation	1
of	0
prostitution	1
um	0
and	1
sale	1
of	1
drugs	1

um-hum	1
proba[bly]	1
probably	1
right	1
if	0
you	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
from	1
that	1
stand	1
point	1

um-hum	1

what	0
uh	1
is	1
there	1
anything	0
that	0
uh	1
that	1
you	1
particularly	0
are	1
concerned	1
with	1
in	0
in	1
your	1
particular	1
area	1
as	1
far	0
as	1
security	1
and	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	0

uh	1
where	1
i	1
live	1
no	1
it's	1
it's	1
not	1
so	0
bad	1
i	1
mean	1
i	1
can	1
basically	1
leave	1
my	1
front	1
door	1
unlocked	1
and	1
not	0
have	1
to	1
worry	1
about	1
it	0
um	0
but	0
i	1
do	1
have	1
friends	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
get	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
fallout	1
from	1
this	1
war	1
on	1
drug	1
thing	1
um	1
just	1
because	1
there	1
are	1
like	1
crack	1
houses	1
you	1
know	1
on	1
their	1
street	1
and	1
stuff	1
like	0
this	1

um-hum	0
do	0
you	1
live	1
in	0
a	0
real	1
small	0
town	1
or	0
or	1
out	0
in	1
the	1
country	1

i	1
live	1
out	1
in	1
the	0
country	1
yeah	1

how	0
far	0
out	0
from	1
the	1
city	0
i	0
mean	0
do	1
you	0

i	0
am	1
about	1
fifteen	1
miles	0
out	1

about_1	1
fifteen	0
miles	0
i	1
live	1
in	0
a	1
little	0
suburb	1
uh	1
which	1
is	1
i	1
guess	1
from	1
Dallas	1
is	0
twelve	1
miles	1
or	1
so	1

um-hum	1

but	1
it's	1
pretty	0
congested	1
we	1
are	1
considered	1
in	1
the	0
country	0
but	1

hm	1

but	1
it	1
doesn't	1
really	0
feel	1
like	1
you're	1
in	0
the	0
country	1

hm	0

our	1
major	0
crimes	1
in	1
our	1
immediate	1
town	1
uh	0
is	0
probably	1
robberies	0
house	1
robberies	0
and	0
very	0
few	1
instances	1
of	0
you	0
know	1
alcohol	1
drug	0
uh	1
reported	1

um-hum	0

however	1
i'm	1
sure	1
they're	1
there	1

um-hum	1

but	0
uh	1
right	1
now	1
our	0
neighborhood	1
is	1
running	0
about	1
uh	1
eighty	1
percent	0
of	1
the	0
homeowners	1
have	1
been	0
robbed	1
sometime	1
during	0
their	1
their	1
uh	1
existence	1
in	1
that	0
neighborhood	1

wow	0

that's	0
huge	0

and	1
since	1
that	1
time	1
everybody's	1
gotten	1
some	0
sort	1
of	0
burglar	1
system	0
or	0
you	1
know	0
uh	0
burglar	1
alarms	0
uh	1
and	1
including	1
the	0
out	1
uh	1
the	1
outer	1
perimeter	1
type	1
uh	1
devices	1
the	1
sensors	1
and	1
things	1
like	0
that	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	1

it's	1
cut	1
back	1
you	0
know	1
considerably	1
but	1
it	0
it	1
just	1
shifts	1
it	1
from	1
our	1
neighborhood	1
to	1
another	1
neighborhood	1
to	1
another	1
neighborhood	1
so	1
it	1
still	1
uh	0
remains	1
city	1
wide	0
pretty	1
pretty	0
high	1

are	0
they	1
are	0
there	0
any	0
theories	1
on	0
why	1
this	0
is	0
happening	1

uh	0
i	0
would	1
say	0
the	1
majority	1
of	1
it's	0
happening	1
during	1
the	0
day	1
uh	0
between	1
probably	1
ten	1
in	0
the	0
morning	1
and	1
three	1
in	1
the	0
afternoon	1

um-hum	0

most	1

but	0
why	0
why	0
is	0
it	0
happening	0

well	0
most	1
families	1
most	1
families	0
they	0
are	1
young	1
and	1
both	0
people	0
are	1
working	1

um-hum	0

so	0
they're	0
happening	1
during	0
the	0
hours	1
they're	0
gone	1
from	0
work	1

um-hum	1

uh	1
so	1
uh	0
i	0
would	1
say	0
that's	1
probably	0
their	1
prime	1
motivation	1
they'll	1
s[talk]	0
they'll	0
stalk	1
your	1
house	1
and	0
uh	0
look	0
at	0
your	1
pattern	1
and	1
then	1
go	0
from	0
there	1

so	0
they're	0
professionals	0

um	0
they	1
classify	1
most	0
of	1
them_1	1
as	1
professionals	1

hm	0

uh	0
you	0
get	0
a	1
few	1
of	1
them_1	0
that	0
are	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
sloppier	1
uh	0
just	1
taking	1
uh	0
you	1
know	1
just	0
junk	1
items	0
that	0
they	1
they	0
can	0
just	0
get	1
you	0
know	0
ten	1
to	0
twenty	1
bucks	0
for	0
real	0
quick	1

um-hum	0

probably	1
the	0
biggest	1
items	1
that	1
uh	0
that	0
you	0
get	1
in	0
our	0
neighborhood	1
or	0
would	1
be	1
the	1
high	1
classed	1
automobiles	1
Mercedes	1
Volvos	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
can	0
get	1
you	0
know	1
big	1
dollars	0
for	1
uh	0
jewelry	1
are	1
the	0
major	1
targets	1
guns	0

um-hum	0

guns	0
that	1
sort	0
of	1
stuff	1

hm	0

very	0
few	0
you	1
know	0
penny	0
penny	0
ante	1
stuff	0

well	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
think	1
can	0
be	0
done	1
to	0
reduce	1
that	0
sort	0
of	0
crime	1

well	0
uh	0
the	0
police	1
force	0
for	0
one	0
i	0
think	0
they	0
could	1
uh	0
definitely	1
add	1
to	0
the	0
police	0
force	1
and	0
the	0
type	0
equipment	1
that	0
they	0
use	1
uh	0
it's	1
oh	0
right	1
now	0
i	0
think	1
uh	1
we're	1
about	1
thirty	1
thousand	0
people	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
eight	1
officers	0
that	0
patrol	1
for	0
thirty	1
for	0
that	1
amount	0
of	0
people	1
which	0
is	1
not	0
very	0
many	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

right	0

and	0

but	0
that	0
mean	0
that's	0
gonna	0
tend	0
to	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
me	1
that	0
sort	0
of	0
approach	1
will	0
tend	1
to	0
simply	0
make	1
the	0
cost	1
of	0
committing	0
the	0
crime	0
slightly	1
higher	1
in	0
other	0
words	0
you've	0
increased	0
the	0
probability	1
of	0
somebody	0
being	0
caught	1
a	0
little	0
bit	1
the	0
real	1
question	1
is	0
how	0
do	1
you	1
convince	1
people	0
not	1
to	0
commit	0
such	0
crimes	1
in	1
the	0
first	0
place	1

well	0
the	0
course	0
in	0
our	1
particular	0
state	1
uh	0
we	0
have	0
the	0
prison	1
overcrowding	0
whatever	1
so	0
they're	0
giving	0
the	0
early	1
release	1
uh	0

right	0
they're	0
doing	1
that	0
in	0
our	0
state	1
t[oo]	0

yeah	0
and	0
and	0
it's	0
i	0
think	1
what	0
they	0
need	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
stop	0
building	1
more	0
jails	1
and	0
start	0
giving	1
stiffer	0
sentences	1
uh	0
but	0
for	1
the	0

so	0
you	1
think	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
deterrent	1

that	0
would	0
be	1
certainly	0
be	0
a	0
deterrent	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
not	0
necessarily	0
you	1
know	0
uh	0
give	0
in	0
to	0
their	1
uh	0
human	0
rights	1
desires	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
they're	0
overcrowded	0
just	0
keep	0
cramming	0
them_1	0
in	0
there	0
till	0
they	0
just	0
suffocate	0
uh	0

well	0
what	0
about	0
an	0
innocent	0
person	0
who	0
happens	0
to	0
have	0
been	0
found	0
guilty	0

uh	0
i	0
think	1
they'd	0
have	1
to	0
go	1
to	0
extra	1
measures	1
to	0
make	0
sure	1
a	0
person's	0
guilty	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
cases	1
course	0
i	0
i	0
know	0
you	0
can't	0
be	0
a	0
hundred	0
percent	0
foolproof	0

right	0

uh	0

so	0
you'd	1
you'd	1
rather	0
see	1
it	0
harder	1
to	1
convict	0
somebody	1

i'd	0
rather	1
see	1
it	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
harder	1
and	0
have	0
a	0
little	1
bit	0
more	0
evidence	1
uh	0
to	0
convict	1
somebody	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
then	0
those	0
convicted	0
especially	0
of	0
you	0
know	0
murder	0
and	0
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
major	0
crimes	0
uh	0
to	0
reach	0
the	0
life	0
sentences	0
and	0
you	0
know	0
death	0
penalties	0
and	0
follow-through	0
with	0
that	0

um-hum	0

hm	0

uh	0
especially	1
you	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	1
case	0
of	1
murder	1

right	0

uh	0
i	0
know	1
in	0
my	1
case	0
i	1
ha[d]	0
my	0
wife	1
and	0
daughter	0
were	0
kidnapped	1
during	0
a	0
house	1
robbery	1
back	1
in	0
eighty	0
five	1

oh	0
wow	0

oh	0
my	0
goodness	0

and	1
we	0
caught	1
the	0
individuals	1
got	0
caught	1
we	0
uh	0
we	0
went	1
through	0
the	0
court	1
system	1
and	0
all	0
that	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
two	1
counts	0
of	0
kidnapping	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
forty	1
five	0
to	0
the	0
head	1
you	0
know	0
just	1
the	1
the	0
mental	0
anguish	1
and	0
the	0
whole	0
nine	0
yards	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
guy	1
only	0
got	0
five	0
years	1

um-hum	0

right	0

wow	0

and	1
you	0
know	0
he	1
was	0
out	0
within	1
two	0
months	1
because	0
of	0
the	0
parole	1
system	0
so	0
what	0
what	0

did	0
you	1
did	0
you	0
sue	1
him	0
under	1
the	0
civil	0
system	1

do	0
what	0
now	0

did	0
you	0
sue	1
him	0
under	0
the	0
civil	0
system	1

n[o]	0
no	0
i'm	0
not	0
real	0
familiar	0
with	0
that	0

well	0
you	0
probably	1
sue	0
him	0
for	0
mental	0
anguish	1
or	0
something	1
right	1
and	0
try	1
to	0
get	0
money	0
from	0
him	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0

well	1
the	0
insurance	1
companies	0
and	1
all	0
that	1
tried	1
to	0
tried	1
to	0
go	0
after	1
him	0
and	0
they	0
said	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
he	1
they're	1
he	0
has	0
no	0
job	1
he	1
has	0
nothing	1
there's	0
nothing	1
that	0
he	0
has	1
that	0
that	0
you	0
could	0
go	0
after	1

yeah	0
makes	1
you	0
wish	1
they	0
had	1
uh	0
still	0
had	0
indentured	1
servitude	1
for	0
this	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	1

yeah	0
uh	0
very	0
seldom	0

but	0
they	1
g[ive]	0
give	1
the	0
guy	0
a	0
job	1
in	0
prison	1
and	0
make	1
him	0
pay	0
his	0
damn	1
debt	1

yeah	0
they	0
don't	1
do	0
that	0
here	1
course	0
they	0
pay	0
them	0
but	0
they	0
don't	0
you	0
don't	0
you	1
or	0
the	0
insurance	1
companies	0
never	1
see	0
any	0
of	0
that	0
money	1

yeah	0
that's	0
too	0
bad	0

and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
and	0
they're	1
right	0
now	0
they're	0
reluctant	1
to	0
go	0
after	0
them_1	0
because	0
they're	1
you	0
know	1
they're	1
they're	0
repeat	1
offenders	1
they	1
uh	0
they've	0
been	1
in	0
jail	0
before	1
they've	0

um-hum	0
um-hum	0

they've	0
been	0
released	1
you	1
know	0
several	0
times	1
which	0
is	0
another	1
uh	0
deal	1
i	0
hate	0
to	0
see	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	1
you	0
know	1
basically	1
the	0
guy	0
commits	1
you	0
know	1
three	1
major	0
crimes	1
and	0
uh	0
and	0
car	1
theft	0
on	0
top	0
of	0
it	1
and	0
destroys	1
my	0
car	1
he	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
a	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

he	0
we're	0
out	1
you	0
know	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
fifteen	1
thousand	0
dollars	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
guy	1
gets	0
out	0
in	0
two	0
months	1
and	0

that's	0
awful	0

and	0
he	0
goes	0
out	0
and	0
commits	1
it	0
again	1
fact	0
he's	0
back	1
in	0
[laughter-jail]	1
now	0
so	0
what	0
what	0
uh	0

gives	1
you	0
sympathy	1
for	0
the	0
vigilantes	1

yeah	0
what	1
what	0
deterrent	1
does	0
he	0
really	0
have	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
in	0
our	1
in	0
our	1
particular	0
neighborhood	1
vigilantism	1
is	0
becoming	1
a	0
real	1
real	0
possibility	1

um-hum	0

uh	0
we've	0
had	0
a	0
couple	1
instances	0
where	0
break-ins	1
where	0
the	1
the	0
people	0
have	1
actually	1
you	0
know	1
shot	1
the	0
people	1

oh	0
my	0
God	0

and	0
uh	0
return	0
offenders	0
have	0
they've	0
actually	1
waited	1
for	0
them_1	0
where	0
they've	0
robbed	1
you	0
know	1
particular	0
neighborhood	1
they'll	0
rob	1
one	0
house	1
then	1
other	0
people	1
will	0
wait	0
up	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
wait	1
for	0
somebody	0
to	0
do	0
something	0
else	1
and	0
try	0
to	0
take	1
it	0
in	0
their	0
own	0
hands	1
course	0

right	0

course	0
it	0
doesn't	0
always	0
work	1
out	0
in	0
their	0
favor	1

right	0

but	0
uh	0
nevertheless	1
i	0
think	0
people	1
are	0
just	0
getting	0
fed	0
up	1
and	0
saying	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
can't	1
arrest	0
all	1
of	0
us	0
you	1

um-hum	0

you	1
can	0
you	0
know	1
you	1
can	0
get	0
some	1
of	0
us	0
you	0

i	0
mean	0

you	0
can't	1
get	0
all	1
of	0
us	0

mean	0
that	0

uh	0
and	0
we're	1
beginning	0
to	0
see	1
more	1
and	0
more	0
of	0
that	1

that	0
sounds	1
that's	0
a	0
deterrent	1
too	1
if	0
you	0
think	1
the	0
home	1
owner	0
might	0
be	0
armed	1
right	1
and	0
awake	1

yeah	0

hear	0
you	0
break	0
in	0
and	0
you're	0
gonna	1
get	0
shot	1

yeah	0
that's	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	0
certainly	1
a	0
a	0
possibility	1
an[d]	0
an[d]	0
we	0
have	1
had	0
a	0
a	0
few	1
cases	1
where	0
the	0
guy	1
has	0
broken	0
in	1
you	0
know	1
during	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
the	0
night	1
and	0
gotten	1
himself	0
shot	0
to	0
death	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
it	0
helps	1
for	0
a	0
while	1

um-hum	0

but	0
then	0
just	0
another	0
different	1
set	0
of	0
people	1
come	0
in	1
and	0
most	1
of	0
the	0
people	0
are	0
transients	1
from	0
out	1
outside	1
of	0
the	0
state	1

hm	0

uh	0
i	0
would	0
say	0
probably	0
eighty	1
percent	0
of	0
them_1	0
that	0
are	0
caught	1
they're	1
from	0
places	1
like	0
up	0
in	0
Oklahoma	1
and	1
Louisiana	1
Arkansas	1
you	0
know	0
across	1
the	0
the	0
border	1

wow	0

so	0
you	0
know	0
people	0
who	0
don't	1
readily	0
read	0
the	0
newspapers	1
in	0
our	0
town	1
or	0
whatever	1

um-hum	0

it's	0
not	0
many	0
from	0
the	0
local	1
communities	1

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0
it's	0
a	0
problem	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
just	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
the	0
court	1
systems	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
more	0
accurate	1
in	0
in	0
stiffer	1
in	0
their	0
penalties	1

yeah	0

would	0
be	0
a	0
definite	1
deterrent	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
giving	1
the	0
uh	0
police	1
uh	0
agencies	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
jurisdiction	0
over	0
what	1
they	0
do	1
when	0
they	1
when	0
they	0
catch	1
these	0
people	1

yeah	0

um-hum	0
i	0
mean	0
i	1
i	1
tend	0
to	0
agree	1
with	0
you	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
what	0
i	1
would	0
like	1
to	0
see	0
is	0
number	0
one	1
completely	1
getting	0
rid	1
of	0
these	0
victimless	1
crimes	1
um	0
there's	0
no	0
reason	1
to	0
enforce	1
those	0
and	0
spend	0
time	1
and	0
money	0
doing	1
it	0
and	1
and	0
worry	1
about	0
these	0
things	0
where	0
people	1
are	0
getting	0
hurt	1

right	0

and	1
i	0
think	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
big	0
things	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
is	0
to	0
increase	0
deterrence	1
is	1
um	0
if	0
someone	1
is	0
found	0
guilty	1
of	0
a	1
uh	0
felony	1
level	0
offense	1
they	0
lose	1
their	0
citizenship	1
and	0
they	0
lose	1
their	0
constitutional	0
rights	1

um-hum	0

you	1
know	0
and	0
just	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
things	1
that	0
we're	0
trying	0
to	0
worry	1
about	1
you	0
know	1
protecting	0
these	0
people	1
from	0
we	1
just	0
don't	0
protect	1
them_1	0

i	0
know	1
like	0
in	0
my	0
wife's	1
case	0
they	0
made	1
her	0
feel	0
like	0
the	0
criminal	1

i	0
know	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
ridicul[ous]	0

they	1
they	0
went	0
to	0
all	1
all	1

is	1
uh	1
kind	1
of	1
fun	1
it's	1
best	1
done	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
leisure	1
time	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
more	1
of	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
childhood	1
days	1
than	1
i	1
have	1
now	1
and	1
i	1
grew	1
up	1
in	1
an	1
area	1
that	1
uh	1
it	1
was	0
just	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
from	1
a	1
rather	1
large	1
lake	1
and	1
a	0
few	1
more	1
miles	1
from	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
even	0
larger	1
lake	0
and	1
we	0
had	1
a	1
variety	1
of	0
boats	1
at	1
our	1
disposal	1
um	0
i	0
worked	1
for	0
a	1
camp	1
for	1
a	0
number	1
of	1
years	1
my	1
father	1
was	0
on	0
staff	1
there	1
and	0
we	0
had	1
every	0
kind	1
of	0
things	1
from	1
canoes	1
to	0
paddle	1
boats	0
sailboats	1
um	1
speedboats	1
uh	0
you	1
name	1
it	1
they	0
had	1
it	1
and	0
we	0
did	0
a	1
lot	1
of	1
watering	1
water	1
sports	1
but	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
the	1
thing	1
i	0
liked	1
the	0
best	1
was	0
uh	0
we	0
spent	1
about	0
a	0
summer	1
couple	1
of	0
guys	1
uh	1
restored	0
an	0
old	1
wooden	1
boat	1
that	0
was	1
built	1
back	1
in	0
the	0
mid	0
thirties	1
and	0
got	1
a	0
new	1
canvas	1
sail	1
for	0
it	0
and	0
had	0
a	0
real	1
hu[ge]	0
big	1
old	0
four	1
foot	0
center	1
board	0
that	0
went	0
down	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
to	0
keep	0
you	0
upright	1
when	0
the	0
waves	1
or	0
the	0
wind	1
came	0
from	0
the	0
side	1
and	0
we	0
got	0
that	0
thing	1
in	0
the	0
water	1
and	0
had	1
a	0
real	0
good	0
time	1
with	0
it	0
if	0
you	1
ever	0
got	1
it	0
dumped	1
over	0
though	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
mess	1
to	0
get	0
back	0
up	1
it	0
wasn't	0
like	1
the	0
newer	0
ones	0
that	0
have	0
nice	1
chambers	1
that	0
keep	1
it	0
afloat	1
or	0
keep	0
it	0
uh	0
upright	1
again	1
this	0
one	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
work	1
with	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-get]	0
[laughter-out]	0
[laughter-of]	0
the	0
water	1
again	0
and	0
get	0
it	0
upright	1
and	0
uh	0
sailing	1
was	0
was	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
to	0
learn	1
the	0
maneuvers	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
make	1
to	0
work	1
your	0
way	0
down	0
a	0
lake	1
or	0
work	0
back	1
up	0
against	0
the	0
the	0
wind	1
as	0
it	0
were	0
attacking	1
back	0
and	0
forth	1
and	0
um	0
more	1
than	0
once	1
we'd	0
get	0
out	0
there	1
on	0
a	0
really	0
stormy	1
day	1
and	0
uh	0
the	0
storm	1
or	0
the	0
wind	1
was	0
due	1
to	0
the	0
s[torm]	0
front	1
blowing	0
in	1
and	0
soon	1
as	0
the	0
front	1
came	0
over	1
it	0
was	0
calm	1
so	0
you're	0
out	1
in	0
the	0
middle	0
of	0
nowhere	1
with	0
a	0
paddle	1
[laughter-and]	0
[laughter-you]	0
paddle	1
your	0
way	0
back	0
in	1
and	0
hope	1
it	0
doesn't	0
start	1
raining	1
on	0
you	0
right	0
away	1
and	0
that	0
didn't	0
always	0
work	1
we	0
often	1
times	1
got	0
wet	1
but	1
um	0
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
nice	1
nice	0
hobby	1
to	0
have	1
and	0
nowadays	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
could	0
afford	1
the	0
boat	1
or	0
the	0
time	1
nor	0
do	0
we	0
live	0
that	1
close	0
to	0
a	0
lake	1
anymore	0
so	0
things	0
change	1
i	0
guess	1
what	0
are	0
your	1
memories	1
of	0
boating	1
or	0
current	1

um	1
about	1
the	1
only	1
memories	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
of	1
boating	1
um	1
my	1
husband's	1
family	1
had	1
a	1
a	1
motor	1
boat	1
um	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
engaged	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
us	1
out	1
on	1
the	0
lake	1
several	1
times	1
and	1
uh	1
i	1
really	1
did	1
enjoy	1
that	1
i	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
ever	1
learned	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
or	1
anything	1
but	1
um	1
we	1
did	0
some	0
water	1
skiing	0
of	0
course	1
and	1
and	1
uh	1
driving	1
around	1
the	1
lake	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
and	1
just	1
the	1
basic	1
safety	1
rules	1
and	1
things	1
i	1
found	1
real	1
interesting	1
um	1
you	1
know	1
they	0
you	0
they	0
just	1
didn't	0
patrol	1
you	0
like	1
they	0
did	1
with	0
the	1
automobile	1
or	1
whatever	0
the	0
the	0
laws	1
were	1
there	1
and	0
if	1
you	1
didn't	1
obey	1
them_1	1
uh	1
you	0
know	1
[laughter-there]	1
were	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
accidents	1
i	0
guess	1

right	1

it's	0
true	1

but	1
um	0
i	1
found	1
the	1
motor	1
boating	1
was	1
real	1
fun	1

yeah	1
i	1
remember	0
learning	1
how	1
to	0
ski	1
oh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
was	0
seven	1
or	0
eight	1
years	0
old	1
and	0
the	0
lake	1
that	0
we	0
learned	1
on	0
was	0
the	0
smaller	1
of	0
the	0
two	1
that	0
we	0
had	0
access	1
to	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
maybe	0
fifteen	1
twenty	0
acres	1
and	1
it	0
was	0
uh	0
it	0
had	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
um	0
turtles	1
in	0
it	0
and	0
i	1
got	0
all	1
ready	1
to	0
go	0
and	0
i	1
was	0
down	1
in	0
the	1
water	1
and	0
and	0
set	1
to	0
go	1
and	1
a	0
and	1
just	1
as	0
that	1
boat	1
took	1
off	1
a	0
turtle	1
bit	1
me	0
in	0
the	0
middle	0
of	0
the	0
back	1
it	0

oh	1

it	0
didn't	0
hurt	0
too	0
much	1
but	0
it	0
bit	0
enough	1
to	0
where	1
i	0
let	0
go	1
and	0
the	0
boat	1
went	0
off	0
without	1
me	0
and	0
i	0
reached	0
back	1
there	0
and	0
sn[atched]	0
pushed	1
him	0
away	1
and	0
got	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
water	1
a	0
a	0
while	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
it	0
didn't	1
even	0
leave	0
a	0
mark	1
it	0
was	0
just	0
a	0
little	0
nibble	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
told	1
everybody	0
what	0
happened	1
and	0
they	0
go	0
oh	0
yeah	1
sure	1
you	0
know	0
and	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
get	1
back	0
down	0
in	0
there	1
and	0
and	0
i'll	1
be	1
if	0
he	1
didn't	0
do	0
it	0
again	1
this	0
time	1
a	0
little	0
earlier	1
and	0
and	0
i	1
had	0
let	0
go	0
before	1
then	0
and	0
before	1
they	0
took	0
off	1
this	0
time	1
and	0
and	0
swatted	1
him	0
away	1
so	0
i	0
moved	0
over	1
a	0
a	0
few	0
feet	1
in	0
the	0
water	1
and	0
got	1
out	0
of	0
his	1
little	0
realm	1
where	0
he	0
was	0
living	1
underneath	0
the	0
dock	1
and	0
uh	0
managed	1
to	0
get	0
up	1
didn't	0
go	1
very	0
far	1
but	0
i	0
got	0
up	1
and	0
it	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
nice	1
uh	0
nice	0
long	1
skiing	1
career	1
but	0
now	1
i've	0
gotten	0
to	0
where	0
skiing	1
is	0
just	0
kind	0
of	0
wears	1
me	0
out	1
more	0
than	0
it	0
does	1
thrill	1
me	0
i've	0
i've	0
uh	0
done	1
about	0
all	0
i	0
dare	1
do	0
on	0
skis	1
you	0
know	0
skiing	1
on	0
one	1
and	0
jumping	1
around	0
here	1
and	0
there	1
and	0
i	0
i	0
i	0
know	1
how	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
injured	1
doing	0
much	0
more	1
than	0
that	1
and	0
i	0
just	1
can't	1
risk	1
it	0
right	0
now	1
being	0
a	0
head	1
of	0
the	0
family	1
and	0
the	0
breadwinner	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
just	0
uh	0
can't	0
take	0
the	0
risk	1
i	0
did	1
as	0
a	0
dumb	0
teenager	1
i	0
guess	1
so	0
life	1
changes	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
in	0
that	1
respect	1
i'd	0
kind	0
of	0
like	1
someday	1
to	0
maybe	1
end	0
up	0
on	0
a	0
pair	1
of	0
skis	1
that	0
that	0
doesn't	0
have	1
a	0
uh	0
well	0
what	0
they	0
call	1
trick	1
skis	0
they'll	0
allow	1
you	0
to	0
ski	0
backwards	1
i	0
haven't	0
cra[ft]	0
managed	1
to	0
get	0
a	1
hold	1
on	0
that	1
uh	0
craft	1
yet	1
but	0
uh	0

that	1
sounds	1
like	1
a	1
real	1
challenge	1

yeah	0
it	0
it'd	0
be	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
i	0
hadn't	0
quite	0
figured	0
out	1
i	0
don't	0
have	1
anybody	0
to	0
teach	1
me	1
either	0
that's	0
another	1
little	0
thing	1
you	0
need	1
somebody	0
to	0
kind	1
of	0
tell	0
you	0
what	1
to	0
do	1
but	0
just	1
from	0
what	0
i've	0
seen	1
you	0
just	0
kind	0
of	0
w[ork]	0
work	1
your	0
way	0
up	1
to	0
it	1
and	0
turn	0
around	1
real	0
quick	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0
grab	1
the	0
rope	1
behind	1
you	0
and	0
then	0
just	0
l[et]	0
let	0
go	1
real	0
quick	1
and	0
let	0
it	0
whip	1
you	0
around	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
maybe	0
someday	1
i'll	1
i'll	0
get	0
back	1
to	0
that	1
as	0
after	0
the	0
kids	1
are	0
up	0
and	0
grown	1
and	0
the	0
monies	1
are	0
there	1
to	0
get	0
away	1
for	0
times	1
on	0
end	1
uh	0
weekend	1
or	0
something	1

well	0
my	1
son	1

okay_1	1
so	1
what	1
are	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
views	1
o[n]	1
on	1
capital	1
punishment	1

i	1
have	1
ambivalent	1
feelings	1
because	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
it	1
serves	1
as	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
deterrent	1
we	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	0
hand	1
it	0
is	1
very	1
very	1
expensive	0
to	1
maintain	1
you	1
know	1
Texas	1
has	0
one	1
of	1
the	0
biggest	1
criminal	1
justice	0
systems	1
in	1
the	0
country	0

yes	1

and	1
it's	1
eating	1
us	0
alive	1
budget	1
wise	0
and	1
um	1

so	1
are	1
they	1
currently	1
practicing	1
capital	1
punishment	1
in	1
your	1
state	1

yes	1
we	1
do	1
practice	1
capital	0
punishment	1

but	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
uh	1
courts	1
and	1
the	1
appeals	1
and	1
the	1
stays	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
means	1
that	0
it's	0
a	1
very	1
long	0
haul	0
before	1
anybody's	1
ever	0
executed	1

yes	1
that's	1
similar	1
to	1
Georgia	1

yeah	0
and	1
then	1
i	1
was	1
reading	1
in	0
the	1
paper	1
just	1
this	0
morning	1
it's	1
interesting	1
because_1	1
i	0
had	1
forgotten	1
i	0
guess	1
that	1
i	1
wrote	1
this	1
little	1
topic	0
down	1
that	1
it	0
costs	0
more	1
to	1
execute	1
somebody	1
tha[n]	1
than	0
it	0
does	1
to	0
keep	1
them_1	0
because	1
of	0
all	0
the	1
costs	1
of	0
the	0
appeals	1
and	0
all	1
that	0
you	0
know	0

that's	1
probably	1
true	1
considering	1

yes	1

yes	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	0
it	1
it	0
kind	1
of	1
defeats	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
having	1
capital	0
punishment	1
if	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
capital	1
punishment	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	0
be	1
primarily	1
a	1
deterrent	1
to	0
other	1
people	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
would	1
see	1
it	1

yes	1

right	1
that	1
would	0
be	1
the	1
intent	1
of	0
it	1

yeah	1
but	1
i'm	1
not	1
sure	1
how	1
successful	1
that	1
is	1

well	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
would	1
be	0
more	0
successful	1
if	1
it	0
was	1
applied	1
in	0
a	0
more	0
expedient	0
manner	1
if	0
there	0
weren't	1
so	0
many	1
appeals	1

quicker	1
maybe	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
if	0
if	0
the	1
person	1
who's	0
gonna	0
commit	0
the	0
crime	1
knew	1
that	0
they	1
were	0
gonna	0
be	1
punished	0
severely	1
possibly	1
capital	0
punishment	1

um-hum	1

what	0
what	1
kind	0
of	0
work	1
do	0
you	0
do	0

uh	0
i'm	1
a	1
research	1
engineer	1
i	0
work	1
uh	1
f[or]	0
with	0
Georgia	1
Tech	1

hum	1
well	1
see	0
i'm	1
a	0
school	0
principal	1

um	1

elementary	1
school	1

yes	1

and	1
in	1
a	0
very	1
poor	1
section	1
of	1
town	1
with	1
pr[edominantly]	1
predominantly	1
Anglo	1
kids	1
and	0
i	1
see	0
kids	0
already	1
that	1
are	0
gonna	0
be	1
criminals	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
everything	1
we	0
can	0
do	1

hum	0

and	0
see	0
i'm	1
afraid	1
i	1
think	0
if	1
we	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
equivalent	1
amount	1
of	1
money	0
and	0
invest	1
it	0
in	0
young	1
people	0
that	0
i	1
mean	1
course	0
you	0
couldn't	1
do	1
that	1
because_1	1
you	0
got	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
the	1
ones	0
that	1
are	1
already	0
there	1

um-hum	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
if	1
we	0
would	1
make	0
a	0
bigger	1
investment	1
in	1
kids	1
we'd	0
have	1
fewer	1
decisions	1
to	1
make	1
down	0
the	0
road	1
you	0
know	1

um	0
that's	0
probably	1
true	1
but	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	0
other	1
factors	0
that	1

oh	1
yeah	0

but	0
pu[mping]	1
pu[mping]	1
pumping	1
more	0
money	0
into	0
the	1
school	1
system	0
is	1
a	0
good	1
thing	0
but	1

well	1
i'm	1
not	1
talking	0
about_1	1
just	1
in	1
the	0
school	1
system	0

but	1
it's	0
not	1
gonna	0

oh	0
i	0
see	1

see	0
i'm	1
talking	0
about_1	1
like	0
in	1
in	0
uh	0
i'm	1
afraid	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
kids	1
who	0
just	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
taken	1
out	1
of	0
their	0
homes	1
and	1
reared	1
uh	0
i	0
know	0
institutions	1
don't	0
work	0
that	1
well	1
but	0
it's	0
a	1
bad	1
day	1
[laughter-because_1]	1
[laughter-because_1]	0
i	1
have	0
all	1
these	0
kids	1
through	1
my	1
office	1
i	1
have	1
a	0
school	1
of	1
five	0
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	0
seven	0
kids	1

um-hum	0

five	1
hundred	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
good	1
solid	0
kids	1
and	0
i	1
have	0
the	0
same	1
thirty	0
seven	1
in	1
my	0
office	0
every	1
day	0

um	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
their	0
parents	1
are	1
totally	1
irresponsible	1
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
in	1
the	0
penal	1
system	0

so	0
that's	0
a	0
difficult	1
situation	1

and	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
just	0
see	0
those	1
kids	0
going	0
down	0
the	1
road	1
now	1
not	0
all	1
of	1
them_1	0
will	1
commit	0
offenses	1
that	0
have	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
capital	1
punishment	0
but	0
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
have	0
already	0
been	0
in	0
youth	1
centers	0
and	0
that	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	0
and	0

um	0

and	0
if	1
we	1
had	0
something	1
to	0
do	1
before	1
they	1
get	0
to	0
be	1
full	1
blown	0
adult	0
criminals	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
talking	1
about_1	0
necessarily	0
in	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
that	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
should	0
be	1
the	0
agent	0
of	0
all	1
the	0
social	1
action	1

um-hum	0

i	1
think	0
that's	0
one	1
reason	0
we	0
have	0
problems	1
in	0
school	0
sys[tems]	0
uh	0
and	1
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
our	1
problems	1
but	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
it's	0
because	1
everything	0
society	0
wants	1
we're	1
supposed	0
to	0
do	1

um-hum	1

but	1
that's	1
another	1
subject	0
but	1

well	0
that's	1
probably	0
true	1
wh[at]	0

anyway	1
i	1
dealt	0
with	1
two	0
or	1
three	0
kids	0
today	1
that	0
are	1
gonna	0
end	0
up	1
where	0
somebody	1
has	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
decision	1
what	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
them_1	0

hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
not	0
an	0
easy	0
solution	1
there's	0
there's	0
no	0
easy	0
solution	1
for	0
that	1

um-hum	0

i	1
don't	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
there	0
is	1
an	0
easy	0
solution	0
but	0
if	1
you	0
could	0
find	1
a	0
way	0
to	0
prevent	1
some	0
of	0
it	0
and	0
i'm	1
not	1
sure	0
what	1
it	0
would	0
be	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
money	1
better	0
spent	1
than	0

um-hum	0

do	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
costs	1
more	1
to	0
keep	1
an	0
inmate	1
on	1
death	1
row	1
than	0
it	0
does	0
to	0
send	0
a	0
kid	0
to	0
Harvard	1

that's	0
true	1

i'm	0
sure	0
it	0
is	1
yeah	1

statistically	1
that's	0
true	1

hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
certainly	1
capital	0
punishment	0
isn't	0
gonna	0
solve	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
problems	1
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0

are	0
you	1
for	0
it	0

uh	0

i'm	1
for	0
it	0
in	0
in	0
some	1
cases	1

i	0
guess	1
i	0
am	1
for	0
certain	0
cri[mes]	0
yeah	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
in	0
certain	1
crimes	0

what	0
kind	0
of	0
crimes	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
use	1
it	0
for	0

um	0
premeditated	1
murder	1
crimes	0
of	0
that	1
nature	0
i	1
think	0
should	0
definitely	1

um-hum	0

any	0
mass	1
murderer	1
type	0
individual	0

i	1
i	1
would	1
consider	1
it	0
for	0
sexual	1
abuse	0
of	0
children	1
on	1
going	1
you	1
know	0
not	1
one	0
instance	0
but	0
perpetual	1
abusers	0
of	0
children	0

hum	0

um-hum	0
well	0
you	0
always	1
have	1
[laughter-castration]	1

well	0
you	1
know	0
somebody	1
elected	1
that	0
recently	0

yes	1
i	0
read	1
about	0
that	1

and	0
all	1
the	0
civil	0
rights	1
people	0
are	0
up	0
in	0
arms	1
about	0
it	0
you	0
know	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0

i	1
don't	1
believe	1
that	1
we're	1

so	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
uh	1
the	1
recycling	1
programs	1
in	1
Atlanta	1
Julie	1

the	1
recycling	1
program	1
here	1
is	1
just	1
terrible	1
i	1
mean	1
it's	1
hard	1
to	1
find	1
places	1
to	1
go	1
i	1
mean	1
Kroger	1
does	0
a	1
couple	1
things	1
they	0
i	0
don't	1
think	1
they	0
do	1
they	1
do	1
newspapers	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
there's	1
there's	1
big	1
bins	1
out	1
there	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
if	0
they	1
ever	1
get	1
i	1
i	1
really	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
details	1
are	1
there	1
should	1
be	0
someplace	1
where	1
you	0
could	1
call	1
and	1
find	0
out	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
i'm	0
pretty	1
sure	1
there's	0
a	1
place	1
you	1
can	0
call	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
the	0
closest	1
you	1
know	1
thing	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
i	1
think	1
there	1
should	0
be	1
some	0
kind	0
of	1
curbside	1
service	1

yeah	1

that's	0
the	0
only	0
way	1
i	1
could	0
really	1

the	1
one	1
in	0
Florida	1
is	0
so	1
cool	1
because_1	1
they	1
pick	1
up	1
everything	1
they	0
pick	0
up	1
newspapers	1
and	0
uh	0
you	1
know	1
milk	1
jugs	1
and	1
aluminum	1
and	0
tin	1
cans	1
you	1
know	1
like	1
soup	1
comes	1
in	1
and	0
stuff	1

uh-huh	1

they	1
pick	0
up	1
everything	1

during	1
the	1
summers	1
like	1
the	0
around	1
where	1
i	1
live	1
the	1
uh	1
homeless	1
people	1
see[m]	0
i	0
mean	1
they	1
all	1
have	1
like	1
shopping	1
carts	1
and	1
stuff	1

um-hum	1

and	1
they'll	1
go	1
around	1
and	1
collect	1
cans	1
and	1
aluminum	1
stuff	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
just	1
save	1
them_1	1
up	1
and	1
then	1
they'd	1
come	0
around	1
and	1
we'd	1
give	1
them_1	1
to	0
them	1

um-hum	1

but	1
when	1
during	1
the	1
winter	1
time	0
i	1
think	1
they	0
they	1
move	0
south	1
or	1
something	0
so	0

yeah	1

so	0
i	1
don't	0
do	1
that	1
anymore	1
and	1
the	1
the	0
recycling	1
at	1
Georgia	0
Tech	1
like	0
that	0
um	1
outside	1
the	0
uh	0
student	1
center	0
they	0
never	1
empty	1
those	0
things	0

um-hum	1

i	0
know	1
it	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
it	1

they	0
just	1
overflow	1

it	1
piles	1
up	1

so	0
what's	1
a	0
guy	0
to	1
do	0
you	1
know	1
i	1
asked	1
myself	0

i	1
just	0
don't	0
know	0

i	0
just	0
don't	0
know	0
and	1
now	1
they	0
have	1
like	1
bins	1
and	0
stuff	1
that	0
are	0
a	0
little	0
more	0
convenient	1
because_1	0
mean	0
until	1
seven	0
o'clock	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
pay	1
to	0
park	1
at	0
the	0
student	1
center	1
you	0
can't	1
really	0
unload	1
all	1
your	1
stuff	1

really	1
huh	1
well	0
i	1
you	1
know	0
it's	0
true	1
hadn't	0
thought	1
about	0
that	0
that	1
is	1
very	1
inconvenient	1

i	0

inconvenient	1
even	1

i	0
know	1
it	0
i	0
know	1
oh	1

but	0
uh	0
so	0
you	1
do	1
recycle	1
don't	1
you	0

oh	1
yeah	0

yeah	1
i'm	0
kind	1
of	0
i'm	1
kind	1
of	0
bad	1
about	1
it	0

the	1

if	1
i	1
if	0
see	1
a	1
if	0
i	1
see	1
a	0
pile	1
of	1
cans	1
or	1
bottles	1
or	0
something	1
i'll	1
throw	1
it	1
in	1
there	0

um-hum	1

but	0
i	1
don't	0
really	0
i	1
don't	0
ever	0
take	1
anything	0

well	0
i	1
mean	0
it's	1
really	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
because	0
the	1
the	0
the	0
farmer's	1
market	0
recycles	0
absolutely	1
everything	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
since	0
we	0
go	1
there	0
all	0
the	0
time	0
i	0
mean	0

but	0
wait	1

probably	0
be	0
at	1
all	1

i've	1
never	0
seen	1
you	0
before	1

who	1
are	1
you	0

oh	0

well	1
is	0
there	1
anything	0
else	1
you'd	1
like	0
to	1
share	1
me	1
about	1
your	0
recycling	1
philosophy	1
Julie	1

i	1
just	0
think	0
that	0
everybody	1
ought	0
to	0
do	0
it	0

do	1
they	0
do	1
like	0
wh[at]	0
what	0
about	1
like	0
um	0
what	1
kind	0
of	0
plastic	1
stuff	0
can	0
you	0
recycle	1
do	0
you	0
know	1

the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	1
know	0
that	1
you	0
can	0
recycle	1
is	0
milk	1
jugs	0

really	1

yeah	1

what	0
about	1
like	0
those	0
grocery	1
bags	0

oh	0
yeah	1
they	1
have	0
uh	0
uh	0
what	1
i	0
what	0
i	0
used	1
to	0
uh	0
now	1
that	1
i	1
don't	0
go	1
to	0
the	1
grocery	1
store	0
much	1
it's	1
kind	0
of	0
moot	1
but	0
i	1
used	1
to	0
just	1
save	1
up	0
the	0
ones	1
that	0
i	0
got	0
one	1
time	1
and	1
then	0
go	1
and	0
hand	1
them_1	0
to	0
them_1	0
the	0
next	1
time	0
and	0
use	1
them_1	0
over	0
and	0
over	1

uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

an[d]	0
but	0
also	1
most	1
places	0
i	0
think	1
like	1
Big	1
Star	0
does	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
if	0
Kroger	1
does	0
or	1
not	1
but	0

they'll	0
ask	0
you	1
whether	0
you	0
want	0
bags	1
or	0
paper	1
or	0
plastic	1

yeah	1
and	1
they	0
they	1
have	0
like	0
little	0
little	0
boxes	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
put	0
your	0
old	0
bags	1
in	0

aha	0

can	0
bring	0
them_1	0
in	1

those	0
petroleum	1
products	0
are	1
gonna	1
kill	1
us	1

i	1
know	1
it	1
i	1
know	1
it	1

it's	0
hostile	1
planet	1
i	0
think	1
Julie	1

it	1
it	1
really	0
is	0
a	0
small	1
hostile	1
planet	1

the	1
petroleum	1
pretty	1
much	0
i	0
mean	0
those	0
petroleum	1
products	0
i	0
think	1
are	0
the	0
big	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
great	1
Satan	1
of	0
the	0
recycling	1

did	0
you	1
know	1
that	0

no	1
really	1
not	1
did	0

a	0
real	1
warm	1
movie	1

a	0
chance	1

i'm	0
in	1
for	1
it	1
we	0
rent	1
a	0
lot	1

we	0
we	0
often	1
sit	0
around	1
and	0
say	0
what	0
movies	1
should	0
we	0
rent	1

and	0
w[e]	0
don't	1
know	1

well	1
if	0
you	0
if	0
you	1
can	0
get	0
Green	1
Card	0
go	1
for	0
it	0

all	0
right	1
we'll	1
try	1
that	1
one	0

i	1
have	0
been	0
working	1
at	0
uh	0
as	0
an	0
accountant	1
at	0
the	0
medical	1
school	0
here	0
in	0
Dallas	1
and	0
i	1
have	0
watched	1
um	0
Gross	1
Anatomy	1
have	0
you	1
seen	0
that	1
one	0

yeah	1
i	0
did	1

okay	1
and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	0
can	0
associate	1
with	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
people	1
in	0
that	0
movie	1
because	1
of	0
the	0
young	1
students	1
i	0
see	1
over	0
at	0
the	0
medical	1
school	1
but	0
i	0
hope	1
you	0
have	0
a	0
very	1
merry	0
Christmas	1

you	1
too	1

i'm	0
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
it	1

i	1
think	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
white	1
Christmas	0
up	1
here	1
just	1
like	0
the	1
song	1
says	1

well	1

hello	1

hello	1

hi	1

this	1
is	1
Lois	1

hi	1
this	1
is	1
Lisa	1

and	1
um	1
i	1
called	1
you	1
know	1
from	1
that	1
the	1
the	1
TI	1
Database	1
Calling	1
Instructions	1

um-hum	1
yeah	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
call	0
yesterday	1
too	1
this	0
is	1
a	1
different	1
subject	1
though	1

yeah	1
this	1
is	1
about	1
changes	1
in	1
women	1
in	1
the	1

um-hum	1

uh	0
there's	1
really	1
a	1
lot	1
isn't	1
[laughter-there]	1
[laughter-i]	1

yeah	1

[laughter-i]	1
[laughter-mean]	1
there	0
really	1
is	1

[i]t's	1
kind	1
of	1
an	0
easy	1
thing	1
to	0
talk	1
about	1

oh	1
i	1
guess	1
the	1
work	1
force	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
main	1
wouldn't	1
it	1

yeah	1
um	1
i	1
think	1
you	0
have	1
to	1
push	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
can	1
start	1
recording	1
it	1

okay	1
all	1
right	1

okay	1

are	0
you	1
ready	1
now	1

yes	1

okay	1
like	0
i	1
said	1
i	1
guess	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
the	0
work	1
force	1
you	0
know	0
as	1
far	1
as	0
changes	1
in	0
the	0
generations	1

yes	1
i	1
know	1
because_1	1
i	1
know	1
when	0
my	0
mother	1
was	1
a	0
you	1
know	0
going	1
into	0
the	0
work	1
force	1
there	0
wasn't	1
very	1
many	1
opportunities	1
for	1
her	0
i	1
guess	1
she's	1
in	1
her	0
late	1
forties	1
you	0
were	1
expected	1
to	0
stay	1
home	1
and	1
take	0
care	1
of	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
i've	1
never	1
faced	1
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	1
no	1
i	1
think	1
n[ow]	1
now	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
work	1
when	1
they're	1
six	1
weeks	1
old	1
you	1
know	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
you	0
stay	1
there	0
and	1
i	0
feel	1
like	1
the	0
next	1
generation	1
you'll	1
probably	0
just	0
work	1
right	0
along	1
with	1
your	0
husband	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
um-hum	1
i	0
think	1
it's	0
definitely	1
gotten	0
better	1

oh	1
i	1
do	0
too	1
much	1
and	1
it's	1
just	1
gonna	1
get	1
better	1

um-hum	0

it	1
really	1
is	1

because_1	0
women	1
are	0
in	0
every	1
field	0
now	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
can't	1
think	0
of	0
a	1
field	1
that	0
they're	0
not	1
involved	0
in	1

oh	1
i	1
can't	1
either	1
not	1
a	1
one	1

i	1
know	0
at	0
least	1
in	1
the	0
medical	1
field	1
it	0
seems	1
like	1
they've	0
come	1
out	0
with	0
a	0
lot	1
further	1
advances	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
female	1
medications	1
and	0
things	1
since	0
women	1
have	0
gotten	1
into	0
the	1
doctor	1
field	0

um-hum	1

i	0
don't	0
think	1
that	0
men	1
really	0
took	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
work	1
on	0
that	0
[laughter-sort]	0
[laughter-of]	0
[laughter-thing]	1

yeah	0
even	1
in	0
Washington	1
you	0
know	1
there	1
seems	1
to	0
be	1
lot	1
more	1
women	1
involved	1

yeah	0

hopefully	1
the	0
next	1
generation	1
it	1
won't	1
even	0
be	0
an	0
issue	1
i	1
mean	0
people	1
will	1
just	1
look	1
at	1
you	0
as	0
a	1
person	1
and	0
not	1
as	0
a	0
man	1
or	0
a	0
woman	1
i	0

yes	1
yes	1

i	0
think	1
that	1
would	0
be	1
the	0
best	1
goal	1

oh	0
i	1
do	0
too	1
just	1
your	1
qualifications	1
and	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
it	1

uh-huh	0
exactly	1
not	0
what	0
color	1
you	0
are	1
how	0
old	1
you	0
are	1
what	1
if	0
your	0
male	1
or	0
female	1
that	1
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1
i	1
guess	0
it's	1
kind	1
of	1
an	0
ideal	1
world	0
though	0
huh	1

yeah	1
i	1
kind	1
of	1
think	1
maybe	0
in	1
time	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
you'll	0
go	0
by	1
social	1
security	1
numbers	1
you	0
know	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
that	0
way	1
they	0
can't	1
say	1
well	0
they	1
picked	1
the	0
male	1
over	0
a	0
female	1
or	0
female	1
over	0
a	0
male	1
you	0
know	1
you	1

exactly	1
or	0

the	0
more	1
that	0
you're	0
involved	1
in	0
that	1

um-hum	0
yeah	1
yes	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
great	1
i	0
really	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
look	0
for	0
more	1
of	1
that	1
in	0
the	0
next	1
generation	1

i	1
do	0
too	1
especially	1
as	0
women	1
get	0
up	0
in	0
management	1
and	1
and	1
can	0
be	1
in	0
on	0
those	0
decision	1
making	1
you	0
know	1
when	0
that	1
subject	1
comes	0
up	1
they	1
can	0
say	0
yes	1
that	0
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1

yes	1
oh	0
i	1
do	0
too	1

plus	1
i	0
bet	1
it	0
cuts	1
cuts	0
down	1
on	0
your	0
absenteeism	1
because_1	0
you've	0
got	1
two	0
days	0
off	1
that	1
you	0
can	1
do	1
everything	1
so	0
you	0
don't	0
have	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
unless	0
you're	0
just	0
really	1
sick	1
or	0
the	0
child's	1
sick	1

most	0
time	0
now	1
you	0
know	1
it's	1
just	0
a	0
weekend	1
or	1
just	1
forget	1
it	1

um-hum	0
oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	0
to	0
plan	1
way	0
in	0
advance	1
because	0
or	1
what	0
i've	0
done	0
is	0
found	1
like	0
doctors'	1
and	0
dentists'	1
office	0
with	0
extended	0
hours	1

uh-huh	0

that's	1
been	0
real	0
helpful	0
too	1
like	0
my	0
doctor	1
stays	0
open	0
till	0
nine	1
in	0
the	0
evening	1
so	0
that's	1
real	0
helpful	1
so	0
you	0
don't	1
you	0
know	1
have	0
to	0
do	0
it	1
during	0
office	1
hours	1
run	0
out	0
on	0
your	0
lunch	1
hour	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
many	0
times	1
i've	0
done	1
that	0
to	0
do	0
[laughter-something]	1
post	0
office	1
or	0
the	0
bank	1
or	0
any	1
uh	0
kind	0
of	0
errand	1

to	0
do	1
[laughter-yeah]	0

so	1

um-hum	0
yeah	1
i	1
think	1
we've	1
really	1
come	0
a	0
long	0
ways	1
in	1
that	1
because	1

uh-huh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
take	0
it	0
for	0
granted	1
kind	1
of	0
because_1	0
i	0
just	1
it's	0
always	0
been	1
that	0
way	1

um-hum	0

but	0
i	0
know	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
can	0
remem[ber]	1
remember	1
back	0
growing	0
up	1
my	1
mother	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
was	1
she	1
always	1
worked	1
but	0
it	1
wasn't	0
that	0
easy	1
for	0
her	1
to	0
just	0
take	0
off	1

oh	0
no	1
i	0
can	0
remember	1
my	0
mother	0
getting	1
in	0
trouble	1
if	0
you	0
know	1
one	0
of	0
us	0
was	0
sick	1
and	0
i	0
know	1
she	0
probably	0
didn't	0
make	1
hardly	0
anything	1
you	0
know	1
compared	0
to	0
the	0
work	1
that	0
she	0
did	1

oh	0
yes	1
um-hum	0
where	1
oh	1
yeah	1

i	0
think	0
there's	0
still	1
some	0
discrimination	1
there	1
where	0
as	0
you	0
know	0
men	0
and	0
wor[k]	1
women	1
work	0
in	0
the	0
same	0
job	1
i	0
think	0
men	1
get	0
paid	0
more	1

oh	1
i	1
do	0
too	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
that's	0
improving	1
it's	0
such	1
a	0
slow	0
process	1
it's	0
frustrating	1
but	0
mean	0
you	0
can	0
see	1
that	0
it's	0
wrong	1
and	0

yes	1
yes	0

and	0
you	0
just	1
wanna	0
make	0
it	0
right	1
but	1
at	0
least	1
the	0
wheels	0
are	0
moving	0
forward	1

they	0
really	0
are	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
getting	0
better	1
not	0
worse	1
well	1
i	0
should	0
probably	1
get	0
back	0
to	0
my	0
job	1

[laughter-i-]	1
[laughter-know]	0
[laughter-i]	1
know	0
the	0
feeling	1

call	1
again	1

okay	1
and	0
i	0
sure	1
will	1
and	0
bye-bye	1

okay	1
bye-bye	1

okay	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
puppy	1
you	1
got	1

well	1
uh	1
i	1
think	1
she's	1
mostly	1
German	1
Shepherd	1
uh	1
she	1
was	1
uh	1
uh	1
a	1
person	1
lives	1
across	1
the	1
street	1
from	1
me	1
uh	1
brought	1
her	1
home	1
from	1
work	1
because	1
a	1
coworker	1
of	1
hers	1
uh	1
had	1
this	1
dog	1
appear	1
on	1
its	1
front	1
doorstep	1
somebody	1

uh	1

somebody	1
somebody	1
abandoned	1
her	0
and	1
she's	1
only	1
about	0
oh	1
si[x]	1
between	1
six	1
and	1
eight	1
six	1
to	1
eight	1
weeks	1
old	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	1
uh	1
i	1
can't	0
understand	1
why	1
anyone	1
would	1
abandon	1
this	1
dog	1
though	1
she's	1

oh	1

she's	1
al[most]	1
i	1
mean	1
she's	1
that	1
this	1
young	1
and	0
she's	1
almost	1
housebroken	1

wow	1

i	0
mean	1
she	0
actually	1
asks	1
to	1
go	0
out	1

that's	1
great	1

and	1
uh	1
yeah	1
i	1
was	1
amazed	1

really	1
good	0
temperament	1
and	1
very	1
playful	1
and	1
affectionate	1
good	1
personality	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
i	0
can't	1
imagine	1
what	1
uh	1
would	0
have	0
been	1
wrong	1
with	1
this	0
dog	1
so	1

yeah	1
well	1
i	1
i	1
have	1
a	0
dog	1
that	0
God	1
gave	0
us	1
too	1

uh-huh	1

yeah	1
she	1
just	0
appeared	1

oh	1
really	1

yeah	1
my	1
husband	1
calls	0
her	0
street	1
dog	1
but	0
we've	1
had	1
her	0
now	0
for	0
about	0
three	1
years	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	1
just	0
you	1
get	0
so	1
attached	1
to	0
them	0

oh	1
yeah	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
uh	1
last	1
year	1
i	1
had	1
ano[ther]	1
i	0
had	1
another	1
German	1
Shepherd	1
now	1
this	1
one	0
was	1
purebred	1
and	1
uh	0
he	1
when	1
he	1
was	0
about	1
seven	1
months	1
old	1
got	0
a	0
gastrointestinal	1
virus	1
and	1
was	1
just	0
about	1
on	1
death's	1
door	1
but	1
uh	0
managed	0
to	1
get	1
him	1
to	0
a	0
veterinarian	1
in	1
time	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	0
and	1
on	0
huge	1
doses	1
of	0
antibiotics	1
and	1
he	1
actually	1
got	0
over	1
it	0
with	1
huh	1
seven	1
hundred	1
dollars	1
in	1
vet	1
bills	1

um	1

wow	1

um	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
actually	1
was	0
able	1
to	1
get	0
him	1
over	1
that	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
gaining	1
weight	1
again	1
was	1
just	1
getting	1
healthy	1
and	1
uh	0
he	1
put	1
on	0
about	1
fifteen	1
to	0
twenty	1
pounds	1
after	1
the	1
thing	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
got	1
hit	1
by	0
a	1
Cadillac	1

oh	1
no	1

[laughter-so]	1
i	1
couldn't	0
believe	1
it	0
that	1
was	1
that	1
was	0
really	1
hard	1

oh	1
gee	1

and	1
that	1
was	0
even	0
harder	1
though	0
for	1
i	0
was	1
on	0
a	1
business	1
trip	0
at	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
the	0
dog	1
was	0
being	1
house	1
sit	1
or	1
dog	1
sit	1
whatever	1
by	1
some	1
friends	1
of	1
mine	0
down	1
the	0
street	1
so	0

um-hum	1

so	0
they	1
just	0
felt	1
absolutely	1
awful	1

oh	1
i	0
bet	1

and	0
i	0
felt	1
felt	1
probably	0
worse	1
for	0
them	1
than	1
than	0
for	0
me	1
because	0
oh	0
gosh	1
they	1
the	1
uh	0
this	0
fellow's	0
wife	1
who	0
was	0
uh	0
watching	1
the	0
dog	1
pro[bably]	0
she	1
i	0
think	0
she	1
loved	1
that	0
dog	0
more	0
than	0
i	1
did	0
and	0
uh	0
she	0
was	0
jus[t]	0
really	1
attached	1
to	1
it	0

oh	1
gosh	1

but	1
uh	0
it's	0
it's	0
unfortunate	1
but	0
now	1
i've	0
got	1
another	0
one	0
so	0

yeah	1
yeah	1
how	1
long	1
has	0
it	0

the	0
switchboard	1

that	0
so	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
it's	0
nice	1
having	0
a	0
dog	1
here	0
uh	0
the	1

oh	1
yeah	1
there's	1
just	1

co[nditional]	0
unconditional	1
affection	0
from	1
the	0
from	0
the	0
[laughter-dog]	1

right	1

that's	1
it	1

yeah	1
yeah	1

really	1
not	1

really	1
wonderful	1

yeah	1
well	1
it's	0
been	0
nice	1
talking	0
to	0
you	0
we	0
seem	1
to	0
be	0
degenerating	1
here	0
so	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
i've	1
done	1
far	1
as	1
car	1
repairs	1
go	1
is	1
is	1
change	1
oil	1
and	1
filter	1
an	1
and	1
that	1
kind	1
of	0
stuff	1
i	1
haven't	1
gotten	1
really	1
involved	1
in	1
anything	1
uh	1
extensive	1
in	1
car	1
repairs	1
in	1
oh	1
oh	1
probably	1
a	0
year	1
or	1
so	0
i	1
think	0
the	0
last	1
thing	1
i	0
did	1
of	0
any	0
significance	1
was	0
change	1
the	1
water	1
pump	0
on	1
an	1
Oldsmobile	1

yeah	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
similar	1
thing	1
that	1
i've	1
worked	1
on	1
cars	1
ever	1
since	1
i	1
was	1
uh	1
a	1
kid	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
ago	1
but	1
i've	1
gotten	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
where	0
uh	1
the	1
newer	1
cars	1
are	1
getting	1
so	1
complicated	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
that	1
uh	1
oh	1
most	1
of	0
the	0
cars	1
i	1
buy	1
i	1
try	0
to	0
buy	1
as	1
simple	1
a	1
car	1
as	1
possible	1

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
mean	0

so	1
you	0
know	1
changing	1
the	0
oil	1
changing	1
the	1
spark	1
plugs	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
now	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
don't	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
ignition	1
stuff	1
anymore	1
because	1
that's	0
all	1
solid	0
state	1
or	1
or	1
fuel	1
injected	1
so	0

yeah	0
they're	0
fuel	1
injected	0
and	1
so	1
there's	1

so	0
there	1
goes	0
the	1
carburetor	0
and	1
if	1
the	1
fuel	1
injection	0
system	0
breaks	0
down	1
there's	0
no	1
way	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
work	1
on	0
that	1

yeah	1

no	1
there's	1
no	0
way	1
somebody	1
once	1
said	1
uh	1
i	1
had	1
a	0
car	1
that	1
said	1
fuel	1
injection	0
on	1
the	0
side	1
of	0
it	1
and	0
a	1
woman	1
asked	1
me	1
what	1
that	1
meant	1
and	1
i	1
said	1
that	1
means	1
that	1
i	1
can't	1
work	1
on	0
it	1

oh	1
yeah	1
yeah	0
basically	1
that's	0
it	1

you	0
know	1
they've	1
gotten	1
so	0
complicated	1
or	1
so	0
high	1
tech	1
that	0
uh	0
the	0
guys	1
average	0
guys	1
can't	1
really	0
go	0
out	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
garage	1
and	1
do	1
a	0
whole	0
lot	0
of	0
repairs	1
uh	0

yeah	0
i've	0
got	1
uh	1
an	0
eighty	1
four	1
Chevy	0
van	1
that's	1
uh	1
a	0
one	1
ton	0
van	1
with	1
a	0
camper	1
conversion	1
on	0
it	0

yeah	0

it's	0
got	1
the	0
the	1
the	0
good	1
old	0
three	0
fifty	1
standard	1
engine	1
in	0
it	0

absolutely	1

regular	0
gas	0
engine	0
and	0
that	1
engine	0
i	0
understand	1
i	0
can	1
i	0
can	0
actually	1
work	1
on	0
that	0
engine	1

yeah	0
i	1
used	1
to	0
have	1
uh	1
Chevy	1
van	1
it	1
was	0
a	0
short	1
van	1
that	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	1
in	0
it	0

yeah	0

uh-hum	0

and	1
basically	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
motor	1
and	0
you	1
didn't	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
junk	0
around	1
it	1

right	1

and	1
you	1
could	1
get	1
to	1
it	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
it	1

yeah	0
i	0
had	1
to	0
change	1
the	0
water	1
pump	0
in	0
that	1
here	1
about	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
and	1
it	0
was	1
really	1
fairly	0
easy	1
take	0
the	1
grill	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
radiator	1
out	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
just	0
stand	1
there	1
and	1
work	1
on	1
it	0

yeah	0
the	1
hardest	1
part	1
about	1
uh	1
water	1
pump	0
changes	1
is	0
getting	1
all	1
the	1
junk	1
off	1
before	1
you	0
can	1
get	1
too	1
it	1

well	1
that's	1
true	0
that	1
you're	0
right	0
you	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
time	0
you've	0
finally	1
got	0
down	1
to	0
it	1
i	1
was	0
hoping	1
i	1
could	0
remember	1
where	0
all	1
those	0
other	1
things	1
went	1

well	1
that's	1
kind	1
of	1
the	0
way	1
i	1
was	1
i	0
tried	1
to	1
remember	1
as	1
i	0
took	1
stuff	0
off	1
where	0
it	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
don't	1
think	1
i	0
had	0
too	1
many	1
nuts	1
and	0
bolts	1
left	1
over	1
when	0
i	0
got	1
it	0
all	0
put	1
back	1
together	1

a	1
few	0
years	1
ago	0
i	1
had	1
an	1
Oldsmobile	0
diesel	1
and	0
uh	1
the	0
uh	0
it	0
after	0
about	0
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	0
miles	1
the	0
injector	1
pump	0
went	1
out	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
uh	1
i	1
bought	1
it	1
when	1
we	0
were	1
living	1
in	0
Lubbock	1
when	1
i	0
came	1
back	1
here	1
i	1
brought	0
the	1
car	1
back	1
here	1
and	1
uh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
diesels	0
got	0
pretty	1
unpopular	0
and	0
you	0
couldn't	1
sell	1
the	0
thing	1
i	1
mean	0
though	0
for	1
what	1
you	1
could	1
get	1
for	1
one	1
you	0
might	1
as	1
well	1
drive	1
it	0
over	0
a	1
cliff	1

oh	0
yeah	1
yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
the	0
injector	1
pump	0
went	0
bad	1
so	0
i	1
found	1
an	0
outfit	1
down	0
here	0
to	0
rebuild	1
it	0
and	1
uh	0
i	1
reinstalled	1
that	1
and	0

and	0
that	1
was	0
probably	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
miserable	1
things	0
i	0
had	0
gotten	0
into	1
in	0
a	0
long	0
time	1

i	0
don't	1
think	1
i'd	0
know	0
where	1
to	0
start	1
with	0
a	1
diesel	1

uh	0
well	0
if	0
you	0
know	0
diesels	1
don't	0
require	0
mechanics	1
they	0
require	0
plumbers	0

well	0
that's	0
true	0

and	0
uh	0

i	1
think	1
the	0
onl[y]	1
closest	1
thing	1
i've	0
come	1
to	0
to	0
a	0
diesel	1
is	1
i've	1
worked	1
for	0
a	0
tractor	1
repair	0
shop	1
uh	1
when	0
i	0
was	1
in	0
high	1
school	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
used	1
to	0
overhaul	1
farm	1
tractors	0
basically	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	0
were	1
nearly	0
all	1
all	1
diesel	1
but	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
cars	1
i've	0
never	1
never	1
been	0
involved	1
with	0
them	0

well	0
the	0
injector	1
nozzle	1
and	0
stuff	0
in	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
big	1
diesel	0
farm	1
tractors	1
you	0
know	1
what	1
are	0
about	0
the	0
size	1
of	0
your	1
thumb	1
and	1
the	0

well	1
ye[ah]	1
yeah	0
and	1
you	1
ca[n]	1
you	1
can	0
get	1
to	1
them	0

yeah	0
you	0
can	0
get	1
to	0
them	1
and	0
the	0
ones	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
diesel	1
cars	1
were	0
little	1
tiny	0
things	1
and	0
just	0
almost	1
impossible	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
with	0

well	0
i	0

i've	0
had	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
good	0
service	1
out	0
of	0
that	0
car	1
but	0
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
finally	1
gave	0
it	0
to	0
my	0
son	1
and	0
he	1
drove	0
it	0
literally	1
into	0
the	0
ground	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

yeah	0

he	0
was	0
out	0
at	0
Tech	1
and	1
he	1
he	0
finished	1
it	1
off	1

i'm	0
i	1
guess	0
you're	0
right	1
the	0
the	0
diesel	1
has	0
almost	1
fallen	0
into	1
unpopular	1
status	1
i	1
don't	1
know	0
exactly	1
why	1
One	0
of	0
the	0
reasons	1
is	0
i	1
i'm	1
beginning	1
to	0
wonder	1
is	0
where	1
do	0
you	0
get	0
gas	1
at	0
i	0
su[re]	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
if	0
it's	0
still	1
uh	0
limited	1
like	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
don't	1
notice	1
it	0
probably	1
because	0
i	1
don't	1

what	0
the	0
availability	0

huh	0

you	0
mean	0
the	0
diesel	0
availability	0

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
notice	0
but	0
maybe	0
because	0
i'm	0
not	0
looking	1
for	0
it	0

yeah	0
well	0
i'd	1
bought	1
uh	0
a	0
GMC	1
diesel	0
pickup	1
and	1
uh	0
loved	1
that	1
thing	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
really	1
liked	1
it	0
but	0
it	0
turns	1
out	0
a	0
pickup	1
wasn't	0
what	0
i	0
really	1
needed	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
was	1
the	0
van	1
that	0
i	0
needed	0
then	1
to	0
buying	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
traded	1
it	0
in	0
on	0
the	0
Chevy	0
van	1
but	1
uh	0
i	0
sure	1
enjoyed	1
it	0

but	0
you	0
you	0
got	1
the	0
you	1
got	0
the	0
three	1
fifty	0
in	0
the	0
van	1

yeah	1
yeah	0
the	1
three	0
fifty	0
regular	1
gas	0
engine	1

yeah	0
that's	1
what	0
i	0
like	0
because	1
they've	0
got	1
plenty	0
of	0
power	1
and	1
uh	0
if	0
you	0
treat	1
them	0
right	1
they're	1
not	1
the	0
gas	1
guzzlers	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
they've	1
got	1
the	0
reputation	1
to	0
be	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	1
convinced	1
that	0
uh	0
Detroit	1
or	0
whoever	1
it	0
is	0
made	1
a	0
major	1
mistake	1
years	1
ago	0
when	1
they	0
stopped	1
putting	1
the	1
small	1
V	1
eights	1
in	1
and	1
went	1
to	0
the	1
fours	1
and	0
some	1
of	1
the	0
sixes	1

yeah	0
well	0

i'm	0
convinced	1
that	0
the	0
small	1
V	0
eight	1
like	1
the	1
the	0
Mustang's	1
original	1
two	1
eighty	1
nine	1
or	1
some	1
of	0
the	1
Chevy	1
two	1
eighty	0
threes	1
were	0
good	1
little	1
V	1
eight	0
engines	1
that	0
were	0
not	1
gas	0
guzzlers	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
they	0
had	1
enough	1
power	1
to	1
pull	1
all	0
this	1
weight	1

yeah	0

And	0
the	1
four	1
cylinders	1
just	1
don't	1
have	1
it	1

think	1
that	0
little	1
the	0
little	1
Chevy	1
V	0
eight	0
when	0
it	0
started	1
out	0
in	0
sixty	0
in	0
fifty	0
five	1
i	0
think	0
was	0
two	1
sixty	0
five	1
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

little	0
you	0
know	0
not	0
a	0
hold	0
lot	0
more	0
than	0
the	0
than	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
was	0
like	1
about	0
for	0
about	0
two	1
thirty	0
five	1
or	0
something	0
but	0
uh	0
they	1
kept	0
boring	1
that	0
block	0
out	1
to	0
where	1
you	0
could	0
a	0
get	1
a	0
four	1
hundred	1
small	1
block	0
four	0
hundred	1
that	0
was	1
uh	0
the	0
same	1
block	1
you	0
know	1
just	1
just	0
kept	0
boring	1
it	0
out	1
and	0
boring	1
it	0
out	1
and	0
stroking	1
it	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
yeah	0

i	1
think	0
those	1
g[uys]	0
those	1
little	0
V	1
eights	1
could	1
have	0
been	1
made	1
to	1
be	0
pretty	1
powerful	1
little	0
engines	1
if	0
they	0
would	0
have	1
gone	0
with	1
it	0
but	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
short	1
stroke	0
engine	1
it	0
could	0
really	0
wind	1
up	1

oh	1
yeah	1

the	0
two	1
little	0
cars	1
i've	0
got	0
now	1
bought	1
a	0
Mitsubishi	1
Mirage	0
here	0
a	0
couple	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
and	0
it	0
was	1
normally	0
carbureted	1
and	0
it's	0
fairly	1
easy	0
to	0
to	0
work	1
with	0
because	0
there's	0
not	1
just	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	1
in	1
it	0
to	0
go	0
wrong	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
changing	0
the	0
plugs	0
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
that's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	1

the	1
the	0
first	1
well	0
my	0
first	0
car	1
was	0
a	0
fifty	0
six	0
Mustang	1
and	0
uh	0
over	0
the	0
years	1
uh	0
all	0
i	1
had	1
a	0
uh	0
Dodge	1
pickup	1
several	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
uh	1
i	0
can't	0
remember	1
the	0
size	0
of	1
the	0
engine	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
three	0
O	1
seven	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
remember	1
working	1
on	0
those	1
cars	1
you'd	0
open	1
the	0
hood	1
and	0
there	1
was	0
basically	1
nothing	0
in	1
there	0
but	1
an	0
engine	1
and	0
a	0
few	1
things	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

Now	1
you	0
open	1
the	0
hood	1
and	0
it's	0
scary	0

yeah	0

like	0
you	0
say	1
it	0
takes	1
a	0
plumber	1
to	0
figure	0
out	1
where	0
all	0
this	0
stuff	0
goes	1

the	0
friend	1
of	0
ours	0
over	0
here	1
he's	0
got	1
uh	0
sixty	0
five	1
or	0
sixty	1
six	0
Mustang	1
with	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
look	0
under	0
the	0
hood	1
of	0
that	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
and	1
like	0
you	1
say	0
you	0
can	0
see	1
the	0
road	1

yeah	0

it's	0
amazing	0

well	1
if	1
you	0
had	1
to	0
you	0
could	1
climb	1
up	0
in	1
there	0
and	1
do	1
what	0
you	0
needed	1
to	0

you	0
could	1
yeah	1
you	0
could	0
stand	1
in	0
there	0
if	0
you	0
really	0
wanted	1
to	0
i	0
guess	1

my	0
dad's	0
got	0
a	0
new	1
um	0
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
an	0
eighty	1
nine	0
or	0
ninety	1
uh	0
Chrysler	1
something	1
or	0
other	0
it's	0
one	0
those	0
transverse	1
mounted	1
V	0
sixes	1
front	1
wheel	0
drive	1

oh	0
yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
he	0
was	0
showing	1
it	0
to	0
me	1
and	0
we're	0
looking	1
under	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
everything's	0
nice	0
and	0
clean	0
and	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
can	0
see	1
the	0
three	1
spark	1
plugs	0
there	0
in	0
the	0
front	1
And	0
i	0
said	0
well	0
where	0
are	0
the	0
other	1
three	0

and	0
he	0
had	1
never	0
really	0
thought	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	0

And	0
he	0
says	0
well	0
hopefully	1
i	0
won't	0
have	0
to	0
change	1
them	0
before	1
i	0
trade	1
it	0
off	1
Yeah	1
it's	0
going	1
to	0
be	0
a	1
problem	1
getting	0
back	1
there	0
because	0
it	0
was	1
shoved	1
right	0
up	0
against	1
the	0
fire	0
wall	1

yeah	0

so	0
they	0
just	1
about	0
complicated	1
the	0
things	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
shade	0
tree	0
mechanics	1
can't	1
do	0
much	1
with	1
them	0

yeah	0
well	0
when	0
they	0
went	1
to	0
the	1
started	1
with	0
the	0
newer	0
engines	1
you	0
know	0
when	0
they	0
started	0
putting	0
all	0
that	0
pollution	0
control	0
stuff	0
on	0
the	0
older	0
engines	0
is	0
where	0
they	0
started	0
getting	0
into	0
so	0
much	0
you	0
know	0
trouble	0
because	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	0
with	0
all	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
like	0
well	0
actually	0
i	0
guess	0
here	0
within	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	0
ago	0
anyway	0
was	0
the	0
last	0
i've	0
paid	0
any	0
attention	1
to	0
it	0
the	0
three	0
O	0
five	1
was	0
that	1
that	1
V	0
eight	1
that	0
they	0
put	1
in	0
the	1
the	0
three	0
quarter	1
and	0
and	0
half	1
ton	0
van	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
it	1
had	0
all	1
the	0
air	0
pump	1
and	0
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
all	1
that	0
all	1
that	0
stuff	1

right	0

yeah	0
the	0
antismog	0
pumps	0

and	0
all	0
the	0
antismog	0
stuff	0
and	0
uh	0
boy	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
really	0
a	0
mess	1
back	0
under	0
there	1
under	0
the	1
in	0
that	0
van	1

and	0
all	1
that	0
stuff	0
loads	1
the	0
motor	1
down	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

so	0
it's	0
trying	0
to	0
push	1
the	0
weight	1
plus	0
have	0
all	1
this	0
drain	1
on	0
it	0
from	0
all	0
sorts	1
of	0
belts	1
and	0
things	1
but	0
that's	0
one	1
good	0
thing	1
i've	0
got	1
a	0
uh	0
eight	0
ninety	1
uh	0
Chevy	1
Blazer	0
now	1
and	0
it's	0
got	0
one	1
uh	0
belt	1
on	0
it	0
a	0
serpentine	1
belt	1

oh	0
it's	0
that	1
one	1
that's	0
about	1
uh	0
what	0
an	0
inch	1
and	0
a	0
half	0
wide	1
got	0

yeah	0

got	0
a	0
bunch	0
of	0
groves	0
in	0
it	0

i	0
haven't	1
had	0
to	0
replace	1
the	0
thing	0
yet	1
it	0
looks	0
like	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
uh	0
better	0
than	0
having	0
i've	0
got	1
an	1
an	0
Olds	0
Tornado	1
that	0
i	0
think's	1
got	0
six	1
belts	1
on	0
the	1
sucker	1

yeah	0

And	0
i	0
had	1
to	0
get	0
all	1
those	0
off	1
you	0
know	0
when	1
i	0
was	0
replace	1
that	0
uh	0
water	1
pump	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
i	0
had	1
to	1
struggle	1
with	0
that	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
to	0
figure	0
which	1
belt	1
goes	0
where	1

yeah	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	0
the	0
inside	1
dual	1
on	0
a	0
truck	1
you	0
know	0
when	0
one	1
of	0
them	0
breaks	1
it's	0
not	0
the	0
outside	1
one	0
it's	1

oh	0
man	0

it's	1
it's	0
the	1
it's	0
usually	1
that	0
power	1
steering	0
belt	0
or	0
something	1
that's	0
way	1
back	0
in	0
there	1

you	0
bet	0
everything	1
else's	0
got	1
to	0
come	1
off	0
first	1

everything's	1
got	0
to	0
come	0
off	1

well	1
it's	0
a	0
pleasure	1
meeting	1
you	1

yeah	0
and	0
we'll	0
uh	0
how	0
many	0
times	1
have	0
you	0
done	1
this	0
now	1
is	0
this	0

uh	0
i've	1
got	1
uh	1
five	1
stickers	0
here	1
from	0
TI	1
so	1
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
done	1
probably	1
uh	1

or	0
or	0

if	0

winding	1
down	0
or	0

a	0
difficult	0
time	1
the	0
past	0
couple	1
of	0
times	0
of	0
getting	1
uh	0
answers	1

finding	0
a	0
taker	0

so	0

fifteen	0
minutes	0
at	0
a	0
time	1
so	1
people	1
or	0

thanks	0
for	0
talking	0

okay	0
all	0
righty	0
bye-bye	0

so	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
any	1
painting	1
projects	1
lately	1

yeah	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
topic	1
for	1
me	1
because_1	1
i	1
just	1
did	1
my	1
first	1
two	1
painting	1
projects	1
ever	1
it	1

oh	1
really	1

was	1
not	1
not	1
a	1
big	1
deal	1

what	1
kind	1
of	1
painting	1
was	1
it	1

two	1
little	1
deals	1

the	1
first	1
one	0
um	1
i	1
helped	1
someone	1
repaint	1
an	1
apartment	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
easy	1

uh-huh	1
it	1
was	1
it	0

yeah	1
and	1
i've	1
never	1
painted	1
anyth[ing]	1
i	1
always	1
thought	1
it	0
would	0
be	1
so	1
you	1
know	1
you'd	1
have	1
to	1
hire	1
someone	0
if	1
you	1
needed	0
to	1
paint	1
inside	1
your	1
house	1
or	1
something	1
but	1

yeah	1

but	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
it	1

oh	0
huh	1

and	1
the	1
second	1
one	1
was	1
i	1
bought	1
some	0
toys	1
at	0
a	1
um	1
at	1
a	1
craft	1
fair	0

uh-huh	1

they're	1
unfinished	1
wooden	1
book	1
ends	1
and	1
stuff	1
for	1
a	0
a	0
little	0
girl	1
for	0
Christmas	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
just	1
decided	0
to	0
paint	1
them	1
and	0
that	1
wasn't	0
as	0
easy	1
as	0
painting	1
the	0
[laughter-apartment]	1
[laughter-was]	1

oh	0
w[ell]	0
what	1
kind	0
of	0
paint	1
did	1
you	0
use	1
for	0
the	0
um	0
bookends	1

well	1
it's	1
uh	1
it	1
that's	1
half	1
the	1
problem	1
right	0
there	1
is	1
that	1
it	0
wasn't	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
oil	1
base	0
so	0
i	1
had	1
to	0
get	0
and	1
when	1
i	1
painted	1
them_1	1
i	1
didn't	0
realize	1
that	1
we	0
didn't	0
have	1
any	0
uh	1
turpentine	1
or	0
paint	1
thinner	0
or	1
anything	0
in	1
the	0
house	1
so	1
i	0
had	0
it	1
had	1
it	0
all	1
over	0
my	1
hands	1
at	0
first	1
i	0
didn't	0
realize	0
you	0
know	0
i	1
had	0
never	0
painted	0
anything	1
so	0
i	0
didn't	0
realize	1
that	0
i	0
needed	1
that	0
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
kind	1
of	0
knew	0
in	0
the	0
back	1
of	0
my	0
mind	1

so	1
you	0
can't	1
use	0
oil	1
on	0
wood	1

well	1
no	1
you	1
can	1
use	0
it	1
on	0
wood	1
but	0
i	0
just	0
had	1
it	0
all	0
over	0
my	0
hands	1
and	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
wash	0
the	0
brushes	1
out	0
and	0
uh	0
wash	0
my	0
hands	1
and	0
you	0
can't	1
wash	0
it	0
off	0
with	0
water	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
get	0
the	0
uh	0
a	0
solution	1
and	0

oh	0
so	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
go	0
around	1
with	0
paint	1
all	0
over	0
you	0
temporarily	1
anyway	0

yeah	1
i	1
had	0
to	1
drive	1
to	0
the	0
store	1

yeah	1
i	0
had	1
to	0
drive	0
to	1
the	1
store	1
with	1
paper	0
towels	1
all	0
over	0
my	0
hands	1
to	0
go	0
buy	1
some	0
paint	0
thinner	0
and	0
right	1
back	1
and	0
everything	1
like	0
that	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0
then	0
um	0
uh	0
downstairs	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
apartment	1
i	0
just	0
use[d]	0
we	0
just	0
used	1
a	0
latex	1
base	1
and	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
drip	1
it	0
on	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
dripped	1
it	0
on	0
something	0
as	0
long	0
as	0
you	0
wiped	1
it	0
up	1
it	0
was	0
real	0
easy	1
to	0
clean	0
up	0

oh	0
is	0
that	1
what	0
you	0
usually	1
use	1
in	1
the	0
house	1
is	0
latex	1

yeah	1
and	0
and	1
it	0
it	1
just	0
like	1
the	1

hm	0

the	1
same	1
with	0
the	0
toys	1
it's	0
just	0
important	1
to	0
look	1
for	0
one	0
that	0
doesn't	0
have	0
lead	1
in	0
it	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
says	0
safe	1
for	0
children	1
and	0
all	0
that	1

uh-huh	0
yeah	0
heard	1
about	0
that	1
i	0
guess	0
a	0
friend	1
of	1
mine	0
had	1
a	1
uh	0
um	0
well	0
she	1
she	1
just	1
started	0
up	1
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0
and	1
uh	0
an[d]	0
the	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
real	1
strict	0
uh	0
restrictions	1
was	0
the	0
fact	1
that	0
she	1
had	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
special	1
kind	0
of	0
paint	1
that	0
was	1
fire	1
proof	1
and	1
lead	1
free	1
and	0
all	0
that	0
other	1
good	1
stuff	0

yeah	0

so	0
uh	0
she	1
had	0
that	1
done	0
but	0
uh	0

have	0
you	0
painted	1
anything	0
recently	1

well	1
um	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
i	1
had	0
to	1
paint	1
this	1
uh	1
the	0
inside	1
of	0
this	0
warehouse	1
thing	1
uh	0
that	0
you	0
keep	1
some	0
um	0
farm	1
equipment	0
in	0

wow	1
was	0
it	0
huge	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
um	1
what	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
just	0
coat	1
this	0
bare	1
wood	1
with	0
a	1
sealer	1
and	1
uh	1
i	0
had	1
this	1
big	0
five	1
gallon	1
jug	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
like	1
paint	1
thinner	0
i	1
mean	0
i	1
you	1
know	0
it	1
looked	1
just	1
like	0
it	0
was	1
the	0
viscosity	1
of	0
paint	1
thinner	0

yeah	1

but	1
uh	0
you	0
just	1
took	1
a	0
roller	1
and	0
put	0
it	1
on	1
there	0
and	1
uh	0
if	0
you	1
saw	1
that	1
the	0
wood	1
was	0
getting	0
wet	1
you	0
know	1
that	1
was	0
that	0
was	1
all	0
you	1
needed	1
so	0

wow	1

yeah	1
it	0
was	0
it	0
used	1
all	1
of	0
it	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
about	1
three	1
hundred	1
yards	1
worth	0
so	1
well	1
i	1
guess	1
it	1
worked	1
out	1
it	1
was	0
pretty	1
easy	1
actually	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
though	1
um	0
we're	0
lucky	1
that	0
we	0
didn't	0
have	0
to	0
do	1
any	0
detail	1
work	0
because_1	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
if	0
i	0
could	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0

i	0
don't	0
know	1
must	1
be	0
difficult	1

well	1
what	1
about	1
the	0
trim	1
in	0
your	0
house	1
did	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
do	0
that	1

no	0
it	0
was	0
j[ust]	0
it	0
was	1
really	0
easy	1
i	0
just	1
like	0
what	0
i	0
we	0
had	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
different	1
size	0
brushes	1
and	0
it	0
wa[s]	0
you	1
know	0
real	0
easy	1
i	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
went	0
around	0
the	0
trim	1
and	0
if	0
i[t]	0
and	0
there	0
was	0
wallpaper	1
like	0
i	0
was	0
do[ing]	0
just	0
doing	1
just	0
the	0
trim	1
of	0
the	0
around	0
the	0
doors	0
and	0
windows	1
and	0
there	0
was	0
wallpaper	1
and	0
if	0
we	0
got	0
it	0
on	0
the	0
wallpaper	1
a	0
little	0
bit	1
we	0
just	0
wipe	1
it	0
right	0
away	1
before	0
it	0
dried	1
it	0

um-hum	1

it	0
came	0
right	1
off	1
so	1

oh	0
yeah	0

so	1
there	0
was	0
no	1
major	1
mistakes	0
there	0
was	0

did	0
you	0
have	1
uh	1
one	1
coat	0
or	0
two	1

uh	0
two	1
actually	1

um-hum	1

um	0
and	0
it	0
there	1
was	0
um	1
you	0
know	1
around	0
the	0
windows	1
if	0
you	0
got	0
it	1
on	0
the	0
glass	1
we	1
let	0
it	1
dry	1
and	0
scraped	1
it	0
after	0
that	1
but	0
that	0

yeah	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
really	1
time	1
a	0
a	1
time	1
saver	1

well	1
yeah	1
if	0
you	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
we	0
didn't	0
tape	1
anything	0

we	0
weren't	1
that	0
careful	1
but	0
it	0
wasn't	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
it's	0
it's	0
funny	1
it's	0
like	0
if	0
you	1
just	0
go	1
slow	1
you	0
don't	1
get	0
or	0
at	0
least	0
i	1
didn't	1
get	1
that	0
many	1
mistakes	1
i	0

um-hum	0

i	0
didn't	0
make	1
that	0
many	0
mistakes	0

oh	0
me	1
i	1
would've	0
had	1
to	0
have	0
taped	1
the	0
whole	1
thing	1
and	1
then	1
brushed	1
around	1
the	0
edges	1
and	1
and	1
then	1
i'd	0
have	1
probably	0
rolled	1
it	1
on	0
i'd	0
uh	0
it	1
would've	0
taken	1
me	1
forever	1

why	1
just	0
because	0
you'd	0
be	0
afraid	1
to	0
do	0
it	0
or	0
have	0
you	0
done	1
it	0
be[fore]	0

yeah	1
well	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
it'd	1
probably	0
would've	1
tooken	1
me	0
forever	1
so	0

well	1
it	0
wasn't	1
if	0
it	0
was	0
my	0
own	1
i	0
would've	1
but	0
my	0
friend	1
said	0
oh	0
just	0
go	0
ahead	1
you	0
just	0
go	0
ahead	1
it's	0
easy	1
i	0

i	0
said	0
okay	1
it's	0
your	0
place	1

well	1
how	0
long	1
did	1
it	1
take	1
y'all	0

well	1
a	0
couple	1
of	0
weekends	1
we	0
would	0
go	0
down	1
two	0
or	0
three	0
hours	1
on	0
the	0
weekends	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0

so	0
there	0
was	1
two	0
of	0
y'all	1

no	1
there	0
was	0
they	1
were	0
doing	0
all	1
sorts	1
of	0
repairs	0
and	0
there	0
was	0
i	0
was	0
just	0
painting	1
because_1	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
how	0
to	0
do	1
anything	0
[laughter-else]	1
so	0

well	0
that's	1
easy	0
enough	1

so	0
there's	0
a	0
whole	1
bunch	0
of	0
people	0
yeah	1

um	0

so	0
now	1
i	0
feel	0
like	0
if	0
i	0
ever	0
buy	0
a	0
house	1
i	1
can	1
probably	0
paint	1
if	1
nothing	0
else	1

i	1
think	0
i	0
could	0
probably	1
do	0
it	1
uh	0
as	0
long	1
as	0
the	0
hardware	1
store	0
told	1
me	0
what	0
to	1
buy	1
then	1
i	0
could	0
do	0
it	0

yeah	1

but	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
went	0
in	1
to	0
a	0
hardware	1
store	0
to	0
get	0
paint	1
for	0
those	0
toys	1
and	0
the	0
guy	1
said	0
oh	0
get	0
this	1
it's	0
a	0
nice	1
shiny	0
gloss	1
which	0
was	0
true	1

but	1
i	0
didn't	0
realize	0
what	0
you	1
know	0
a	0
pain	1
it	0
is	0
to	0
clean	0
the	0
brushes	1
and	0
everything	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
latex	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
worth	1
the	0
shi[ne]	0

um-hum	0

okay	1
well	1
like	1
i	1
was	1
saying	1
Burlington's	1
crime	1
it	1
doesn't	1
involve	1
children	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
see	1
on	1
the	1
TV's	1
from	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
Washington	1
and	1
New	1
York	1
so	1
what	1
i	1
believe	1
the	1
people	1
want	1
the	1
subject	1
is	1
is	1
big	1
city	1
crime	1
which	1
is	1
something	1
that	0
i	1
don't	1
have	0
any	1
first	1
hand	0
experiences	1
about	1
but	0
i	1
have	1
you	1
know	0
concerns	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
ideas	1
of	1
um	0
how	1
to	0
combat	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
don't	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
uh	0
ideally	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
need	0
money	1
to	0
do	1
everything	1
so	0
that's	0
one	1
thing	1
that	1

um-hum	1

that	1
that's	1
one	1
thing	1
that	0
that's	1
that's	0
crime	1
that	0
you	1
can't	1
fight	1
it	0
if	1
you	1
need	1
that	1
money	1
so	1

right	1
yeah	0
well	1
when	1
uh	1
we	1
lived	1
in	1
San	1
Antonio	1
i	1
grew	1
up	0
around	1
San	1
Antonio	1
and	1
it's	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
uh	1
city	1
and	1
increasingly	1
growing	1
it's	1
has	1
kind	0
of	1
the	0
split	1
population	1
um	1
there's	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
retired	1
military	1
uh	0
individuals	1
that	1
live	1
there	0
and	1
then	1
there's	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
Hispanic	1
population	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
thing	0
that	1
we	1
noticed	1
that	1
over	1
the	1
years	1
has	1
gotten	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
is	1
Hispanic	1
uh	1
gang	1
crime	1
in	1
the	0
city	1

oh	1

and	1
that	1
is	0
uh	0
been	1
the	1
worse	1
thing	1
that	1
we've	0
seen	1
happening	1
uh	1

does	1
it	1
spread	1
out	1
of	1
the	0
neighborhoods	1
into	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
uh	0
retired	1
people's	1
community	0
or	1
does	1
it	0
stay	1
in	1
the	0
bad	1
neighborhood	1

um	1
the	0
majority	1
of	1
the	1
actual	1
gang	1
crimes	1
like	1
the	1
the	0
drive	1
by	1
shootings	1
and	1
stuff	1
stays	1
in	1
the	1
neighborhoods	1
but	0
the	1
crime	1
spreads	1
out	0
into	1
the	1
more	1
affluent	1
uh	1
divisions	1
through	0
robberies	1
rape	1
and	1
uh	0
car	1
crime	0
there's	0
a	1
very	1
large	1
uh	0
or	1
very	1
high	1
percentage	0

San	1
An[tonio]	1
San	0
Antonio's	1
not	0
far	1
from	1
the	0
border	1
to	1
Mexico	1
so	1
a	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
uh	1
cars	1
go	0
to	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
hack	1
shops	0
and	0
they	0
take	1
them_1	0
apart	1
and	0
a	0

go	0
over	0

when	1

get	1
in	0
their	0

since	1
then	0
when	0
you	0
drive	1
into	0
the	0
city	1
most	0
people	1
keep	0
their	0
doors	0
locked	1
while	0
they're	0
in	1
the	0
car	0
until	1
they	0
get	0
down	1
there	0
and	0

and	0
um	0
you	1
