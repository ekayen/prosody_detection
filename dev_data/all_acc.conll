so	1
much	0
uh	0

you	0
can't	0
put	0
it	0
in	0
pictures	1

a	1
little	1
library	1
of	0
books	1
that	1
i	1
just	0
like	0
to	1

one	0
of	1
them	0

ever	1
seen	0
in	1
your	0

the	0
story	1
of	0
this	0
little	1
cat	1
and	0
dog	1
and	1
it's	1
not	0
like	1

just	1
uh	1
it's	1
just	1
so	1
realistic	1
everything	1
they	0

you	1
wonder	0
how	1
in	1
the	0
world	1

got	0
them	0
to	1

of	1
these	0

it	0
would	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
good	1
show	1

it's	0
hard	1
to	0
know	1
what	1
the	0
good	1
movies	0
are	1
anymore	0
because	0

yeah	0

because	0
sometimes	1
the	0
reviews	1
you	0
just	0
can't	1
go	1
by	0
and	0

yeah	0
i	0
i	0
use	0
they	0
they	0
they	0
have	1
all	0
these	0
neat	1
phrases	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
like	0
critically	1
acclaimed	1

yeah	0

that's	1
what	0
they	0
say	1
when	0
the	0
thing	1
hasn't	0
won	1
any	0
award	1

oh	0
i	0
see	0

you	0
know	0
they	0
can't	0

it's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	0
waterfront	1
property	1
or	0
something	1
if	0
you're	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
you're	0
two	1
miles	0
away	1
from	0
water	0

yeah	0
yeah	0

yeah	0
from	0
love	0
canal	0

water	0
view	0

waterfront	0
property	0
here	0
at	0
love	0
canal	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	0

but	0
you	0
know	0
critically	0
acclaimed	0
oh	0
good	0
grief	0
give	0
me	0
a	0
break	0

that's	0
wh[at]	0
i	0
mean	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
reasons	1
why	1
i	0
don't	0
go	0
to	0
movies	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
primarily	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
now	0
i'm	0
probably	1
going	0
to	0
going	0
to	0
upset	1
you	0
but	0
people	1
who	0
bring	1
kids	1
irritates	1
the	0
heck	1
out	0
of	0
me	0

uh	1
being	1
a	1
former	1
drug	1
user	1
i	1
uh	1
i'd	1
i	1
guess	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
that	1
i	0
do	1
approve	1
of	1
it	1

whoa	1

uh-huh	1

uh	1
because	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
uh	1
in	1
using	1
drugs	1
i	1
was	0
not	1
a	1
good	1
employee	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
so	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
from	1
the	1
company's	1
standpoint	1
that	1
there	1
uh	0
whenever	1
you	0
are	1
an	0
employee	1
of	0
the	0
company	1
you	0
are	0
using	1
it's	0
assets	1
and	1
uh	0
a[nd]	1
bu[t]	1
you're	0
also	1
under	1
their	0
liability	1
under	1
the	1
workmen's	1
comp	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
on	0
my	1
job	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
lot	0
of	1
workmen's	1
comp	0
cases	1
and	1
uh	0
i	0
work	1
for	0
a	0
tire	1
company	1
modern	1
tire	1

where	1
do	0
you	0
work	1

oh	1

and	1
uh	0
it's	0
also	1
a	0
retreading	1
plant	1
and	0
that's	1
where	0
most	0
of	0
our	1
uh	0
injuries	1
occur	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
what	1
we	1
do	1
is	0
we'll	0
have	1
a	0
drug	1
test	0
i[f]	0
if	1
an	1
if	1
a	1
a	0
boy	1
or	0
a	1
man	1
uh	1
has	1
an	0
accident	1
then	1
he's	1
automatically	1
uh	0
given	0
a	0
drug	1
test	1

right	1
do	0
they	0
do	1
it	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
within	0
hours	1
of	0
the	0
accident	1
or	0
is	0
it	1

yes	1
when	0
he	0
goes	1
to	0
the	0
doctor	1
the	0
first	0
time	1

yeah	0

and	1
so	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
uh	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
if	0
it's	0
been	1
a	1
deterrent	1
or	0
not	1
because	0
we	1
have	0
uh	0
just	1
started	0
using	1
it	1
oh	1
for	0
the	0
past	0
year	1
or	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

now	0
we've	1
let	1
some	0
people	0
go	1
uh	0
that	0
well	0
it	0
was	0
found	0
that	0
drugs	1
were	0
used	1
in	1
their	0
system	1
now	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
how	1
tec	1
would	1
handle	1
it	0
they	1
haven't	0
pursued	1
it	1
you	1
know	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
if	0
there's	1
some	1
uh	0
problem	1
i	0
know	1
there	1
was	0
one	1
guy	1
that	0
we	1
tested	1
for	0
preemployment	1
for	0
drugs	1
who	1
absolutely	1
swore	1
up	0
and	0
down	1
that	1
it	0
showed	1
that	0
he	0
was	0
using	1
amphetamines	1
and	0
he	1
went	0
to	1
a	0
a	1
separate	1
drug	0
testing	1
firm	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
they	1
showed	0
it	1
negative	1

huh	1

so	1
i	1
think	1
the	0
tests	1
themselves	1
are	1
not	1
really	1
that	1
cut	1
and	1
dried	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
probably	0
true	1
too	1
that's	1
that's	1
that's	1
sort	0
of	0
scary	1

uh-huh	1
really	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
also	1
had	0
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	1
uh	0
just	0
around	1
some	0
people	1
that	1
were	1
smoking	1
cocaine	1

yeah	1

and	0
he	1
tested	0
positive	0
on	1
cocaine	1
now	1
then	1
you	0
always	1
wonder	1
well	1
is	0
he	1
just	1
saying	0
that	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
yeah	1
really	1
really	1

yeah	0

yeah	1
that's	1
that's	1
a	0
bad	1
situation	1
i	1
think	0
that	0
probably	1
i	1
think	0
most	1
companies	0
now	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
entry	1
you	1
know	0
exams	1
require	1
that	0
i	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

i	1
think	0
they	0
should	1

uh-huh	1

i'm	1
a	0
ti	1
employee	1
and	1
and	1
and	1
uh	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
really	0
gung	1
ho	0
for	1
it	0
in	0

uh-huh	0

in	0
fact	1
i	1
you	0
know	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
places	1
now	1
um	0
like	0
ibm	1
don't	1
allow	1
even	0
smoking	1
you	1
know	0
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
plant	1

uh-huh	0

right	1

we	1
we	1
have	0
designated	1
smoking	1
areas	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	0
i	0
work	1
in	0
sort	1
of	0
a	0
building	1
that's	1
that's	0
not	1
really	1
it	1
well	0
it's	0
on	1
the	0
campus	1
of	0
the	0
ti	0
facility	1
but	0
it's	0
a	0
little	1
bit	1
you	1
know	0
separated	1
we	0
lease	1
the	0
building	1
and	1
it's	1
m[ainly]	1
it's	0
a	1
factory	1
environment	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
they	1
they	0
have	0
designated	1
smoking	1
but	0
it's	0
just	1
wide	1
open	1
it's	0
not	1
ventilated	1
properly	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
think	1
that's	0
bad	1
but	0
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	0
drugs	1
you	1
know	0
being	1
in	0
the	0
factory	1
kind	1
of	0
environment	1
that	0
way	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
a	0
it's	1
a	1
definite	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
essential	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

yeah	1
because	1
you're	1
endangering	1
everybody's	1
lives	1
if	1
you've	0
if	0
it's	0
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	1

in	1
fact	1
we've	0
had	1
the	0
policy	1
on	0
just	0
the	1
random	1
testing	1
now	1
for	1
a	0
couple	1
years	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
was	1
giving	1
my	0
boss	1
a	0
hard	0
time	1
because	1
i	1
kept	0
waiting	1
for	0
my	0

came	1
come	1
up	1
you	1
know	0
they	1

they	1
never	1
they	1
never	1
called	1
me	1
they	1
never	1
you	1
know	0
then	0
finally	1
the	0
day	1
we	1
declared	0
war	1
was	0
my	1
time	1

[laughter-you're]	1
kidding	1

[laughter-no]	1
and	1

and	1
and	0
my	1
boss	1
has	1
has	1
gone	1
for	1
about	0
like	1
three	1
times	1
i	1
think	1
and	0
i	0
told	1
him	1
he's	0
obviously	1
in	0
a	0
high	1
risk	0
group	1

the	1
executives	1
right	1

right	1
right	1
and	0
of	0
course	1
you	1
know	0
they	1
they	0
did	1
specifically	1
single	0
them	1
out	0
when	0
we	0
started	1
you	1
know	0
that	0
they	1
were	0
going	0
to	0
do	1
all	0
them	0
first	1

the	0
executives	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
wouldn't	1
that	0
be	0
awful	1
if	0
you	1

if	1
you	1
were	0
using	1
and	1
and	1
oh	1

my	0
lord	1
and	0
savior	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
don't	1
use	0
drugs	0

uh	0
marijuana	1
cocaine	1

really	1
downward	1
spiral	1

life	1
is	0
so	1
much	0
more	0
enjoyable	1

uh-huh	0
and	0
i	1
was	0
losing	1
jobs	1
just	0
from	0
doing	0
a	0
poor	1
job	1
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
that's	1
that's	0
it	1

i	0
mean	1
you	1
know	1
there's	1
all	0
kinds	1
of	0
drawbacks	1
much	1
less	1
the	0
drug	1
testing	1

yeah	1
just	0
life	1
in	0
general	1

uh-huh	0
that's	0
right	1

yeah	1
well	0
i'm	0
well	0
i'm	1
definitely	1
for	1
it	0

yeah	1

plus	1
you	0
know	1
you	1
you	0
want	1
to	0
think	1
that	1
that	0
you're	0
working	1
with	0
people	1
who	1
are	0
not	0
only	0
putting	1
out	0
their	0
fair	0
share	1
but	0
that	0
are	0
not	1
endangering	1
your	0
life	1
in	0

that's	0
right	1

in	0
some	0
cases	1
like	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	1

like	1
uh	0
my	0
husband	1
uh	0
several	1
years	0
back	1
worked	0
for	0
motorola	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	1
had	1
you	0
know	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
was	1
a	0
chemical	1
handling	1
type	1

oh	0
goodness	1

yeah	1
i	0
mean	1
and	0
they	0
have	1
they	1
have	0
some	0
serious	1
chemicals	1
out	0
there	1
you	1
know	0
like	1

yeah	1

like	1
they	0
have	1
emergency	1
shower	1
where	0
you	0
just	0
run	1
in	0
there	1
and	0
strip	1
off	1
and	0
dump	1
water	1
you	1
know	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1

yeah	1

and	0
they	1
had	0
people	0
out	0
there	1
using	0
all	0
sorts	1
of	0
drugs	1
handling	1
those	0
chemicals	1

oh	1
my	0
gosh	1

you	0
know	0
that's	1
really	1
that's	1
really	0
frightening	1
so	0

yeah	1

so	0
i	1
think	0
some	0
place	1
you	1
know	0
places	1
like	0
that	1
it	0
should	0
be	1
like	1
mandatory	1
like	1
you	1
know	0
on	0
on	1
a	0
on	0
a	0
greater	1
frequency	1
than	1
than	0
maybe	1
just	0
you	1
know	0
the	1
paper	0
pushers	1
like	1
like	0
i	1
am	0

uh-huh	1

right	1

i	0
would	0
think	1
they	0
would	1
be	0

well	1
you	0
well	1
you'd	0
think	1
so	1
but	1
uh	1

but	1
they	0
weren't	1

i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
[un]til	0
yet	1

isn't	1
that	0
awful	1

because	1
when	0
he	1
was	0
at	0
course	1
now	0
it's	1
been	0
years	1
now	0
because	0
it	1
was	0
before	1
it	1
was	0
even	0
before	1
they	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
designated	1
smoking	1
type	0
stuff	1
you	0
know	0
at	0
ti	1
i	0

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

i	0
forgot	0
what	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
like	1
eighty	1
four	1
eighty	0
five	1
something	1
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	1
at	0
that	1
time	1
they	1
had	0
no	0
testing	1
whatsoever	1

huh	0

so	1
that's	1
scary	1

yeah	1
that's	1
reminds	1
me	0
of	0
uh	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
friend	1
who	0
was	0
telling	0
me	0
about	0
her	0
brother	1
who	0
gets	0
high	1
all	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
i	0
have	1
just	0
casually	1
asked	1
her	0
what	0
he	0
did	0
for	0
a	0
living	1
and	0
she	1
said	1
oh	0
he's	0
the	0
supervisor	1
of	0
this	0
chemical	1
land	1
fill	0
you	0
know	1
where	0
they	0
go	1
and	0
dump	1
all	0
this	1
toxic	1
stuff	1

oh	1
lord	1

oh	1

and	1
i	0
just	1
you	0
know	1
went	0
oh	1
[laughter-where]	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
yeah	1
should	0
we	0
move	1

let	1
me	0
move	1
as	0
far	1
away	0
as	0
possible	1

ooh	1

yeah	1

that's	0
awful	1

but	1
i'm	0
proud	1
though	0
that	1
that	1
um	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
grew	1
up	0
in	0
the	1
sixties	1
and	1
back	0
then	1
it	0
was	0
popular	1
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	1

but	0
people	1
have	0
really	1
wisened	1
you	1
know	0
become	1
wise	1
about	0
drugs	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
they	0
really	1
have	0
a	0
good	1
campaign	1
for	0
the	0
young	1
people	1
you	1
know	0

uh-huh	0

they	0
know	1
it's	0
not	0
smart	1
so	1
so	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
a	0
generational	1
thing	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
peer	1
group	1
is	0
the	1
other	0
way	1
now	1
instead	1
of	0

that's	0
right	1
and	0
that's	1
good	1

uh-huh	0
that's	1

that's	0
the	0
best	1
way	1
to	0
stop	1
it	0

yeah	1
that	1
it	0
really	1
is	1

a	0
german	1
shepherd	1

dysplasia	1

um-hum	0

and	0
he	1
had	1
it	1
for	0
about	0
three	1

had	0
to	0
lift	1
him	0
and	0
carry	1
him	0

place	1
he	0
went	1

so	1
when	0

little	1
one	0

our	1
shepherd	1
was	0
almost	0
thirteen	1

and	0
then	1
we've	0
had	0
three	1

to	0
we	0
had	0
to	0
flea	1
bath	0
them	0
and	0
that	0
was	1
uh	0
that	0
was	1
an	0
experience	1
that	0
they	0

and	0
my	0
husband	1
then	0
fiance	1
was	0
to	0
keep	1
my	0
cat	1
and	0
he	0
let	1
her	0
out	1
and	1
my	0
house	1
was	1
loaded	1
with	0
fleas	1
i	1
mean	0
you	0
walked	1
in	1
and	1
your	0
legs	1
were	0
just	0
black	1

really	1

and	0
we	1
had	0
such	1
a	0
time	1
and	0
never	1
got	0
the	0
cat	1
back	0

really	1

yeah	1
i	0
found	1
it	0
you	1
know	1
in	1
the	0
street	1

ah	0

was	1
a	1
social	1
worker	0
at	1
the	0
time	1
and	0
found	1
that	0
it	0

are	1
you	1
there	1

um-hum	1

okay	1
now	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
favorite	1
team	1

uh	1
baseball	1

yes	1

well	1
i've	1
been	1
kind	1
of	1
been	1
intrigued	1
with	1
the	1
rangers	1
uh	1
more	1
so	1
with	1
uh	0
uh	0
their	1
management	1
than	0
anything	1
else	1
i'd	0
i	0
don't	1
follow	1
baseball	1
that	0
that	0
closely	1
but	1
uh	1
si[nce]	1
you	1
know	1
since	1
i	0
live	1
here	0
so	1
close	1
to	1
arlington	1
uh	1
that's	1
the	0
team	1
that	1
i've	1
been	1
kind	0
of	1
following	1

okay	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
a	1
little	1
bit	0
late	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
for	1
them	1
to	0
assign	1
us	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
they're	1
headed	1
so	1
we'll	1
have	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
future	1
with	0
the	0
rangers	1

um-hum	0

right	1

what	1
are	1
your	1
thinkings	1
on	1
what	1
they	0
can	1
do	1
what	1
they'll	0
be	1
able	1
to	0
do	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
uh	1
you	1
know	1
with	1
uh	0
so	0
much	0
controversy	1
over	0
ruben	1
sierra	1
not	0
signing	1
and	0
asking	1
us	1
for	1
so	0
much	0
money	1
it's	1
um	1
you	0
know	0
i	1
think	1
i'm	1
not	1
real	0
sure	1
about	0
th[at]	0
do	0
you	0
know	1
anything	0
about	1
ruben	0
sierra's	1
uh	0

well	0
i	0
heard	1
tonight	1
on	0
the	0
news	1
that	1
he	1
is	0
willing	1
to	1
come	0
down	1
on	1
his	1

yeah	1
that	0
he	0
was	0
willing	1
to	0
come	0
down	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	0
uh	0
if	1
the	0
rangers	1
will	0
go	0
up	1
a	1
little	1
bit	0
yeah	1

yes	1

and	1
the	0
rangers	1
go	1
up	1
a	1
[laughter-little]	1
bit	1
um-hum	0

but	0
a	1
little	1
bit	0
from	0
three	1
you	0
know	1
from	1
thirty	1
million	1
dollars	1
or	0
thirty	0
five	1
mill[ion]	1
that's	1
a	1
lot	0
of	1
money	1

i	1
think	1
the	1
entire	1
baseball	1
yeah	1
they're	1
the	0
ones	1
that	0
probably	1
are	1
paying	1
the	1
highest	1

yeah	1
they	1
are	0

and	1
i	1
think	1
this	0
is	0
absolutely	1
ridiculous	1

um-hum	0

no	1

and	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
i	1
really	0
think	0
that	0
uh	0
that	0
they	0
ought	1
to	0
i'm	1
not	1
real	0
sure	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
pay	1
him	1
that	0
much	1
money	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
should	1
uh	1
uh	0
pay	1
him	0
what	0
his	0
salary's	1
going	0
to	0
be	1
uh	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
because	1
he's	1
got	0
one	1
more	0
year	1
before	0
he	0
turns	1
into	1
a	0
a	1
free	0
agent	1

that's	1
right	1

and	1
then	1
uh	1
who	1
knows	1
if	1
he	1
produces	1
next	1
year	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
end	1
up	1
paying	0
him	0
anyway	1
but	1
if	0
he	1
doesn't	1
then	1
his	0
market	1
value	1
will	1
go	0
down	1
and	1
they	0
can	1
pick	0
him	0
up	1
for	0
for	0
a	1
lot	0
less	1
than	1
than	0
they	1
would	1
uh	0
if	0
they	0
paid	1
him	0
the	0
si[x]	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
six	0
million	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
this	1
year	0

what	0
i	1
saw	1
on	1
the	0
news	1
today	1
that	0
bue[chele]	0
buechele	1
was	0
back	1
just	1
to	1
visit	1

uh-huh	1

i'm	1
awful	1
sorry	1
he's	1
not	1
still	1

oh	0
yeah	1
but	0
you	1
know	0
what	1
he	1
that	1
was	0
a	0
great	1
deal	1
for	1
him	1

oh	1
i'm	0
sure	1
it	1
was	1

yeah	1
it	1
was	0
a	0
great	1
deal	1
for	0
him	1
and	1
and	1
uh	1
he	1
just	1
signed	0
on	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
it	1
was	0
like	1
a	1
five	1
year	0
deal	1
with	0
uh	0
pittsburgh	1
so	0

pittsburgh	1

yeah	1

so	0
you	1
know	0
he's	1
real	0
happy	0
there	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	0
rangers	1
are	0
concerned	0
i	1
think	0
i	1
think	1
they	1
need	1
some	0
definitely	1
need	0
some	0
pitching	1

yes	1
sir	0

uh	0
and	0
so	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
i	0

well	0
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
howse	1
who	1
is	0
the	0
coach	1
for	0
the	0
pitchers	1

the	0
pitching	1
coach	1

yes	1

well	0
you	1
know	1
i	1
was	0
just	1
looking	1
at	0
the	0
news	1
tonight	1
and	1
they	1
showed	1
a	1
a	1
a	1
black	1
guy	1
that	1
was	0
go[ing]	0
was	1
helping	1
out	1
uh	0
his	0
assistant	1
and	0

his	1
assistant	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	1
think	0
that's	0
a	0
a	0
great	0
addition	1
i	1
mean	0
he	1
seemed	0
to	0
know	0
what	0
he	0
was	1
doing	1
and	1
and	1
uh	0

i	1
really	1
wish	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
fit	1
to	0
get	0
rid	1
of	0
howse	0

oh	0
you	0
don't	1
like	0
howse	1
huh	0

no	1
no	1
i	0
really	1
don't	0

and	0
i'm	1
not	1
[laughter-going]	0
to	0
stand	1
up	0
you	0
know	1
on	0
my	0
soapbox	1
and	0
say	1
that	0

but	0
i'm	0
not	1
fond	1
of	1
howse	1
and	0

and	0
i'm	1
not	0
fond	1
of	0
grieves	1

oh	0
tom	1
grieve	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i'm	1
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
that	0
um	1
that	0
they're	0
ready	1
to	1
get	0
rid	1
of	1
of	1
uh	0
tom	0
grieve	1
yet	0
but	1
howse	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
different	1
uh	1
situation	1
and	0
i	1
think	0
you're	1
probably	1
right	1
that	1
they	1
that	1
they	0
need	1
some	0
you	1
know	1
some	0
changes	1
in	0
uh	1
pitching	1
coach	1
maybe	1
and	0
um	1

well	0
i'm	1
just	0
gullible	1
enough	1
that	0
i	1
think	1
bobby	0
valentine	1
is	0
um	0
uh	0
doing	0
all	0
right	1
and	0
i'm	1
sure	1

you	0
do	1
huh	0

well	1

that's	0
contrary	1
to	0
uh	0
popular	1
belief	1
you	0
know	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1
i	0
[laughter-know]	1
so	1
but	0
i	1
would	0
like	1
so	1
much	1
for	0
these	1
rangers	1
to	0
get	0
their	0
act	1
together	1
and	0
give	1
um	0
oh	0
uh	0
nolan	1
ryan	1
the	0
support	1
he	0
needs	1

oh	0
i	1
know	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
too	0
bad	1
that	0
uh	1
it	0
has	1
to	1
be	0
a	0
forty	1
two	1
year	1
old	0
guy	1
to	1
to	0
lead	1
the	0
uh	0
the	0
rangers	1
you	0
know	1

i	1
understand	1

they	1
need	1
to	1
have	1
some	0
some	0
young	1
guys	1
that	1
can	0
take	0
the	1
lead	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
yeah	0

well	1
i	1
just	0
oh	0
i	1
have	0
so	0
many	1
mixed	0
emotions	1
about	1
all	0
this	1
but	0

but	0
i	1
think	1
with	0
their	1
new	1
stadium	1
they	1
should	0
go	1
and	0
let's	1
us	1

okay	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it	1

well	1
uh	1
the	1
roles	1
have	1
definitely	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
generation	1
or	1
so	1

oh	1
yeah	1

um	1
i	1
i	0
think	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
women	1
working	1

uh-huh	1
yeah	1
i	1
do	1
too	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
going	0
to	1
in	1
like	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
i	0
think	1
all	1
women	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
work	1

yeah	1

i	1
mean	1
they	1
may	1
let	1
you	1
off	1
for	0
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
to	0
have	1
your	1
baby	1
but	0
that	0
will	1
be	0
it	1

yeah	1

or	1
either	0
they'll	1
have	1
a	1
computer	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
where	1
you	0
can	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
just	0
continue	1
right	1
on	1
with	0
your	1
work	1

ye[ah]	0
yeah	1

i	1
mean	1
i[t]	1
it	1
really	1
is	1
coming	1
to	0
that	1
because	0
most	1
women	1
now	1
days	0
cannot	1
afford	1
the	1
time	1
that	0
they	1
could	0
take	1
off	1
unless	1
the	1
company	1
pays	1
them	1

right	1
right	1

they	1
can't	1
even	0
afford	1
to	0
take	1
off	1
you	1
know	1
to	0
have	0
children	1
it	1
seems	1
like	0

and	1
it	1
and	0
it	1
seems	1
if	1
you're	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
kids	1
uh	1
that	0
you	0
are	1
you	1
know	1
society	1
has	1
decided	1
for	1
you	1
how	1
many	1
you	1
can	1
really	1
have	1
and	1
make	1
it	1

yeah	1

and	1
uh	1
because	1
if	1
you	0
have	1
you	1
know	0
two	1
well	1
if	0
you	1
go	1
to	0
work	1
you're	1
just	1
working	1
to	1
pay	1
for	0
day	1
care	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
you	1
know	1
um	0

right	0

now	0
i	1
was	0
real	0
lucky	1
because	0
my	0
husband	1
had	0
a	0
good	0
enough	0
job	1
where	0
when	0
my	1
kids	1
were	0
you	0
know	0
when	1
i	0
had	1
them	1
and	0
when	0
they	0
were	1
small	1
until	0
they	1
got	0
in	0
junior	1
high	1
school	0
my	0
youngest	1
one	1
got	0
in	0
junior	1
high	1
i	0
didn't	1
have	0
to	0
work	1

uh-huh	1

oh	1
that	0
is	1
good	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
didn't	1
work	0
i	0
i	0
needed	1
to	0
but	0
i	0
didn't	1

yeah	0
steve's	1
steve	1
has	0
a	1
sister	1
who	1
has	0
four	1
she	0
just	1
had	1
her	0
fourth	1
one	1
in	1
uh	0
march	1
and	1
she	1
doesn't	1
have	0
to	1
work	1
either	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
they	0
do	1
it	0
i	1
don['t]	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
people	1
do	1
it	0
with	0
one	1
you	1
know	1
um	1
obviously	0

let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	0
you	0
go	1
without	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
things	1
that	0
you	0
wou[ld]	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
obviously	1
we	1
don't	1
have	1
any	1
and	1
and	0
i	1
don't	0
i	1
think	1
that's	0
part	1
of	1
the	0
role	0
reversal	1
is	1
it's	0
okay	1
to	0
get	0
married	1
and	1
not	1
have	0
kids	1

oh	1
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
think	1
for	0
society	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
said	0
well	1
you	0
know	1
you're	1
married	1
now	1
you	1
need	0
to	0
se[t]	0
have	0
have	1
your	0
family	1
and	1
i	0
don't	1
think	1
it's	0
been	0
until	1
recently	1
that	0
that	0
they	1
had	1
decided	1
that	0
two	1
people	1
was	1
a	1
family	0

right	1
right	0

you	0
know	0
and	0

well	1
it's	1
getting	1
where	1
you	1
can't	1
hardly	0
afford	1
if	0
you're	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
your	0
kids	1
any	0
kind	1
of	1
education	1
and	1
stuff	0
you	1
can't	1
hardly	0
afford	1
to	1
have	1
over	1
two	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
mean	0
it's	0
hard	1
with	1
two	1
now	1
we	1
uh	1
my	1
youngest	1
one	0
i	1
have	0
two	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
son	1
and	0
a	0
daughter	1
and	1
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
is	0
going	1
to	0
be	1
graduating	1
from	0
college	1
soon	1

oh	1

but	0
if	0
i	1
had	1
a	0
third	1
one	1
i	1
just	0
don't	0
know	1
where	1
it	0
would	0
come	1
from	0

[laughter-yeah]	0

yeah	0

because	1
i	1
work	0
now	1
i	0
work	1
full	0
time	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
it	0
when	0
you	1
put	0
them	0
through	0
college	1
it	0
just	0
takes	1
just	0
about	0
everything	1
you	0
got	1

yeah	1

they	0
get	0
loans	1
and	0
grants	1
and	0
scholarships	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
that	0
helps	0
out	1
but	0
still	1
it	0
cost	1
a	0
lot	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
mean	0
just	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
cost	1
of	1
living	1
and	1
loans	1
don't	0
pay	1
for	0
groceries	1
and	1
stuff	1

right	1
and	0
cars	1
and	1
all	1
their	0
books	1
and	1
the	0
books	1
are	0
outrageous	1
i	0
mean	1
absolutely	1
outrageous	1
and	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0

and	1
they're	0
getting	0
worse	1
uh	1
my	0
daughter	1
brought	1
home	1
a	0
book	1
the	1
other	0
day	1
that	0
she	1
was	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
for	0
her	0
one	1
of	0
her	0
next	0
classes	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
like	1
ninety	1
six	0
dollars	1
and	0

jeez	0

and	0
this	1
book	1
is	0
a	0
little	1
bitty	0
skinny	1
book	1

yeah	0

i	1
said	0
my	0
goodness	1
what	0
is	1
it	0
lined	1
in	0
gold	1
you	1
know	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
it	0
is	1
it's	0
getting	0
worse	1
and	0
if	0
i'd	1
of	0
probably	0
had	1
three	1
or	0
four	0
children	1
i	0
don't	0
see	1
how	0
we	0
could	0
have	0
made	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
without	1
me	0
working	0

but	0
that's	1
that's	1
probably	1
because	0
you	1
know	0
if	1
you	1
had	1
three	1
you	1
you	1
know	0
would	1
say	0
if	1
i'd	1
of	0
had	0
four	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
always	1
not	1
not	1
being	0
able	0
to	0
picture	1
one	1
more	1
but	0
in	0
essence	1
you	0
probably	1
would	0
have	0
worked	1
out	0
fine	1

right	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	0
to	0
work	1

yeah	1

if	0
i'd	1
of	0
had	0
that	1
many	0
i'd	0
of	0
had	1
to	0
work	1
in	0
order	1
for	0
my	0
kids	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
even	1
though	0
he	0
brings	1
in	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
living	1
and	0
everything	0
in	0
order	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
keep	0
up	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	1
to	0
work	0

yeah	0

but	1
i	1
think	1
it's	0
getting	1
more	1
and	0
more	1
like	0
when	0
you	1
have	0
one	1
child	1
now	0
that's	0
it	1
you	0
know	1
then	1

then	1
you	0
go	1
to	0
work	1
and	1
you	0
work	1

yeah	1

because	1
if	0
you	1
have	1
two	1
or	1
three	0
kids	1
by	1
the	0
way	1
the	0
inflation's	1
going	0
i	1
think	0
a	0
woman's	1
always	1
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
and	0
it's	0
just	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
an	0
accepted	1
thing	1
there	0
isn't	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
any	0
of	0
this	0
you	0
know	0
very	1
few	0
people	1
will	0
ever	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
that's	1
all	1
right	1
with	0
me	1
because	1
i	1
don't	0
want	1
to	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
i	1
think	0
i'm	1
just	0
part	1
of	0
tha[t]	1
the	0
new	1
stuff	1
that	0
is	1
just	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
would	1
just	1
go	1
nuts	1
sitting	1
at	1
home	1
all	1
day	0
long	1

well	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
how	0
i	1
did	1
because	0
now	1
i	0
work	1
all	0
the	0
time	1

yeah	1

and	1
um	0
well	0
i	0
work	1
all	0
week	1
and	1
um	0
i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
how	1
i	0
stayed	0
home	1

yeah	0

you	1
know	0
i	0
think	1
to	0
myself	1
what	1
did	0
i	0
do	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
just	1
it	0
revolutionized	1
an	0
where	0
a	0
woman	1
thinks	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
you	0
know	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
my	1
daughter	1
there's	1
no	0
way	1
that	0
she	1
can	0
imagine	1
herself	0
married	1
at	0
the	0
age	1
that	0
she's	0
at	0
now	1
to	0
her	1
everything	1
is	0
you've	0
got	0
to	0
go	1
through	0
college	1
you've	0
got	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
then	1
when	0
everything's	1
set	0
up	0
then	1
you	0
look	0
for	0
somebody	1
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
spend	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
your	0
life	1
with	0
but	0
i	1
mean	0
it	0
is	0
so	1
far	0
down	0
the	0
road	1
where	0

right	1

where	0
now	1
when	0
i	1
graduated	0
high	1
school	0
the	0
thing	1

that's	1
you	1
did	1
that's	1
what	0
you	0
did	1
uh	1

uh-huh	1
and	0
then	1
you	0
got	0
married	1
and	0
then	0
you	1
had	0
a	0
family	1

i	1
mean	0
that's	0
just	0
the	0
way	1
it	0
was	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1

and	1
uh	0
that's	1
like	0
when	0
my	0
mo[m]	0
i	0
know	1
when	0
my	0
mother's	1
age	0
it	1
was	0
always	1
the	0
kids	1
and	0
the	0
family	1
and	0
everything	1
had	0
to	0
come	0
first	1
and	0
the	0
woman	1
stayed	0
home	1
and	0
took	0
care	1
of	0
them	0
an	0

i	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
like	1
the	0
way	0
it	0
is	1

yeah	0

it's	0
uh	0
being	1
see	0
we're	1
from	0
houston	1
and	0
so	0
it's	0
not	1
so	0
hard	1
for	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
you've	1
been	0
married	1
three	1
or	0
so	0
years	1
and	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
kids	1
well	0
it's	0
okay	1
no[t]	0
nobody	0
does	1
but	0
you	0
come	0
to	0
a	0
place	1
like	0
belton	1
and	1
th[ere]	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
kids	1
here	1
get	1
married	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0

uh-huh	1

it's	0
real	1
small	0
town	0
and	1
it's	0
and	0
a	1
lot	1
of	1
people	1
in	0
our	0
su[nday]	1
we're	1
the	1
only	0
couple	1
in	0
our	0

except	1
for	0
one	1
other	0
couple	1
who	1
are	1
in	0
their	0
forties	1
and	1
they	1
can't	1
have	0
children	1
who	0
don't	1
have	1
children	1
and	0
they	0
can't	1
imagine	1
why	1
we	0
would	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
children	1
and	0
i'm	0
going	1
well	1
you	0
know	1
there's	0
more	1
to	1
life	1
you	0
know	1
there's	1
life	1
in	0
there	1
that's	0

you	1
know	0
not	0
everybody	1
has	1
to	0
have	0
kids	1
and	0
i'd	1
rather	0
spend	0
the	0
time	1
with	0
my	0
husband	1
than	0
you	0
know	1
spending	0
time	1
here	1
it's	0
your	1
turn	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
that	1
now	1
even	1
whenever	0
i	1
was	0
coming	0
up	1
and	0
everything	0
and	0
we	1
got	0
married	0
right	1
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0
well	0
a	0
year	1
after	0
i	1
got	0
out	0
of	1
high	1
school	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
i	1
didn't	0
have	0
kids	1
for	0
four	1
and	1
a	0
half	0
years	1
but	0
that	1
was	0
because	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
work	1
and	1
i	0
wasn't	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
that's	1
what	0
it	1
is	0
i'm	1
not	1
either	1

and	0
everybody	1
thought	1
oh	1
my	0
gosh	1
what	1
is	0
the	0
matter	1
with	0
her	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

they're	0
probably	1
going	0
oh	1
i	0
bet	1
she	0
can't	1
get	0
pregnant	1

right	1
i	1
mean	0
they	1
thought	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
terrible	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
i'd	0
tell	1
them	0
you	0
know	0
well	0
i'm	1
just	0
not	0
ready	1
for	0
children	1
yet	0
oh	1
but	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
you	1
better	1
you	0
better	1
just	0
get	0
ready	1
now	1

yeah	0

well	0
you	1
don't	0
just	1
get	0
ready	1
but	0
i	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
odd	1
because	0
as	0
a	0
general	0
rule	1
the	0
people	1
that	0
married	1
during	0
my	1
time	1
they	1
had	0
kids	1
within	0
a	0
year	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	1
just	0
was	1
not	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	1
i	1
wanted	0
to	1
get	1
out	1
and	1
work	1
a	0
little	1
bit	1
and	1
i	1
wanted	0
to	0
travel	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
which	0
we	0
did	1
and	1
uh	0
kids	1
didn't	0
fit	0
in	1
right	0
then	1
but	0
it's	0
getting	1
more	0
and	0
more	1
like	0
that	1
where	0
there's	0
more	1
and	0
more	0
couples	1
and	1
really	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
the	0
kids	0
then	1
it's	0
not	1
the	0
time	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
i	1
don't	0
care	0
what	0
anybody	1
tells	0
you	0

right	1

and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
the	0
attitude's	1
getting	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
because	1
that's	1
like	0
my	0
daughter	1
now	0
she	1
says	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
maybe	1
when	0
she's	0
thirty	1
she	0
might	1
want	0
a	0
child	0
then	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
even	1
though	0
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
have	0
grandchildren	1
i	1
can	0
see	0
her	0
point	1

yeah	1
steve's	1
mom	1
finally	0
uh	0
finally	1
s[aid]	0
you	0
know	1
said	1
that	0
that	0
god	1
will	0
take	1
care	1
of	0
us	0
when	1

she	0
finally	1
told	1
me	0
it's	0
okay	1
if	0
you	0
don't	1
but	0
it	1
took	0
every	1
nerve	0
in	0
her	0
body	1
to	0
say	1
that	0
because	0
she's	1
from	0
a	0
very	1
very	0
old	0
fashioned	1
family	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
she	1
stayed	0
home	0
and	0
raised	1
her	0
kids	0
and	0
and	1
she	0
expected	1
all	0
of	0
her	0
kids	1
to	1
do	1
that	0
too	1
and	0
their	1
wives	1
and	0
to	0

the	0
housewife	1
and	0

and	0
and	1

know	0
be	1
there	0
at	0
every	0
beck	1
and	0

and	0
i	1

raised	0
totally	0
opposite	1
[laughter-how]	1
we	0
got	0
together	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
but	0
because	0
my	1
mother	0
had	0
six	0
girls	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
she	1
worked	0
too	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	0
and	0
i	0
saw	1
how	1
life	1
was	0
when	0
she	0
stayed	0
home	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
rough	1
it	1
was	0
hard	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
and	1
it	0
really	0
is	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
you	0
know	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	1
much	0
more	1
now	0
all	1
my	0
income	1
goes	1
for	0
things	1
like	0
luxuries	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
really	1
does	1
except	1
for	0
what	0
we	1
give	0
to	0
my	0
daughter	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
put	0
her	0
through	0
college	1
and	0
stuff	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
the	0
rest	1
of	0
it	0
we	1
just	0
buy	1
things	1
like	0
boats	1
or	1
we	0
go	0
on	0
trips	1
or	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
the	0
more	1
or	0
less	1
like	0
entertainment	1
stuff	0

right	1

but	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you've	1
earned	1
that	0
though	0

yeah	1
i	1
feel	0
like	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
because	1
well	1
we're	1
to	0
the	0
age	1
now	1
i'm	1
not	0
old	1
but	0
i'm	0
older	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
got	0
to	0
stay	0
home	1
with	0
my	0
kids	1
which	0
i	0
really	1
wanted	1
to	0
do	1
but	0
now	1
i	0
could	0
not	1
go	0
back	1
and	0
do	1
it	0

yeah	0

i	0
really	1
couldn't	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i	0
could	0
stay	1
home	1
all	1
the	0
time	0
and	0
do	0
nothing	1
and	0
i	1
mean	0
i	0
did	1
stuff	0
but	0
to	0
me	1
it	0
[laughter-feels]	1
[laughter-like]	0
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-must]	0
have	0
done	1
nothing	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
just	0
the	0
new	1
way	0
that	0
people	1
are	0
thinking	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
so	1

but	1
uh	0

i	0
think	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
neat	1
if	1
if	0
they	1
could	0
incorporate	1
into	0
small	1
and	0
large	1
businesses	0
both	1
a	0
built	1
in	0
day	1
cares	1
where	0
the	0
children	1
were	0
there	1
in	1
the	0
facility	1
but	0
not	1
necessarily	1
right	1
there	0
with	1
you	0

well	0
you	1
know	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	0
them	0
are	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it	0
is	1
up	0
there	0
where	0
you	1
are	0
but	0
where	0
i	1
am	0
the	0
just	1
like	0
all	1
the	0
hospitals	1
they're	1
getting	0
day	1
care	0

uh-huh	1

are	1
they	1

but	1
the	0
reason	1
they	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
this	0
was	0
because	0
so	1
many	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
so	1
many	0
women	1
could	0
not	1
afford	1
like	0
you	1
said	0
if	0
you	1
had	0
four	1
kids	1
or	0
even	1
if	0
you	1
had	0
two	1
kids	0
you	1
would	0
be	0
paying	1
all	1
your	0
salary	1
to	0
pay	1
for	0
those	0
two	0
kids	1
to	0
go	1

right	1

so	1
uh	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	0
our	0
hospitals	1
especially	1
over	0
here	1
are	0
getting	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
bigger	0
companies	1
but	0
it's	0
mainly	1
the	0
hospitals	1

yeah	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
if	0
the	0
ti	1
in	0
dallas	1
does	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	1
nobody	0
around	0
here	1
does	0
it	0
we're	1
it's	0
too	1
small	1
around	0
here	1

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

okay	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
puppy	1
you	1
got	1

well	1

mostly	1
german	1

this	1
dog	1
appear	1
on	1
its	1
front	1
doorstep	1
somebody	1

uh	1

somebody	1
somebody	1
abandoned	1
her	1

six	1
and	1
eight	1
six	1
to	1
eight	1
weeks	1
old	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	1
uh	1
i	1
can't	0
understand	1
why	1
anyone	1
would	1
abandon	1
this	1

oh	1

she's	1
al[most]	1

to	0
them	0

oh	1

a	1
uh	1
last	1
year	1
i	1

ano[ther]	1
i	0

another	1
german	1
shepherd	1
now	1
this	1
one	0

purebred	1
and	1
uh	0

about	1
seven	1
months	1
old	1
got	0
a	0
gastrointestinal	1
virus	1
and	1
was	1

in	1
time	1

um-hum	1

actually	1
was	0
able	1
to	1
get	0
him	1
over	1
that	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
gaining	1
weight	1
again	1
was	1
just	1
getting	1
healthy	1
and	1
uh	0
he	1
put	1
on	0
about	1
fifteen	1
to	0
twenty	1

after	1
the	1

to	0
be	0
degenerating	1
here	0
so	1

hello	1

hello	1

hi	1

this	1
is	1
lois	1

hi	1
this	1
is	1
lisa	1

and	1
um	1
i	1
called	1
you	1
know	1
from	1
that	1
the	1
the	1
ti	1
database	1
calling	1
instructions	1

um-hum	1
yeah	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
call	1
yesterday	1
too	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
different	1
subject	1
though	1

yeah	0
this	1
is	1
about	1
changes	1
in	1
women	1
in	1
the	1

um-hum	1

uh	1
there's	1
really	1
a	1
lot	1
isn't	1
[laughter-there]	1
[laughter-i]	1

yeah	1

[laughter-i]	1
[laughter-mean]	1
there	1
really	1
is	1

[i]t's	1
kind	1
of	1
an	0
easy	1
thing	1
to	0
talk	1
about	1

oh	1
i	1
guess	1
the	1
work	1
force	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
main	1
wouldn't	1
it	0

yeah	1
um	1
i	1
think	1
you	0
have	1
to	1
push	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
can	1
start	1
recording	1
it	0

okay	1
all	1
right	1

okay	1

are	1
you	1
ready	1
now	1

yes	1

okay	1
like	0
i	1
said	1
i	1
guess	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
the	0
work	1
force	1
you	0
know	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
changes	1
in	0
the	0
generations	1

yes	1
i	1
know	1
because_1	1
i	1
know	1
when	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
a	1
you	1
know	1
going	1
into	0
the	0
work	1
force	1
there	0
wasn't	1
very	0
many	1
opportunities	1
for	0
her	1
i	0
guess	1
she's	1
in	1
her	0
late	0
forties	1
you	1
were	1
expected	1
to	1
stay	1
home	1
and	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
i've	1
never	1
faced	1
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	1
no	1
i	1
think	1
n[ow]	1
now	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
work	1
when	1
they're	1
six	1
weeks	1
old	1
you	1
know	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
you	0
stay	1
there	1
and	1
i	0
feel	1
like	1
the	1
next	1
generation	1
you'll	1
probably	0
just	0
work	1
right	0
along	1
with	1
your	0
husband	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
um-hum	0
i	0
think	1
it's	1
definitely	1
gotten	0
better	1

oh	1
i	1
do	0
too	1
much	1
and	1
it's	1
just	1
gonna	1
get	1
better	1

um-hum	0

it	1
really	1
is	1

because_1	0
women	1
are	0
in	0
every	1
field	0
now	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
can't	1
think	1
of	0
a	0
field	1
that	0
they're	0
not	1
involved	0
in	1

oh	1
i	1
can't	1
either	1
not	1
a	1
one	1

i	1
know	0
at	0
least	1
in	1
the	1
medical	1
field	1
it	1
seems	1
like	1
they've	1
come	1
out	0
with	1
a	1
lot	1
further	1
advances	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
female	1
medications	1
and	0
things	1
since	0
women	1
have	0
gotten	0
into	1
the	0
doctor	1
field	0

um-hum	1

i	0
don't	0
think	1
that	0
men	1
really	0
took	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
work	1
on	0
that	0
[laughter-sort]	0
[laughter-of]	1
[laughter-thing]	1

yeah	0
even	1
in	0
washington	1
you	0
know	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
lot	0
more	1
women	1
involved	1

yeah	1

hopefully	1
the	1
next	1
generation	1
it	1
won't	1
even	0
be	0
an	0
issue	1
i	1
mean	0
people	1
will	1
just	1
look	1
at	1
you	0
as	0
a	1
person	1
and	0
not	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
woman	1
i	1

yes	1
yes	1

i	1
think	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
goal	1

oh	0
i	1
do	0
too	1
just	1
your	1
qualifications	1
and	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
it	1

uh-huh	0
exactly	1
not	0
what	0
color	1
you	0
are	1
how	0
old	1
you	0
are	1
what	1
if	0
your	0
male	1
or	0
female	1
that	1
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1
i	0
guess	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
an	0
ideal	1
world	0
though	0
huh	1

yeah	1
i	1
kind	1
of	1
think	1
maybe	0
in	1
time	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
you'll	0
go	1
by	1
social	1
security	1
numbers	1
you	0
know	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
that	0
way	1
they	0
can't	1
say	1
well	1
they	1
picked	1
the	1
male	1
over	1
a	1
female	1
or	1
female	1
over	0
a	0
male	1
you	0
know	1
you	1

exactly	1
or	0
the	0
way	1
you	0
look	1
or	0
the	0
way	1
you	0
you	1
know	0
your	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

your	0
age	1
or	0
anything	1
i	0
think	1
that'd	0
be	0
a	1
wonderful	1
way	1
to	0
do	1
it	1

i	1
do	1
too	1
just	1
go	1
by	0
your	0
social	1
security	1
number	1
and	1
then	0
look	1
at	1
your	0
qualifications	1
that	1
you	0
know	1
that	0
you	0
have	1

um-hum	1
and	1
then	1

and	0
if	1
you	0
get	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
then	1

um-hum	0
also	1
with	0
uh	0
women	1
in	0
the	0
work	1
force	1
they've	0
gotten	1
a	0
lot	0
more	0
options	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
you	0
know	1
what's	1
it	0
called	1
job	1
sharing	1

um-hum	0

like	0
if	0
you	1
and	0
another	0
lady	0
were	0
to	0
share	1
the	1
same	0
full	1
time	0
job	1
or	1

oh	1
yeah	1

as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	0
fact	1
that's	0
what	1
i'm	0
doing	1

is	1
it	0

um-hum	0
it	1
sure	0
is	1

that	1
would	0
be	1
great	1

it	0
sure	1
is	1

or	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	1
i	0
know	0
now	1
and	1
my	1
uh	1
one	0
of	1
my	0
supervisors	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
loa	1
to	0
have	1
her	1
baby	1

hooked	1
up	1
a	0
a	0
a	0
terminal	1
at	0
her	0
house	1
and	1
sh[e]	0
you	0

could	0
send	1
her	0
messages	1
and	0
and	0
she	1
kept	1
in	0
touch	1
like	0
that	1
and	0
basically	1
just	0
worked	1
out	0
of	0
her	0

oh	0

i	1
would	0
just	1
take	1

a	0
wonderful	1
system	1
that	1
we're	0
working	1
under	1

yeah	1
especially_1	1
with	1
children	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
going	1
on	1
that	1
would	0
be	0
great	1

yeah	1

it	0
really	1
is	1
and	0
that	1
way	0
we're	0
not	1
really	0

your	0
career	1
and	1
your	0

life	1
and	0
that'd	1
be	0
a	1
nice	1
way	0
to	1
especially_1	1
if	1
you	0
have	1
young	1
children	1

oh	1

to	0
miss	1
any	0
of	0
those	1
pta's	1
and	0
you	1
know	1
all	1
of	0
that	1
so	0

my	1
son's	0
just	0
in	0
day	1
care	1
but	0
even	0
that	1
they	0
have	1
extracurricular	1
activities	1
and	0
the	0
older	1
they	0
get	0
the	0
more	1
that	1
you're	1
involved	1
in	0
that	1

um-hum	0
yeah	1
yes	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
great	1
i	0
really	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
look	0
for	0
more	1
of	0
that	1
in	0
the	0
next	1
generation	1

i	1
do	0
too	1
especially	1
as	0
women	1
get	0
up	1
in	0
management	1
and	1
and	1
can	0
be	1
in	0
on	0
those	0
decision	1
making	1
you	0
know	1
when	0
that	1
subject	1
comes	0
up	1
they	1
can	0
say	0
yes	1
that	0
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1

yes	1
oh	0
i	1
do	0
too	1

plus	1
i	0
bet	1
it	0
cuts	1
cuts	0
down	1
on	0
your	0
absenteeism	1
because_1	0
you've	0
got	1
two	0
days	0
off	1
that	1
you	0
can	1
do	1
everything	1
so	0
you	0
don't	0
have	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
unless	0
you're	0
just	0
really	1
sick	1
or	0
the	0
child's	1
sick	1

most	0
time	0
now	1
you	0
know	1
it's	1
just	0
a	0
weekend	1
or	1
just	1
forget	1
it	1

um-hum	0
oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
have	0
to	0
plan	1
way	0
in	0
advance	1
because	0
or	1
what	0
i've	0
done	0
is	0
found	1
like	0
doctors'	1
and	0
dentists'	1
office	0
with	0
extended	0
hours	1

uh-huh	0

that's	1
been	0
real	0
helpful	0
too	1
like	0
my	0
doctor	1
stays	0
open	0
till	0
nine	1
in	0
the	0
evening	1
so	0
that's	1
real	0
helpful	1
so	0
you	0
don't	1
you	0
know	1
have	0
to	0
do	0
it	1
during	0
office	1
hours	1
run	0
out	0
on	0
your	0
lunch	1
hour	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
many	0
times	1
i've	0
done	1
that	0
to	0
do	0
[laughter-something]	1
post	0
office	1
or	0
the	0
bank	1
or	0
any	1
uh	0
kind	0
of	0
errand	1

to	0
do	1
[laughter-yeah]	0

so	1

um-hum	0
yeah	1
i	1
think	1
we've	1
really	1
come	0
a	0
long	0
ways	1
in	1
that	1
because	1

uh-huh	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
take	0
it	0
for	0
granted	1
kind	1
of	0
because_1	0
i	0
just	1
it's	0
always	0
been	1
that	0
way	1

um-hum	0

but	0
i	0
know	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
can	0
remem[ber]	1
remember	1
back	0
growing	0
up	1
my	1
mother	1
i	0
mean	1
it	0
was	1
she	1
always	1
worked	1
but	0
it	1
wasn't	0
that	0
easy	1
for	0
her	1
to	0
just	0
take	0
off	1

oh	0
no	1
i	0
can	0
remember	1
my	0
mother	0
getting	1
in	0
trouble	1
if	0
you	0
know	1
one	0
of	0
us	0
was	0
sick	1
and	0
i	0
know	1
she	0
probably	0
didn't	0
make	1
hardly	0
anything	1
you	0
know	1
compared	0
to	0
the	0
work	1
that	0
she	0
did	1

oh	0
yes	1
um-hum	0
where	1
oh	1
yeah	1

i	0
think	0
there's	0
still	1
some	0
discrimination	1
there	1
where	0
as	0
you	0
know	0
men	0
and	0
wor[k]	1
women	1
work	0
in	0
the	0
same	0
job	1
i	0
think	0
men	1
get	0
paid	0
more	1

oh	1
i	1
do	0
too	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
that's	0
improving	1
it's	0
such	1
a	0
slow	0
process	1
it's	0
frustrating	1
but	0
mean	0
you	0
can	0
see	1
that	0
it's	0
wrong	1
and	0

yes	1
yes	0

and	0
you	0
just	1
wanna	0
make	0
it	0
right	1
but	1
at	0
least	1
the	0
wheels	0
are	0
moving	0
forward	1

they	0
really	0
are	1

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
getting	0
better	1
not	0
worse	1
well	1
i	0
should	0
probably	1
get	0
back	0
to	0
my	0
job	1

[laughter-i-]	1
[laughter-know]	1
[laughter-i]	1
know	0
the	0
feeling	1

call	1
again	1

okay	1
and	0
i	0
sure	1
will	1
and	0
bye-bye	1

okay	1
bye-bye	1

okay	1
well	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
start	1
because_1	1
it	1
said	1
i	1
was	1
suppose	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
do	1
you	1

do	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
elderly	1
relatives	1
currently	1
in	1
uh	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
now	1

yes	1
i	0
do	1

do	1
you	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
grandmother	1
she's	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
two	1

oh	1
my	1
gosh	1

she'll	0
be	0
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
three	1
in	0
august	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
we	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
she	1
lives	1
with	1
my	1
mother	1
and	0
my	1
father	1
who	1
also	1
live	1
here	1
in	1
town	1
and	1
then	1
my	1
sister	1
takes	1
care	1
of	1
her	1

uh-huh	1

she	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
two	1
she	1
still	1
has	1
all	1
of	1
her	1
faculties	1

right	1

she	1
still	1
has	1
her	1
snap	1
she	1
takes	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
business	1
this	1
is	1
the	0
first	1
year	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
gotten	0
weak	1
and	0
actually	1
has	0
to	0
have	1
a	0
little	0
walker	1
but	1
with	1
somebody	1
that	0
needs	1
around	1
the	0
clock	1
care	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
family	1
age	1

right	1

i've	1
seen	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
she's	0
been	0
there	1
ten	1
years	1
now	0
and	1
i	1
have	1
seen	0
them	0
age	1
twenty	1
in	0
the	0
time	1
and	1
and	0
with	0
the	1
expense	1
and	0
everything	1

yeah	1

i	0
th[ink]	0
i	0
still	1
think	1
it	0
is	0
worth	1
it	1
if	0
you	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
a	0
good	1
nursing	1
home	1
and	1
they	0
needed	1
some	0
quality	1
care	1
i	1
would	1
put	1
someone	1
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0

right	1

my	0
mother-in-law	1
finally	1
they	1
had	1
to	0
make	0
a	0
family	1
decision	1
there's	0
seven	1
children	1
in	0
my	1
husband's	0
family	1
and	1
fortunately	1
four	1
of	1
them_1	0
live	0
in	0
the	1
same	1
home	1
town	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
alzheimer's	1
it	0
was	1
getting	1
where	1
she	1
was	0
getting	1
th[ings]	0
dangerous	1
i	0
mean	1
letting	0
strangers	1
in	1
and	0
things	1
like	1
this	1
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0
they	1
were	0
very	0
fortunate	1
it's	1
a	1
small	1
town	1
and	1
she	0
happens	1
to	0
room	1
with	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
doctor's	1
mother's	1
and	0
then	1
she's	0
got	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
family	1
there	1
and	1
that	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
all	1
of	0
the	1
time	1
but	0

oh	0
well	1
that's	1
good	1

but	0
she	1
really	1
doesn't	1
nobody	1
thought	0
she	1
would	1
adjust	1
but	1
she's	1
adjusted	1
beautifully	1

oh	0
that	1
is	0
great	1

but	0
then	1
i	1
am	1
also	1
facing	1
my	1
father	1
who	1
is	0
very	1
sick	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
father	1
reside	0
in	1
colorado	1
she's	1
been	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
how	0
much	0
longer	1
this	1
can	1
last	1
and	1
at	0
that	1
point	1
because_1	1
he	1
requires	0
round	1
the	1
clock	0
he	0
can't	1
do	0
anything	0
without	1
her	0
he	1
doesn't	0
know	1
when	1
to	0
take	0
his	0
medicine	1
and	0
it's	0
really	1
sad	1
and	0
i	1
have	1
thought	1
if	0
something	1
would	0
happen	0
to	0
my	0
mother	1
for	1
uh	0
my	0
brother's	1
are	0
not	1
interested	0
in	0
helping	1
me	0
so	1
i	1
would	1
have	0
to	1
move	1
him	1
down	1
here	1
that	1
way	1
i	1
want	0
to	1
see	1
the	0
nursing	1
home	0
if	0
i	1
have	1
to	0
put	0
him	0
into	1
one	0
you	1
know	1
where	0
i	1
can	0
go	1
see	1
it	0
i	0
i'd	0
be	0
very	1
uncomfortable	1
with	0
him	0
being	1
in	0
colorado	1
and	1

why	1
yeah	1
i'm	1
sure	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
really	1
good	1
nursing	1
homes	1
around	1
dallas	1

yes	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them_1	1
are	1
limited	1
care	1
too	0
where	1
people	1
can	0
do	1
uh	1
like	1
they	1
have	0
apartment	1
styles	1
but	1
that	1
wouldn't	1
work	1
for	0
him	1
i	0
think	1
he's	1
beyond	1
that	0
where	1
if	0
you	0
need	1
help	1
you	0
can	0
get	1
it	0
but	0
basically	1
people	1
kind	0
of	0
have	0
a	0
small	0
apartment	1
and	0
doctor's	1
are	0
available	1
if	0
they	0
need	1
them	0

um-hum	1
i	1
i	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lady	1
that	0
lives	1
in	0
a	1
place	1
similar	1
to	0
that	1
in	1
austin	1

and	0
allows	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
well	0
the	0
only	0
problem	1
with	0
these	0
are	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
very	1
expensive	1
of	0
course	0
i	0
guess	0
all	1
nursing	0
homes	1
there	0
is	1
but	1

and	0
the	0
bad	1
thing	0
about	1
it	0
before	1
you	0
can	1
get	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
government	1
help	1
you	1
just	0
practically	1
have	0
we	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
pauper	1

right	1

it	0
it	1
takes	0
every	1
penny	1
they	0
want	1
you	0
to	0
spend	1
every	0
dime	1
you	0
have	1
before	1
the	0
government	1
will	0
pay	1
for	1
your	0
your	1
care	1

yeah	1

right	1

and	0
that's	1
the	0
sad	1
part	0
about	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	1
s[ee]	0
uh	1
yeah	1
and	0
i	1
think	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
people	0
who	1
do	0
it	0
now	1
in	0
colorado	1
it's	0
interesting	1
i	0
talked	1
to	0
my	0
mother	1
they	0
allow	1
you	0
sixty	1
five	0
thousand	1
dollars	1
and	0
your	0
car	1
and	0
your	0
home	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
could	0
make	1
it	1
on	0
that	1
what	0
she	1
probably	1
would	0
do	1
is	1
disburse	1
the	0
money	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
i	0
would	0
send	0
it	1
back	1
to	0
her	1
so	0
that's	0
[laughter-probably]	1
what	0
would	1
happen	1

um-hum	0
i	1
think	0
that's	0
what	0
most	0
people	0
do	1
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
give	1
it	0
everything	1
away	1

yeah	1
it's	1
unfortunate	1

i	0
i	0
i	1
work	0
at	0
a	0
brokerage	1
firm	1
and	0
i	1
have	1
seen	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
that	0
just	0
have	1
to	1
gift	1
you	0
know	1
their	0
belongings	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
they	1
can	1
each	0
year	1
in	0
anticipation	1
of	0
having	0
to	0
move	0
to	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0

right	1

yeah	1
it's	0
frightening	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
uh	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
how	1
old	1
you	0
are	0
i'm	1
forty	0
six	1
you	0
know	1
we're	1
the	1
generation	1
moving	0
into	1
this	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
our	0
kids	1
are	0
gonna	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
us	0
you	0
know	1

i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
i'm	1

i'm	1
twenty	1
nine	1

yeah	1

and	1
everybody	1
in	1
my	1
family's	1
always	1
had	0
we	0
don't	0
have	1
any	0
children	1
everybody	0
that	0
has	1
has	1
them_1	0
later	1
in	0
life	1
so	1

yeah	1

so	1
my	0
my	0
mother	1
and	0
my	0
father	1
are	0
in	0
their	0
late	0
sixties	1
so	1
i	0
mean	1
they're	1
not	0
that	1
far	1
away	1

right	1

i	0
also	1
fill	1
in	1
my	1
generation	1
a	0
squeeze	1
between	0
looking	1
to	0
having	1
to	0
help	1
my	0
parents	1
and	0
still	1
having	0
to	0
help	0
my	0
son	1
because	0
things	1
are	1
so	0
rough	1
out	1
there	1
job	1
wise	1
and	0
he's	0
still	1
living	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	0
he's	0
ever	0
going	0
to	0
[laughter-get]	1
on	0
his	0
own	1
the	0
way	0
things	0
are	1

oh	1
i	0
know	1

and	0
so	0
it's	1
kind	1
of	0
sq[ueezed]	0
you	0
feel	0
squeezed	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
having	0
both	1
generations	1
but	0
it	0
something	1
will	0
have	0
to	0
change	1
as	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	0
us	0
get	0
older	1
uh	0
luckily	1
if	1
we	0
could	1
be	0
like	1
your	0
grandmother	1
i	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
would	0
love	1
to	0
live	1
to	1
a	0
hundred	0
and	1
two	1
if	0
i	1
were	0
okay	1
but	0
you	0
see	1
these	1
people	1
in	0
their	1
seventies	1
yeah	1

it	0
but	0
yeah	1
most	0

most	0
people	0
aren't	1

yeah	1
most	1
aren't	1
that's	1
the	0
problem	1

and	0
that's	0
the	0
bad	0
thing	1
i	0
would	0
hate	1
to	0
have	0
lived	1
so	0
long	1
she	1
lived	0
by	0
herself	1
my	0
grandfather	1
passed	0
away	0
before	0
i	1
was	0
born	1
so	0
she	1
lived	0
by	1
herself	1
up	0
until	0
she	0
was	0
ninety	1
ninety	0
one	1
and	0
just	0
did	0
everything	1
and	1

that's	1
incredible	1

so	1
do	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
recycling	1
programs	1
there	1

um	1
i	1
don't	1
really	1
think	1
we	1
have	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
works	1
as	1
of	1
yet	1

uh-huh	1

uh	1
we're	1
pretty	1
small	1
town	1
and	1
um	1
the	1
closest	1
thing	1
we	1
have	1
are	1
bins	1
like	1
out	1
in	0
front	1
of	1
wal-mart	1
that	1
show	1
you	1
know	1
plastics	1
paper	1
liter	1
bottles	0
et	1
cetera	1
et	1
cetera	1

oh	1
uh-huh	1

yeah	1

we've	1
progressed	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
farther	1
than	1
that	1
um	1

yeah	1

um	1
actually	1
they	1
have	1
uh	1
parts	1
of	0
town	1
it	1
may	1
have	0
even	1
spread	1
all	0
over	0
the	1
whole	1
town	0
and	0
um	0
they	0
have	1
these	0
green	1
bins	1

um-hum	0

and	1
it's	1
just	1
as	1
standard	1
as	1
a	1
a	1
regular	1
trash	1
can	0
that	0
they	1
come	1
by	1
and	0
pick	1
up	1
and	0
dump	1

yeah	1

and	1
uh	0
just	1
along	0
with	0
a	0
trash	1
can	0
you	0
have	0
this	1
this	1
green	1
plastic	1
bin	1
and	1
you	1
put	1
your	1
bottles	1
in	1
it	1
and	0
paper	1
and	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
all	1
those	0
things	1
that	1
aluminum	1
you	1
know	1
anything	1
that	0
can	1
be	0
recycled	1
you	1
just	0
put	1
in	0
that	0
bin	1

oh	1

and	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	1
you	0
can	1
al[so]	1
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
the	0
restaurants	1
they	1
just	0
have	1
uh	1
places	1
where	0
you	1
can	0
throw	1
away	0
especially	1
beer	1
places	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
throw	1
away	0
green	1
bottles	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
brown	1
bottles	0

yeah	0

huh	1

and	0
uh	1
oh	1
i	0
don't	1
know	1
i	1
guess	1
they're	1
you	1
know	1
clear	1
bottles	1

yeah	0

so	1
um	1
you	1
know	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
people	1
do	1
have	0
those	1
separated	0
and	1
of	0
course	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
um	1
dumpsters	1
uh	0
the	1
the	1
igloos	1

yeah	0

uh	1
and	0
they	1
have	1
those	1
strateg[ically]	1
strategically	1
placed	1
around	0
the	1
city	1

oh	0

and	1
uh	1
they're	1
they're	1
actually	1
gonna	1
extend	1
it	1
i	0
think	1
one	1
of	1
these	0
days	1
maybe	0
to	1
apartment	1
complexes	0
and	0
uh	0

oh	0
that'd	1
be	0
good	1

yeah	1
things	0
of	0
that	1
nature	1
so	0
i	0
guess	1
when	0
you	0
live	1
in	0
a	0
bigger	0
city	1
it	0
it	0
really	1
becomes	0
uh	0
necessary	1

yeah	1
see	1
it's	1
not	0
anywhere	1
near	0
that	1
uh	0

uh	0
we	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
our	1
little	0
pitch	1
in	0
to	0
it	0
we	0
do	1
recycle	0
our	0
aluminum	0
cans	1

oh	1
yeah	1

but	0
that's	1
as	0
far	0
as	1
we	1
go	0
because_1	0
i	1
take	1
them_1	0
to	0
a	1
girl	1
at	0
work	1
and	0
she	1
goes	1
and	0
cashes	0
them	1
in	1
because	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
just	0
i	1
can	1
do	1
that	0
for	1
her	1
and	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
and	1
i	1
don't	1
want	0
the	1
hassle	1
because_1	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
go	0
to	1
another	1
town	1
to	0
do	1
it	0

yeah	0

oh	0
really	0

yeah	0
see	0

hm	1

see	0
we	0
don't	0
have	1
anything	0
here	0
in	1
belton	1
it's	1
it's	1
a	1
pretty	1
small	0
little	1
town	1

yeah	0
i	0
remember	0
my	0
grandparents	1
and	0
i	0
used	1
to	0
always	1
get	1
out	0
there	1
on	0
the	1
road	1
and	1
pick	1
up	1
beer	1
cans	1

yeah	1

and	1
uh	1

so	1
yeah	0
that's	1
about	0
all	1
th[at]	0
that	1
we're	1
doing	1
here	1
uh	1
they're	1
uh	0
getting	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
on	0
they	1
need	1
to	1
a	0
lot	1
a	0
more	1
community	0
awareness	1
of	0
just	0
what	1
is	0
it	0
mean	0
to	0
recycle	1
and	0
what	1
can	1
you	1
recycle	1
and	0
what	1
you	0
can't	1
because	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
do	1
really	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
know	0
what	1
it's	0
for	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
they're	1
doing	1
a	1
real	1
good	0
job	1
of	1
uh	1
separating	1
it	1
here	1
and	0
of	1
course	1
there	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
have	1
a	0
specific	1
place	1
to	1
put	0
your	0
paper	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
they	1
try	1
to	0
get	0
you	1
to	0
go	0
ahead	0
and	0
separate	1
it	0
but	0
uh	1
they	0
actually	1
have	1
the	0
door	1
to	0
door	0
pickup	1
um	0
and	0
it's	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
it	0
started	1
out	1
to	1
be	0
um	0
just	1
kind	0
of	1
a	0
test	1
a	1
pilot	1
project	0

um-hum	1

and	1
it	1
went	1
over	0
so	1
well	1
that	1
they	0
just	0
extended	1
it	0
and	0
it's	1
almost	1
uh	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
done	0
by	1
a	0
private	1
company	1
or	0
not	1
it	0
may	1
be	1
but	0
uh	0
they	0
just	0
go	0
around	1
to	0
each	1
uh	0
door	1
and	0
pick	0
it	0
up	1

wow	1
that's	1
excellent	1

yeah	0

that's	1
good	1

let's	1
see	1
oh	0
and	0
every	1
year	1
of	0
course	1
the	0
phone	1
books	0
um	1
they	1
tell	1
everybody	1
across	0
the	0
city	1
to	0
um	1
put	0
all	1
their	1
phone	1
books	1
in	0
uh	0
the	1
uh	1
recycle	1
bins	0

yeah	1

oh	0

because	1
you	1
know	1
phone	1
books	1
are	0
pretty	1
well	1
for	0
a	0
bigger	1
city	0
they're	0
pretty	1
thick	1

yeah	1
they	1
uh	0

and	0
sometimes	1
you	0
might	1
have	0
two	1
or	0
three	1

exactly	1

so	0
uh	1
that's	1
that's	1
a	1
big	1
savings	0
right	0
there	1
in	0
itself	1

yeah	0
see	1
ours	1
just	1
goes	0
in	0
the	0
regular	0
trash	1

yeah	1

it	0
just	0
you	1
know	0
there's	1
not	1
a	0
whole	0
lot	1

hm	0

and	0
there	0
are	1
you	1
know	0
some	1
places	0
that	0
we'll	0
set	1
up	1
you	0
know	1
for	0
old	0
newspapers	1
and	0
stuff	1

um-hum	0

but	1
usually	1
it's	0
it	0
it	0
hasn't	1
caught	0
on	1
yet	0
i'm	0
hoping	1
it	0
will	1
soon	0

um-hum	0
well	0
the	0
thing	1
about	0
newspapers	1
and	0
paper	1
recycled	1
paper	1
is	0
actually	1
very	0
expensive	1

yeah	0

so	1
when	0
you	0
see	1
something	0
that's	0
on	0
recycled	1
paper	1
they've	0
actually	1
gone	0
to	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
expense	1
to	0
do	1
that	0
it's	0
uh	1
they're	0
not	1
coming	1
out	1
ahead	1
at	1
all	1
it's	0
uh	0
it's	0
really	1
a	0
cost	1

hm	1
i	1
wasn't	1
totally	0
aware	1
of	0
that	1

yeah	1

so	1

i	0
mean	1
it	0
it	0
sounds	1
good	0
to	1
the	0
public	1
but	0
there's	1
really	1
a	1
big	1
cost	1
incurred	1
when	1
you	0
do	1
recycle	1
something	0
now	0
aluminum	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
they	0
may	1
be	0
coming	0
out	0
ahead	1
but	0
i	1
know	0
for	0
a	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
paper	1
uh	0
on	0
that	1
end	0
they're	0
not	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	0

it's	1
it's	0
good	0
to	0
recycle	1
but	0
it's	0
uh	0
not	1
to	0
their	0
advantage	1

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
costs	1
less	0

hm	1
well	1

i	1
can't	0
think	1
of	0
anything	0
else	1

i	1
can't	1
either	0
because_1	0
we're	1
we're	1
at	0
a	0
very	0
you	0
know	0
beginning	1
stages	1
so	1

[laughter-okay]	1

so	1

uh-huh	0

we	1
look	0
forward	1
to	0
it	0
to	0
get	0
better	1
but	0
that's	0

well	1
i	0
hope	1
y'all	1
um	0
uh	1
come	1
along	1
a	0
little	1
farther	1
in	1
the	1
future	1

casual	1
uh	1
usually	1
uh	1
slacks	1
and	1
a	1
soft	1
colored	1
shirt	1

um-hum	1

the	1
um	1
thing	1
that	1
that	1
distinguishes	1
me	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
dress	1
real	1
professionally	1
for	1
a	1
meeting	1
or	1
something	1
is	1
i	1
wear	1
a	1
clerical	1
collar	1
and	1
a	1
suit	1
and	1
uh	1
all	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
but	1

uh-huh	1

but	1
when	1
i	1
don't	1
need	1
to	1
dress	0
up	1
for	1
a	0
a	1
meeting	1
or	0
a	1
service	1
of	1
some	1
sort	0
i	0
don't	1

um-hum	1

is	0
my	1
first	1
morning	1
to	1
work	0
down	1
at	1
our	1
little	1
church	0
preschool	1
and	1
they've	0
told	0
me	1
to	1
wear	0
just	1
something	0
terribly	1
comfortable	1
because	0
these	1
are	0
two	1
year	0
olds	1
and	0
they	0
have	1
a	1
lot	0

have	1
bible	1
lessons	0
and	0
they	0

during	0
the	0
morning	1
but	1
they	0
still	1
have	1
snack	1
time	1
and	1
play	1
time	0
so	1
i'm	1
gonna	1
be	1
dressing	1
just	1
in	0
casual	1
slacks	1
and	1
t-shirts	1
probably	1
not	1
blue	1
jeans	1
but	1
little	1
bit	0
short	1
of	1
that	1
just	1
just	0
tennis	1
shoes	1
and	1
play	1
clothes	1

well	1
around	1
there	1
you	0
can	1
probably	1
wear	1
uh	0
t-shirts	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
but	1
around	0
here	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
we	1
are	1
into	1
sweaters	1
and	1
uh	1

in	1
between	1

they're	0
they're	1
in	1
their	0
play	1
clothes	1
i	1
mean	1
they're	1
in	1
their	0
summer	1
clothes	1
during	1
the	0
afternoons	1
because_1	1
you	1
just	1
can't	1

but	1
in	1
the	1
mornings	1
people	0
are	1
dressing	1
for	1
work	1
in	0
their	1
sweaters	1
because	1

have	0
a	0
a	0
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
people	1
that	0
i	1
know	1
i	0
can	0
be	1
very	1
casual	1
in	0
the	1
evening	1

well	1

that	1
i	1
think	1
uh	1
years	1
ago	1
i	0
used	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
more	0
uh	1
committed	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	0
of	1
a	0

i	1
don't	1
know	1
if	0
they	1
ever	1
get	1
i	1
i	1
really	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	0
details	0
are	0
there	1
should	1
be	1
someplace	0
where	1
you	1
could	1
call	1
and	1
find	0
out	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
i'm	1
pretty	1
sure	1
there's	1
a	1
place	1
you	1
can	1
call	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
the	0
closest	1
you	1
know	1
thing	1
to	0
you	1
but	0
i	1
think	1
there	1
should	0
be	1
some	0
kind	0
of	1
curbside	1
service	1

yeah	1

that's	0
the	0
only	0
way	1
i	1
could	0
really	1

the	1
one	1
in	1
florida	1
is	0
so	1
cool	1
because_1	0
they	1
pick	0
up	0
everything	1
they	1
pick	0
up	1
newspapers	1
and	0
uh	1
you	1
know	1
milk	1
jugs	1
and	1
aluminum	1
and	1
tin	1
cans	1
you	1
know	1
like	1

comes	1
in	0
and	0
stuff	1

uh-huh	1

they	1
pick	0
up	0
everything	1

during	1
the	1
summers	1
like	1
the	0
around	1
where	1
i	1
live	1
the	1
uh	1

they'll	1
go	0
around	1
and	1
collect	1
cans	0

stuff	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	1
we	1
used	1
to	0
just	1
save	1

up	1
and	1
then	1
they'd	1
come	0
around	0
and	1
we'd	1
give	1
them_1	1
to	0
them	1

um-hum	1

but	1
when	0

the	1
winter	1
time	0
i	0
think	1

over	1
with	0
we	0
are	0

have	1
since	1
then	1
probably	1
ripped	1
out	1
half	1

because	0
it	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
incorrectly	1
