yeah they'll just i do too just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1

um-hum	0
yeah but i can remem[ber] remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh yes	0 1
um-hum	0
where oh yeah yes	1 1 1 1
oh i do too	1 1 0 1
yes yes yes	1 0 0
um-hum they really are	0 0 0 1
i- know i know the feeling well it wa[s] okay and i sure will and bye-bye	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
hello	1
hi	1
hi this is lisa	1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
[i]t's kind of an easy thing to talk about	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah	1
um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
okay yes	1 1
yes i know because_1	1 0 1 1
i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess she's in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and i've never faced that at all	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah um-hum i think it's definitely gotten better	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
because_1 women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field i don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess it's kind of an ideal world though huh	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think that'd be a wonderful way to do it	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
and then	0 1
um-hum	0
also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
is it	1 0
that would be great	1 0 0 1
or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on loa to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and sh[e] you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
do you	0 1
do you work like half days or half weeks or	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
hm	0
oh is oh that's great	0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh do you get the full benefits	0 0 0 1 0 1 1
oh that's wonderful	1 0 1
yeah especially_1 with children and so many things going on that would be great	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
either way yeah you have your career and your home life and that'd be a nice way to especially_1 if you have young children	1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	0
oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you're involved in that	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because_1 you've got two days off that you can do everything so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours that's been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so that's real helpful so you don't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour i don't know how many times i've done that to do something post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
so	1
uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because_1 i just it's always been that way but i know	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and wor[k] women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
mean you can see that it's wrong and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i think it's getting better not worse	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
well i should probably get back to my job	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
call again	1 1
okay bye-bye	1 1
okay	1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
well why was cnn the on[ly] of course i think saddam hussein only allowed cnn to broadcast it is that not true	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
well i know even if you watched abc nbc or or the other y[ou] i mean what's the other one uh cbs they all were were tapped into cnn	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh that's the only thing they broadcast an[d] like you i listen to the radio on my job at work and all this week they've been having this uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a discussion about that is why uh why cnn was	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
well i listen to a christian radio station and they were saying that cnn is definitely a world uh news service and uh	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
that was you can't really be sure of the quality of what you got you know	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh we had some uh some people from our church went to israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
and i was watching on tv they they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in jerusalem so we got all fearful	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
and so it really made me question as to what how do we know ab[out] you know uh if the news we're getting is any good	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so	1
yeah	1
right right	1 1
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
well i it i find it depressing to watch or especially tv you know it's uh local news	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
concentrates on murders and things like that i'm from dallas	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
and uh we have a lot of bad stuff it just really gets me depressed even to watch it	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
so then you wake up one morning and you're in war with somebody you don't even know about it	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
so	1
uh we have the dallas times herald and the dallas morning news but i don't	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i don't read newspapers	0 0 0 1
huh-uh i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another it's just something i've never developed uh an interest in	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
it's stolen before i can get out and get it	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
you'd be surprised	0 0 1
they just come by and pick them_1 up even if it's just for the tv you know uh	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
selections of the day i don't know it just wouldn't be there whenever i've tried it	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
so you're right who would steal a newspaper	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
but they do	1 0 1
what part of california are you from	0 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh okay	0 1
huh you work for ti	0 0 1 0 0

this is your first call	1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
oh really	0 1
yeah well i'd i got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten minutes	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
so if we've done our three minutes let's just let the conversation end and say bye nice talking to you too bye-bye	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh for me that's uh mostly newspaper and radio i almost never watch television	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
as a matter of course so i don't get news from television except during the war i watched a lot of cnn because it was so good	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um	0
yeah	1
um	0
i don't know i guess uh i don't even know why i watch cnn i guess i just wanted more news it's one of the few times i wanted	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
more news than	0 0 0
cbs	1
were they	1 0
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
hm	0
um-hum	0
right	1
yeah i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
don't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
but uh i c[an] i'm from california and i can remember being in	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh in these earthquakes and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
you know from anyone else's point of view but they'd get all blown up in the news	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

and they didn't used to be actually but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside so i put them outside once i got a house and they're doing great out there they love it but the other one the first one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
other than that he gets scared to death if you shut that door he goes into hiding	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony and lord knows what happened to him	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
but he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
probably	1
are they	1 0
oh no	0 1
oh my gosh	0 0 1
uh	0
i imagine	1 1

oh oh i can imagine what did he shoot him with	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh	0
oh my gosh	0 1 1
people are crazy	1 0 1
oh lord	0 1

no	1
oh yeah i ke[pt] i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i don't i can't take care of them as well because they're outside and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back and	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things but i can't give them up i just i go hysterical when they don't come home oh j[ust]	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh yeah and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat and you go crazy thinking it might be yours	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
ooh	0
really	1
well it's here now we have to keep it yeah my my first one that i got i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment and it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely so i found this one	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
in a actually it was on a sign at taco bell drive-thru that said free kittens and i thought well that's interesting i'll call them and he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and he was the last one she carried across you know the whole big sad story so of course i had to take him i felt so sorry for him after that and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah he i asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed so but he is the lovingest cat everybody people who don't even like cats like him	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1

i know we wondered about that but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh yes it was absolutely nuts uh but uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

oh yes yes	0 0 0
oh it just drives us nuts	0 0 0 1 0 0
um yeah	0 1
they really are the cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and but oh they're so much fun to watch them_1 play it's just just hysterical	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yes	1
oh we've got uh well the two that were outside	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
they're like brothers i mean i've never seen two cats so close and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house and it is hysterical i mean and then the other two cats will follow in suit it's like this train i under[stand]	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0

oh goodness you get so attached to them	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
my mother has dogs and i'm like no yeah this is nothing like cats	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
right i'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person no it wouldn't have worked	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
oh that's one of the requirements i asked him i said now you do like cats right we don't li[ke]	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes uh-huh	1 0
oh yeah oh the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats are you getting rid of your cats you can't be pregnant and have cats i'm like uh no no no right the child will learn to like cats and deal with them i'm sorry we are not getting rid of the cats	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the whole family was so disappointed	0 1 0 0 1 0
right	1
right uh but yes we just just love them to death	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh well	0 0
well it was nice talking to you too i enjoyed it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
okay thanks bye bye	0 1 1 0
you want to start	0 0 0 1
yeah	1
i agree um the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
um i have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother	0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
go uh and the children are left without either parent now to me that's kind of a drawback	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
but uh i guess it's a price you pay	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
in the uh	1 0 0
uh day care centers	0 1 0 1
well uh from what i understand there's been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh they term it as more uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
creative	1
but uh that they uh are much more contentious	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
so i i don't i i guess we'll have to see another generation	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
to see what differences	0 1 0 1
a child being brought up you know in in a kind of a uh community	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
rather than a home	1 0 0 1
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
so they	0 1
yeah	1
um-hum	0
uh-huh	1
what do you mean	1 0 0 1
uh	0
oh yeah	1 1
yeah	1
that's strange	0 1
a nanny sort of	0 1 1 0
uh-huh uh-huh	0 1
yeah	1
that's right that's right	0 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
uh-huh uh-huh	1 0
right	1
um-hum um-hum	1 0
to come in and live with them_1 to come in and live with them_1	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
right	1
uh-huh	0
and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
in like a classroom or a day care center	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i know the day care centers are not cheap either	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
you know they're	1 0 1
uh well no i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it they have to go with the a single	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh wh[at] i mean a babysitter more more or less	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
but i think it's like about sixty dollars a week	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
for two children if i'm not mistaken	1 1 0 0 0 1 1
and you have to pay that whether you're on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and uh	1 0
uh	1
i think	0 1
i really don't have a vision	0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
i um	1 0
i think that they will be more in the work place because	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh the door's open	0 0 1 1
and uh it's just human nature to walk through an open door	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
so and i would be glad to see that	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
i hope i don't see a lot more single moms	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
but	1
i it seems in my experience i'm running across single women all the time	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
it's awful	0 1
yeah	1
uh-huh	1
right	1
well i think we've done it thank you very much it's been interesting	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
okay bye	1 1
well i guess i would	1 0 1 0 0
first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
um	0
i am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
both in society and in the work place uh	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
there's no doubt about the fact that when i f[irst] was first graduated from college the impression was that	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh now i think the change that i've seen as much as anything is one where	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to sh[are] both share homemaking duties and also how women will	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and i guess that's a significant change that of i've both participated in an[d] and noticed	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
wonder about them in what way	1 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
i have not to be honest had much experience	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
with children in that situation i i guess one knows one's own story and i know	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh in my children's case it was one where uh pretty much up until	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
the older of two was in	0 1 0 1 1 1
uh let's see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um	1
so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they were able to be home together	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
um	0
and we never actually experienced that	0 0 1 0 1 0
what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
generation or so i guess i anticipate um	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um	0
i don't know whether	0 1 1 1
there will be	0 0 1
an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see i just don't know	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
um deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother	1 1 1 0 1 1
sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
a professional mother a person	0 1 1 0 1
for instance that and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh story or whatever i i don't think i have a philosophical problem with that in fact i think it sort of raises	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
uh um	0 0
i i don't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
the var[ious] on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh i know that that my sense is that i have	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
very much an interest and had one in being a parent i i don't know that i	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh i don't have boys that doesn't didn't bother me never has vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes uh a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um i know that there are young people	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means they're young uh	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
that in my work place who are both of them earning rather	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child i could easily envision that pardon	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
or to put their child into a s[etting] into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
and you were paying for really high quality care	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
uh i have	0 0 1
acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that's what the experience they want	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum um-hum	0 0
i haven't ever really looked at them are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
what	0
what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
that's okay too	0 1 1
uh-huh	1
i'm i'm noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place and that that is a little troublesome	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
uh and maybe that's a change we'll see maybe uh p[ossibility] the possibility of of women	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh who deliberately say no we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
so	1
well i think we're about done okay uh good bye	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
you take care bye	0 1 0 1
uh	0
being a former drug user	1 0 0 1 1
i uh i'd i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
uh because i know	1 0 0 1
that uh	1 0
in using drugs i was not a good employee	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
and so i can see from the company's standpoint that there uh whenever you are an employee of the company you are using it's assets	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and uh	1 0
a[nd] bu[t] you're also under their liability under the workmen's comp	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh on my job we had a lot of workmen's comp cases and	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh i work for a tire company modern tire and uh it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our uh injuries occur	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
and what we do is we'll have a drug test i[f] if an if a a boy or a man uh has an accident then he's automatically uh given a drug test	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
yes when he goes to the doctor the first time	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and so that kind of uh i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
now we've let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i don't know how tec would handle it they haven't pursued it you know	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
uh if there's some uh problem i know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and he went to a a separate drug testing firm and they showed it negative	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
uh-huh really	1 1
and then i also had a friend who was uh just around some people that were smoking cocaine and he tested positive on cocaine now then you always wonder well is he just saying that you know	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
right	1
yeah	1
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
yeah because you're endangering everybody's lives if you've if it's something like that	1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
you're kidding	1 1
the executives right	0 1 1
the executives	0 1
yeah wouldn't that be awful if you were	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything	0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
i can't believe i'd was so	1 0 1 0 0 1
brazen before i'm like i say i'm a former drug user but uh i i	1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1
well uh	1 0
i accepted christ as my lord and savior and so i don't use drugs any more	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines	0 1 1 0 1
um yes	0 1
uh-huh	0
and all on the job too you know it had gotten that bad	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
really it's it's life is so much more enjoyable	1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
i mean you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
uh-huh that's right	0 0 1
yeah	1
that's right	0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
uh-huh	0
oh goodness	0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
oh my gosh	1 0 1
yeah	1
uh-huh	1
right	1
well i would think they would be	0 0 0 1 0 1 0
but they weren't	1 0 1
isn't that awful	1 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	1 0
yeah	0
huh	0
yeah that's reminds me of uh i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
and i just you know went oh where	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
let me move as far away as possible	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
but i'm proud though that that um you know i grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
they really have a good campaign for the young people you know they know it's not smart so	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
so i guess it was just a generational thing	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
um-hum	0
that's right and that's good that's the best way to stop it	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
well i think we did it	1 0 1 0 1 0
it's good talking to you yeah bye-bye	0 1 1 0 1 1 1
whoa	1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
where do you work	1 0 0 1
oh	1
uh-huh	0
right do they do it like you know within hours of	1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
the accident or is it	0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
huh	1
yeah	1
yeah i think that's probably true too that's that's that's sort of scary	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah yeah really really	1 1 1 1
yeah that's that's a bad situation i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that i think they should	1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
i'm a ti employee and and and uh i'm i'm really gung ho for it in fact	1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
i you know some of the places now um like ibm don't allow even smoking you know in the in the plant we we have designated smoking areas	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1
but um i work in sort of a building that's that's not really it well it's on the campus of the ti facility but it's a little bit you know separated we lease the building and it's m[ainly] it's a factory environment	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
and uh they they have designated smoking but it's just wide open it's not ventilated properly and i think that's bad but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i think it's a it's a definite i think it's essential	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
in fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years and uh	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know they never they never called me they never you know	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
then finally the day we declared war was my time	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
no and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think and i told him he's obviously in a high risk group	1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
right right and of course you know they they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
but uh-huh	0 0
which i thought was interesting	0 1 0 1 1
oh man yeah	0 1 1
ooh	1
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
wow	1
really	1
well it's really lucky that you got away from that cause that's	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
really	1
downward spiral	1 1
yeah yeah that's that's it	1 1 1 0 1
yeah	1
just life in general	0 1 0 1
yeah well i'm well i'm definitely for it	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
plus you know you you want to think that that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but that are not endangering your life in some cases like uh my husband uh several years back worked for motorola	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and they had you know i mean it was a chemical handling type	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
you know that's really that's really frightening so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0
on on a on a greater frequency than than maybe just you know the paper pushers like like i am	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
well you well you'd think so but uh	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1
i don't know if they do it [un]til yet	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
because when he was at course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at ti i forgot what i guess it was like eighty four	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
eighty five something like that and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
so that's scary	1 1 1
oh lord	1 1
oh	1
yeah yeah should we move	1 1 0 0 1
ooh	1
that's awful	0 1
uh-huh yeah	0 1
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
yeah peer group is the other way now instead of	1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
uh-huh that's	0 1
yeah that it really is	1 1 0 1 1
okay well i enjoyed talking talking to you cathy bye-bye	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
okay well like i was saying burlington's crime it doesn't involve children and what you see on the tv's from you know in washington and new york	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
so what i believe the people want the subject is is big city crime which is something	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
that i don't have any first hand experiences about but i have you know concerns and i have a few ideas of um	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
how to combat it i mean i don't i don't think uh ideally you know you need money to do everything so that's one thing that	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
that's one thing that that's that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money so	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
oh	0
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people's community or does it stay in the bad neighborhood	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
so that's a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh my it sounds like um san juan puerto rico we were there	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
just well for a lay over and um well it wasn't a lay over we were some we had	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
we were staying at the other end the island we drove into san juan to catch our plane it was at night and this boy really wanted to go on the beach and they look at you crazy you don't go on the beach i says well it's a big tourist town	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
you know don't they don't people go for a walk on the beach at night and they said no it's very safe in the daytime but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young and what we have here in burlington which	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
council that they have all these after school activities for kids they set up	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer and they have gyms open	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
after school you might keep them but you again you need that one on one	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
like a big brother trying to keep the the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school it'll get better you know so that your mom doesn't have a job and	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and she doesn't wor[k] you don't know you can be better than that you don't have to live on the you know the for a street life	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
but	0
yeah but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here i mean um they can deal with that scale	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
they might have five hundred troubled youths when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into th[e] well the kids now they're so it's twelve years old and they're	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
selling drugs and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
it's just it's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society but	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if i had a child that that that did things so bad it's not they don't care about anybody these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
and we don't have it so we deserve it and we should take it	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old the parents might be thirty years old	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and i'm thirty years old and i'm kind of irresponsible but i have the morals that keep me from	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
you know if i was going to go out and drink or do something i wouldn't do it in front of my child these people you know they bring their their johns home and they bring their drugs home and the kids are just sitting there in the same room	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
it's ju[st] just that they have absolutely no no morals and it's really sad	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
but i like your idea of education if the parents aren't supplying it they've got to get it from someone else from the schools	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah it's really sad like if they did have a big brother big sister program those those people trying to help the kids the parents might have hostilities towards them	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
you know like you're judging us and i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
it it it's i'm glad i don't live in a big city	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
just because i mean not just because i wouldn't feel safe it's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i don't see and i might see it on a you know a a sixty minute special	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
i know it but san antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
but any big city has a bad section	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yes they're very bold it seems	0 0 0 0 0 0
really even uh even in the worst crime areas in burlington i i can walk the streets i wouldn't i if i did it every night	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
i think there would be trouble in our house so you wouldn't get confronted or anything	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
but i don't think you would uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
someone might grab you mess around with you but they're not going to grab you steal you[r] your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i mean that's you you're gonna have to expect that to happen people are just totally unfeeling uh uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right yeah well when uh we lived in san antonio i grew up around san antonio and it's always been a very large uh city and increasingly growing	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
it's has kind of the split population um there's a lot of retired military uh individuals that live there and then there's a very large hispanic population there	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic uh gang crime in the city and that is uh been the worse thing that we've seen happening uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um the majority of the actual gang crimes like the the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods but the crime spreads out into the more affluent uh divisions through robberies rape	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
and uh car crime there's a very large uh or very high percentage of car theft	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
and san an[tonio] san antonio's not far from the border to mexico so a a lot of the uh cars go to uh you know hack shops and they take them_1 apart and a lot of them_1 go over the border especially like mercedes	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
a lot of those those in the the z uh the z cars the datsun cars end up over the border and uh	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
very much so very much so in fact um for a while there uh they had	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
downtown if you were to co[me] come to a stop light they had a a rash of where people were uh when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
so now uh ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there and uh once you've reached the	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during th[e] during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys and um	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
you know or or alone if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have th[e] the river patrol cops it's very nice	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
but at at evening um again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice but you don't want to get off the beaten track um	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
there's a lot of parking garages there because um parking is very tight and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage um alone	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
it's just so sad you know it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more um in san antonio i don't know what the answer is uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
education i think is a lot of it um so many of the kids are are drop outs um uh	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
they ha[ve] there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels i think education helps a little bit there um	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
they again i don't know really what steps there are that they	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh that's good that sounds like they've got a lot going on there	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh yeah i don't know how you combat that i i don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids um	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
so many of them all they see is just the gangs and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah	0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
and i don't know how you combat that i rea[lly] i don't know what the answer is to that problem you know i i do[n't]	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
and what do those kids do they get it at school and come home what do they do then i i feel i feel for them i don't know how to make it better for them or	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
you know unless because it they can't remove themselves they can't just leave and say okay well it's not acceptable i'm leaving the big city mom and i'm i'm going off you know when they're ten they have to live in it and	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
right i think so and uh	0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh yeah	0 0
yeah	0
uh-huh no in san antonio it was like every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
uh-huh oh yeah but	0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
but there's a lot of them it's very prevalent a lot of the the crime is very prevalent	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh very much when we moved here to monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above carmel and um there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
around here and um those that aren't there's celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
um migrant hispanic farm workers uh people that are down and out and uh they all seem to congregate in celinas not so much here in monterrey	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so it's it's pretty quiet i've bee[n] you know we walk the streets at night and uh people run in the park and you know you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
right	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
uh-huh oh	0 0
well i didn't know that about burlington i'll have to keep that in mind	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so	1
are you a freshwater or	0 0 1 1 1
freshwater	1
um-hum	0
most of my fishing has been in the saltwater	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
huh	0
mostly deep sea fishing for	1 1 1 1 1
grouper and bottom fish	1 0 1 1
and uh	1 0
huh i have caught	0 1 0 1
one or two small sharks	0 0 1 1 1
and uh yes	1 0 1
put them back	1 0 1
no no no i love shark steak	1 0 0 0 1 0 1
but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything uh	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
is there a limit i have no idea i know i my home is in uh pensacola florida so	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1
it's they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
and um a certain period of time during the year they have	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
all along the gulf coast from i guess from galveston to mayport they have uh shark tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater uh fishing not	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
oh for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call uh brim and those sorts of things but	1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1

full day trip you know three or four other people and do	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1

the uh the party boat captain could not understand	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
you know he even even he started baiting my hook and holding holding the uh the fishing rod	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
right and it was it was really really really bad uh i as i said i am a fisher i'm not a catcher but uh	1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0

some of the	1 0 1
inlets and the rivers around rehoboth delaware	1 0 0 1 1 1 1
they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker i don't know if you've ever heard of it	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
um-hum	0
and this is the ugliest	0 1 0 0 1
fish i have ever seen and i me[an] and they come in all si[ze] you know i've i've caught them from you know three or four inches long	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
up to uh i guess the la[rgest] largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
no no	1 1
they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
well the first time i went uh surf fishing was in	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and i threw my line out	0 0 1 0 0 1
and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh two feet long and scared me to death i i had never seen anything and then i was fi[shed] fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
and then i	0 0 1
felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here i'm really going to get one	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and i pulled	1 0 1
okay	1
mostly freshwater uh yeah i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in galveston with my parents and	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to to do anything and i didn't know anybody who had a boat now so i don't fish too much in saltwater	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh really	0 1
oh neat	1 1
oh really	1 1
what'd you do with them	0 0 1 0 1
you didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
do they have a limit on sharks i mean is that like a a sport fish can you actually catch those and there's no limit	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
right	1
right	1
oh really	0 1
right	1
uh-huh	1
uh no i haven't i don't know that i could do that that looks awful tiring	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
did you	0 1
didn't like it	0 1 0
it looks complicated to me it's a rhythm or something	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
catching tree bass right did you that would have been something	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
so do you do you fish mainly for trophies or do you do you eat what you fish	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
right	1
right	1
you just like to sit down and watch it right	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
really	1
right	1
right	1
that's nice	0 1
well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1
um most of it i haven't been really in a long time last time i went i actually was in galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun um but	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um i went fishing at i don't know if you've ever heard of uh lake worth it's a fairly new lake in texas	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh we went fishing there last memorial day and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep i was so excited and um	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
that's really about it mostly just the lakes around here and i i fish to take home and cook i don't i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i wanna i want to say i brought something home i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
really	1
everybody but you	1 0 1
it had to be you you couldn't catch one to save your life right	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
how funny just hoping maybe he could fool them_1	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
right	1
yeah	1
right	1
oh yeah	1 1
that would be fun	0 0 0 1
right hand picked	1 1 1
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh rockport which is close to corpus	0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and uh we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
and something i had a rock to weight it down	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm i'm sure it's not a fish right	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life it had real teeth like human teeth	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it's mouth	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say it's a dogfish from everything i've described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
it it was the strangest thing it oh i'll never get over that to this day i don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i'm sure one of those fish are there	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
i've never heard of that one	0 0 1 0 0 1
that's where it gets its name obviously huh	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
um-hum	0
huh	1
can you eat them	0 0 1 0
ooh i i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly but	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
oh that's like this dogfish it was it scared me to death	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
it was u[gly] it really it didn't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh	0
well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do uh once they have that then they can start looking in	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway it's it's your core education your general requi[rements] general education requirements um	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't i don't know what advice i'd give them go to the school you'd like to go to that's what i did	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i didn't care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh political science	0 0 0
where are you at	0 0 0 0
well yeah i guess everybody's in dallas that i talk to i'm in north carolina	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah right	0 0
sure	0
oh yeah	0 0
um	0
uh-huh	0
yeah it does um i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration and i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided to hell with it i didn't want it	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um and from that point i went to law school and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean that's that's where i wanted to be but i didn't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney i just wanted a law degree	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i like	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and you don't have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to so that's that's what i'm pursuing right now	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
and i'm pretty happy with it so far	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah that's probably very useful	0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah yeah	0 0
oh good grief	0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldn't do this everyday no way	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
i am a dis[gruntled] i am i am just a disgruntled person all around i'm the uh i'm the uh original uh mister scrooge i guess	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah bah humbug yeah i just	0 0 0 0 0 0
oh you probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
well that remark in itself is a slam my best friends are lawyers you know like like uh you know my best friends are blacks	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
jewish now blacks and i guess i i guess uh iraqi now is the	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
and it doesn't become fun anymore	0 1 1 0 0 0
yeah you going	0 0 0
oh yeah yeah if if if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
it is	0 0
yeah very much so yeah it's it's a lot of that um it it was enjoyable for a while	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
um but it's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
to do it if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard and i aged ten years	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
but i i i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world i mean it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
what branch were you in what branch were you in i was too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it uh uh command post	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i was just wondering were you in sac by any chance	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
were you in sac	0 0 0 0
sac	0
oh okay i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh r c one thirty fives	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh	0
well that's	0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
that's right and it	0 0 1 0
and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
uh-huh sure	0 0
that's true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at mcdonald's	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah i was the same way too i'm not a people person i i i hate um	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
having to play such a nice guy you know especially when it's all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i it's just not for me i'm uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
which is why i'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
information about selecting a school	1 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
uh do you do you feel that the first two years that the um depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah what was your degree in	0 0 0 0 0 0
political science oh okay well i kn[ow] i know i'm going to school right now and uh i have a friend uh utd university of texas dallas	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i know well that's where texas instruments is	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0

a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public	0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um institution	0 1
and uh it's a lot cheaper my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
and she found out after that she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money this is about twenty years ago but uh	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
well right now i just i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1

and some psychology so it's all working together the only field i'm not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires about four or five different fields really	1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1

yeah it's i i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful i i see i see that happening	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
uh-huh	0
yeah i i went to a language school and and that was a it was a an	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
i guess uh united states institution it was i was military at the time and i i think probably the biggest huh	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i was in the air force yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
yeah well what was your job	0 0 0 0 0 0
uh	1
i was i was a linguist	1 0 1 0 0 1
hum	0
in tac	0 0
uh no i wasn't	0 0 0 0
no no i didn't i didn't go flight crew matter of fact i didn't make it completely through that through that field i was i was in intelligence school and about three weeks short	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i didn't make [i]t i sort of washed out	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it's it's something you know i think that's why you know children really need to	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
think about the field they're going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about they actually should do some reading and they should study it	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah i i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
oh and i tell you what i worked at mcdonald's as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some people that i you know you just came to the point where	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i mean and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a la[b] as a lab technician and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
um-hum	0
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
that's good i was just wondering um	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
getting back to the school thing so i mean i	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
i i almost wish that there was some	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
it's it's hard to[pic] topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes well yeah i am	0 0 0 0 0
um act[ually] actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in new york city or washington dc	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
well that's really too bad because i[t] it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in florida what we learned	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
oh they they have that down there that	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them_1 there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if they're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yes are they going to move to uh mexico	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them you know if the industry comes	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large ibm plant has something to do with the top rated high school	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
because your parents are engineers or chemists they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah you hope well i think i i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0
i can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader i don't see where she's going to have much time for him so i don't know it's just like	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t[o] to see what they need and not overinflate it	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're in a recession here	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
so	0
yeah but i always see it's all it's all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime it it's it's all money based	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
who knows bu[t] maybe we do we need some more catholic schools support the church instead they seem to have done a the good job in the past	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school so	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah the i don't	0 0 0 0
yeah i don't know if i would do that to my child though but so hum pretty much though see i don't have any good ideas or	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
is it	0 0
well that	0 0
well	0
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's it's university of vermont um	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
state school	1 0
okay but you're excluding high-level education	0 0 0 1 1 1
okay	0
yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to arkansas and texas after living in ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
right	0
well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
because we were so far advanced and uh the you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
so you know i i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
but uh you know	0 0 0 0
right	0
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there's no point in you know i'm an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them_1	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
right in high school	0 0 0 0
right	0
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
and	0
right	0
yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them_1 just want to go play	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah that's true i'm wondering with the boom down here it's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
so oh i don't know	0 0 0 1 1
about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now we're we're we're behind down here	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
i say we because_1 i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
right	0
you hope	0 0
i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the govern[ment] the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from is it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
starts hitting closer to home	0 0 1 0 1
yeah they're a lot more strict	0 0 0 0 0 0
you uh have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the university of texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
i i don't think i'm getting what i should but you know in texas it's next to free because th[ey] they pay so much of it it's state supported	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to mit my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of mit and that's it's really too bad	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and col[lege] junior colleges that don't have the background for an mit kind of curriculum so	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last genera[tion] well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from well	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
take it back thirty years i'm going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1
period an[d] and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
until the kids you were little	0 0 1 0 0 1
yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and then	0 1
and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
who are totally prepared to tea[ch] to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
and uh we'll see how the generations go huh	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did i've i was an engineer with uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
mechanical engineer with t i	1 0 0 0 1
and uh i did it for six years	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
and and it just drove me crazy	0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i could not do either well enou[gh] i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess[ary] or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
as is you know as is needed and because my husband had had for a long time was out of the country	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
also with uh with work for like three months and and	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
yeah	1
it might have been better	0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer i'm i'm i'm a photographer now	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
that it would just have to be a hobby and i'm i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
to do	0 1
yeah and it['s] it's great while they're really little but as they get older	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different i mean it he goes to a a mother's day out program now once a week both of my kids do	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
and so they're getting they they get the socialization with other kids and y[ou] you know and not really school but	0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah i think they do too	1 0 1 0 1 0
and i need it for the break so	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	1
and enjoy it that's that's the whole thing	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
ten year[s] even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
because if if i if i had been allowed to work	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and now with the photography that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and and use those hours to do the the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so my kids	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if it's you know an[d] an[d] when he's at home can take care of them	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
it's going to have to be both	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
you know it's just convincing your husband that's important or that that that it's important enough for him to do it because if he saw mom	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it	1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
in that other you know uh that i should do it or tha[t] or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this is what you do it now no	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
yes and	1 1
yeah and without and and it's just they don't look at things most men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be do[ne] this is the time this needs to be done but	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's right	0 1
yeah	1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
needed to be done they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and it's gonna	0 0 1
it's gonna yeah some kids are really having it if they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because_1 i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
but if no one does anything when they're little	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yes i understand i i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but i think	1 0 1
if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know i know mine almost never did	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
so well you['re] you['re] you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah you you weren't supposed to want a job	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
yeah	1
um-hum	0
yeah but but	1 0 0
but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
did you	0 0
um-hum	0
oh yeah	0 1
so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're going to be there	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
but uh if you're going to be more pro[fessional] professional oriented	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
that doesn't really go with the family	0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah	0 1
oh okay you've found something else	0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	1
yeah	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
the same person every day	0 1 1 0 1
yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and if it's not	1 0 0 1
if it's not mom then then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father's attitudes about you know who[se] whose job is this	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
well it['s] it's his job too and i to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
so uh	1 0
to m[e] yeah to yeah to m[e]	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah well	1 1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
and you you you	0 1 0 1
yeah you talk yeah	1 0 1 1
yeah	1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
an[d] and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this and i agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and and that's a very hard attitude to change	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
hm uh	0 0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
to so that they know that uh you know male and female are both responsible for doing this and	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
and uh	1 0
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
yeah	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
and i i think that's happened in a lot of cases	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
um-hum um you know some time day care is really good but sometimes it's just it's baby sitting it's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
relationship with the adults to say you know here's what's right and here's what's wrong and and here's what we expect of you	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
yeah i'm i'm saying this as i'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah well she's usually in bed by this time but she's staying up late tonight but yeah you know i want to i want to have a relationship with her you know m[y] my dad was a very traditional dad and when i was a child i didn't really know my dad very well and i miss that	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
and i want	0 1 1
yeah the men have to be convinced of that	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
no	1
where do you get most of your news	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
where where are you oh yeah	0 1 0 0 1 0
no i'm in san antonio	1 1 0 0 1
um-hum i get my news from a combination of sources i take the the paper everyday and i read it on the way in to work on the in a carpool uh-huh and uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
and i watch the uh actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work and then you know usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
oh yeah	0 1
um-hum	0
yeah um one of the women that i work with her husband is iranian	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
well i i uh i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i understand that the macneil lehrer probably doesn't	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in in every little town	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
i've been getting a kick out of those lately	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
although um	1 1
i'm i'm only twenty five so i've never actually been through a period of war and i don't know anyone in the military and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff and i thought the generals were very interesting now when they started to speculate i	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i saw that for what it was and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on but i thought they were the[y] they were interesting and and they shed some light on what was going on for me	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0

you know one of the the best uh television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on abc and it was for children and it was hosted by peter jennings	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1

on i don't know what you'd call it other than on line they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
informative and interesting and uh i was real impressed at how abc handled uh	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

and our local heb stores here i don't know if it's heb statewide or whatever but they have videos	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
that uh i don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh it was it was	0 1 0 1 0
right it was something for children	1 0 0 1 0 1
that that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0

back during the vietnam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
the that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
covered by the news	1 0 0 1
yeah i tell you what the first three days i was glued to the television	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
and i had	0 1 0

um and friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
because i was watching cnn and they would they would switch back to the one of their israel bureaus and the people would be standing there in gas masks and you'd be hearing the sirens and it was just i was amazed	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1

no there are two and they're pretty close	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper i grew up near houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff i mean it['s] it's	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
piddley stuff to pick a newspaper over and i enjoy the comics are better in this newspaper like this newspaper has the far side and some other comics that i enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of so	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
and my fi[ancee]	0 0 0
my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers he takes both san antonio papers an austin paper both houston papers i guess he takes seven the san marcos paper and the new braunsfel paper	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
but he's a football coach at southwest texas state university so he's getting all the sports sections	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and so you know he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread unless	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i watch the macneil lehrer news hour and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i'm in dallas	1 0 1
are you in dallas also	0 1 0 0 1
oh really okay	0 1 1

i normally find that uh i i'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends so i don't we don't normally talk about the news at lunch	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work um the macneil lehrer news hour is on uh public television and i enjoy that quite a bit	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

i will admit i work with uh someone who's iranian	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news he's very very skeptical of the news media and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
but he's i don't know uh he's	0 1 1 0 0 0 0
mu[ch] much much more so it's it's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the gulf goings on um	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
he was always speaking in terms of you know american imperialism reasserting itself and i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

true um the	1 0 0
they um tend to spend	1 0 1 0 1
quite a bit of time on one story they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time sort of like the uh what is that abc's nightline	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh well i guess they only normally stick with just the one um story but they they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
no no it's very much national interest news a lot of times they end up um	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
with these panels of experts and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions and sometimes that i i don't know the value of that because um i saw plenty of jokes and and um	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0

it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it and they seemed to mold the events	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1

yeah i i didn't see anything like that although i did uh i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting this is getting a little off the topic but	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
there there is a a big push you kn[ow] with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with um counselors	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
to to help parents uh learn how to talk about their war with their children i thought that was a really unusual thing	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

i[t] it with the children's aspect um-hum	0 0 0 0 1 0 0

i suppose that is a valuable service that again not having uh lived through another war i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of or if that was	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
a a new concern with people	0 0 1 1 0 0

that's true that's true	0 1 0 1
and probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that that people's interest didn't flauge too badly	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
i will admit the same thing i would come home and flip on macneil lehrer and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and i i was just i was	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0

i i didn't have that experience i i don't have cable so i i'm pretty much limited to pbs which i thought i thought they did a very good job	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um i've got one question for you i	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
you say you take the newspaper	0 1 0 0 0 1
um	0
i i found the newspaper situation in dallas very interesting we've got	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the times herald and then the morning news which has a very strong subscription	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
does san antonio ha[ve] you said san antonio right	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
do you have just one paper or do you have several	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

i i actually take both newspapers on the weekends i figure i'm only taking on the weekend and i can afford that i i find the news reporting in the the	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
mourning news to be better but i i sort of have a liberal political slant and the mourning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
still i i get the times herald just to balance that out a little bit	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
okay um i guess um	0 0 0 1 0
this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
but um	0 0
um well i've made a lot of baby gifts it seem like that's like especially lately there's been so many babies that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um	0
isn't that funny no	0 0 0 0
yeah isn't that funny i guess i do have one thing um a friend of mine gave me a clock kit and i i needlepointed the the face	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
and i uh kept that because she gave me that so	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh yeah and it's real neat	0 0 0 0 0 0
um basically the the whole well no i guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they're like hearts	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
and then the at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh what's that	0 0 0
huh	0
wow well that's interesting what did you what kind of things did you do	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
oh	0
yeah	0
tha[t] what did you call that	0 0 0 0 0 0
huh that's i've never heard of that before i've probably seen it though i mean when you described it	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
but um i've never heard of it before and it's really interesting	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i've kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0

that's	0
yeah it is	0 0 0
oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons um i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
they make them they like i don't know how to explain it they make them hard you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
i've never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
um	0
oh definitely yeah	0 0 0
oh	0
oh	0
yeah	0
that's i think that's what my concern was you know wasn't really sure and how they would how they would last	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
you're right no that's true though that's funny	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
oh i know	0 0 0
that's funny no i just um	0 0 0 0 0 0
i don't i have really have gotten out of it i don't do it quite as much as i used to	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um i guess because i i went back to school so i don't have as much time	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
now and i have two children also so that it keeps me very busy but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know it's really	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
it's so relaxing to just sit and but once i get started i can't put it down i just	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
i know i started a project	0 0 0 1 0 1
it's been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for christmas and i	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
that's what i keep telling this person well i didn't tell you what year	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
um well it's a it's uh cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and trees and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
not as much as i'd like to you know it's just so hard	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh uh well i shouldn't it's counted cross stitch actually is what i'm doing and so it's really since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work yep	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
yep	0
no it really isn't and i tell you really i could just kick myself for even starting it because i have a feeling i'm never going to get it done i'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
no that's true i i just don't know when i'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
but i really do en[joy] like i said i really enjoy it when i do it's just hard	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh and there's there's so many other things that i	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and wall hangings	0 1 0
and so you know those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
and do them	0 1 0
no	0
no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it's	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don't usually use the colors they tell me to and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
there's yeah there's a a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many real simple ones you know i do i've made i made a little uh	1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
it was really easy i mean just	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
just did a thumb print you know	1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
and then see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple and it ju[st] it didn't take anything at all and	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
and then i just	0 0 0 0
oh really what kinds of things have you done	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
aha	0

i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and and it it's kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh well can you go to so and so's house	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

oh	0
i did some needlepoint years ago and then i got into the bargello	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
well it's an italian um	0 0 0 1 0
needlework using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh hum the	0 0 0
what what kind of cloth uses that i i've just gone blank but it's used wi[th] uh with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
what i did when when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth and	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i can't find one that i've done it it's one of those things i didn't i didn't give them away but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
or or what and it i was so proud of them when i got them finished	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
but i have no idea where they are	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
bargello it's b a r g e double l o	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
i suspect you i suspect you have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
me too yeah that's interesting	0 0 0 0 0
how did you know to choose this subject tonight that's funny uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh what how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas[kets] how were you decorating the baskets	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um	0
like fabric that's been stiffened in yes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i've seen some and there there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
when i do um crochet it's it's usually the the lacy victorian type	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
things like that and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture it's like white glue	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don't know i was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
uh high humidity	0 1 1
in in a room	1 0 0 1
do you know what my concern is how will i dust this thing i'm terrible	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
so many of my crafts well right now i'm looking at a little uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh quilted uh uh hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors uh and i hate to dust so that's the first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh you don't have time	0 0 1 0 1
you definitely don't have time	0 1 0 0 0
that	0
i have a similar problem i've got to have time or i don't even want to get into it in the first place	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
you just didn't say which christmas right	0 1 0 0 0 1 1
what was this project	0 0 0 0
now this is this is done in the needlepoint hm	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yes yes i do know i have done a little bit of that but i've decided that that's something that demands my time my my to[tal] my total attention	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
and so i've got to have	0 0 0 0 0 1
total almost total silence i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh	0
i'm sure you'll get it done but it just maybe not on the original obviously not on the original time schedule	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay	0
um	0
that's what i would do too	0 0 0 0 0 1
or or whatever i have that's	0 0 0 0 0 0
ooh	0
what	0
with ink or oh okay	0 0 0 0 0
oh that sounds really neat did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay so you just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
just like being finger printed	0 0 0 0 0
well what would you have at a dinner party	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
oh gosh that sounds great	1 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but you know i i wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
guest but if it was a formal uh dinner party i would probably think of something else like um shrimp shrimp fettucini is real easy	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
to um make and everything and it's usually well liked by people i guess i'm just a seafood fan so i think on the lines	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah um you're not supposed to i mean you're not supposed to eat them_1	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
dead i mean well you eat them_1 dead but right because_1 if if they're dead for too long you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because_1 their tail straightens out and you're not supposed to eat those because_1 they're the bad for you	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah so if you ever go in a restaurant and order crawfish i mean every once in a while you'll see o[ne] i mean it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then yeah don't eat it but um you just put some cajun well	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
lots of pepper and you just boil them and they're absolutely wonderful but there's uh they're a pain to peel for some people once you get used to it they're real easy but um you know if you have nails or anything you can	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
plan on those being shot	1 0 0 0 1
i think for a dinner party i i don't know it depends like if like	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no i they would shell their own you know we'd just have crawfish and beer or something but um if it was more formal like if i was you know working environment then i would probably um sh[ell]	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
shell them_1 or at least disconnect them from the head but there's a there's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head so um	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
it it would just depend that's the best part of the crawfish sucking the head but um	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
i don't know it just i[t] it just depended on what type it was i guess but you can buy uh the crawfish tails already peeled an[d] everything and	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
you know make a sauce with or something like that but you can go ahead and buy them_1 cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
um yeah it really does i like shrimp better	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
just um but crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own it also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use and stuff like that but um	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
i think that and also to get totally off c[rawfish] the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
that's what i need	0 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
oh	1
i bet that that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
that would be fun	1 0 0 1
uh huh	0 1
sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something well that's you know that's fun	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh huh	0 1
that sounds right i would i'd take him up on that	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum maybe i that's about how much i can cook you know i'm i'm doing a lot more cooking now	1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
then i used to but that's only because my mom just started working so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon so i try to have things cooked for her but	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh um i usually try to stay out of kitchen i don't know not one of my favorite hobbies but	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she um every christmas and and easter whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
and it has i don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are just absolutely delicious i don't know what she calls them and i don't i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol but	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um	0
i don't know i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh	1
yeah	1
oh that would be wonderful	1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
um-hum	1
oh	1
um-hum	1
well um how long do you cook the meatballs	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
uh huh	0 1
oh yeah	1 1
hum that sounds great especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance i mean like if if you are having a dinner party on wednesday night you could do it on a weekend that would be great	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
i'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because i hope to have lots of dinner parties because_1 i like to i mean i'm	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company and i know that my future husband will be you know he's going to be working for chevron in houston so he's going to be um	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
you know i'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
oh yeah i have to impress the boss and clients because_1 um i'm in i'm in public relations in school so i'm going to have you know my whole job's going to be based on my clients an[d] stuff like that so	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
i'm gonna have lots of dinner parties and have to take them_1 out to eat and	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
right now i am taking a class on etiquettcy and all the little bitty things that i didn't even know i mean i thought for sure i'd been raised properly but i'd been doing a lot of things wrong i didn't know about	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
but um so	1 0 1

oh yes you need to try them_1 oh they're wonderful	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
well uh lately since i have children i've cut down on having dinner parties but when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
uh i have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball it's called burgundy meatballs and it's made with r[ed]	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
red wine and um it's it's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when you're ready to um to serve it that's one of my favorite things to to serve	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1

uh-huh	1
okay well i'll remember that	1 1 0 1 0

yeah we have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
all the time and yeah that's what i wish i had but in our family i'm the one who who cooks and i i really enjoy it it's gotten a little more difficult with kids but i really do enjoy cooking	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and we um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and we we was really a lot of fun and	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah it did and we we tried to be	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
fancier or more courses than the other or uh it was a lot of fun you know it something unique you know and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh uh elegant theme or you know it was a lot of fun	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
that's right	0 1
it was fun and and we threatened to make the other two uh	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying i'm	1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
it does except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to uh	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
make sure that they didn't have to do it again make hot dogs or some potato chips or	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
oh that's nice	0 1 0
it can it can be fun i if you have the time but you know a lot of times it's too it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah it's um it's in the other room i don't know if we have enough time for it it's real easy one of the unique things in this like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um what ever seasoning usually just light seasonings like salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
which is something different um makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop them_1 up real fine but um it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
and then the sauce is just made with um bouillon cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
so it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um chinese food	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies and it gives it a bit of a different consistency	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
uh browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease uh then what i usually do is i freeze them and then when you're ready to serve them	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it probably you have to heat it up for a good	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh if they're frozen you know it may take a half hour for them to thaw out but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself let them simmer in the sauce itself	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
that's real good	1 0 1
right and then freeze them	1 0 0 1 0
sure	1
yeah	1
uh-huh	1
yeah you'll meet friends invite invite the boss over and and the friends at work	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
sure	1
oh really	0 1
well	1
i i think we've we've covered the subject i've got some interesting information about crawfish i was in fact i was it's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh i will i'm sure my husband will be	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
surprised because_1 we were talking about them the other day even before	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
well i don't know i've i've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to uh the radio and and watch tv about the different uh things that are happening i uh i'm against it but on the same token um i went out and purchased a gun just because i	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1
wanted the right to do that so i i have a rifle in the house um the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it but uh	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
i bought it for target practicing and uh and also because i wanted a weapon	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh how do you feel about it	0 0 0 1 1 0 0
hm	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
well up uh up in new england where i'm from uh y[ou] you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammu[n]it[ion] amm[unition] ammunition	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
and i thought that was really good and i think it they uh takes two weeks for that system to process um your request for uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition you have to get a p[ermit] permit from the police station in your local area to do that	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah um	0 0
i i i agree i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh to	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
to stop the impulse buyer from um buying it quickly and and um maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it but if someone's really determined to to pick up a firearm uh you can pick it up anyplace and you can get them really cheap	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
how long was the waiting period out there	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ah that wasn't too too bad	0 0 0 0 0 0
because i[f] if you're gonna go buy something um of of that nature i think you've you're gonna have some idea as to what you're gonna do with it you're not gonna react that quickly in other words you know you [d]on't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
yeah i do too uh because it doesn't make any difference uh uh whether it's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose they both do the same kind of job	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh yeah i suppose i'd never got shot with either one but i don't know um i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
oh	0
uh i've got a a manual singled shot and i guess it doesn't have any any automatic features to it the further away i get the the uh wider the shot gets from the target	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it's got a hell of a kick to it	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
do you belong to a gun club or you uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
um-hum	0
no kidding	0 0
huh well the the um uh clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive but uh it's well worth it you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and so[me] targets and have uh competition	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
um i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire uh there's an annual membership fee	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
uh that's that's fairly high plus there's initi[ation] initiation fee that you have to pay as a first time uh uh member	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars just to join the club plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
i think the the gun clubs serve a useful purpose in fact i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
and you know it it even a[fter] after you wait your nine days if you don't know how to hand[le] it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive and you give him a license because he waited nine days	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
he could he could not only um uh shoot himself he could he could uh mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
wow he was fortunate he could he could of hit something else	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
wow	0
how about_1 uh private citizens selling uh weapons like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
huh how do you feel about that do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the um buyer and the seller and or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh because you own it	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah but is[n't] isn't there a way to um to deregister yourself after you register a gun	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
because i	0 0
have	0
yeah is it registered	0 0 0 0
the um the rifle that i've got is not registered and um i don't know why i never registered it but the uh	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
um i'd i'd i think it's it's voluntary the um the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah i guess that could happen it's just like the uh the social security system once they uh they gave everybody a number and now they're making you um uh get one at at birth	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and once they have your number they have you know your identification and if you try to to do anything um like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
and that's true	0 0 0
that's all right yeah you were talking about uh um fed[eral] what the federal government knows about people	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
they probably do	0 0 0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
do you find it difficult picking up uh guns that that are not registered	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
no i don't either i can i can buy some uh today if i wanted to just you know put up the money	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
and there's there's no waiting period on that	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
you sell the refrigerator yeah	0 0 0 0 0
hm yeah i think the federal government is um is really far away from uh	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
um control i i don't believe in um should i shouldn't probably say control i mean regulation control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have b[ut] um but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
so that they know who has what weapons	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
yeah	0
unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money so i can't complain too much	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
uh well what would you say your opinion is on gun control	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
well i think uh down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and i think they need that uh now i do have a i have a pistol it's a little twenty two and i have a twenty two or a twelve gauge shotgun	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
and you know i do like to have my guns uh i don't know if i'll ever use it	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
you know and like you my bullets to my little pistol's probably uh about three years old uh my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
but uh i like to have them_1 where handy	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i've never heard of anything like that that would be nice but a[nd] you know the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
i know i i uh th[e] i had a waiting period on my pistol because_1 i was down in uh tennessee and uh they had a waiting period and uh	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
we bought it there and	0 1 0 1 0
about_1 nine days	0 0 0
no no	0 0
yeah somebody want do th[at] i i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does	1 1 1 0 0 1 0
a shotgun's got too much of a spread or at least ours does uh it you know you have a little uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
thing on the bo[ttom] bottom of th[e] on top of the barrel where you a[s] you turn it you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get and the spread changes	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah my husband had a uh	0 0 1 0 0 0
a police gun at one time and i shot that thing one time almost knocked me down it was just a little i don['t] i forget i think it was a three fifty seven i'm not sure	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
he belonged to one awhile back	1 1 0 1 0 1
uh since we mo[ved] we've only been here in texas for about a year uh we can't even find a place to shoot just for target practice	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
but i'd love to get used to that shotgun we traded his pistol for that shotgun	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah well that's what uh my husband wh[en] when he was in it gun club when they's done that it you know he went mostly just to um shoot at paper targets	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
that's a good i've never thought of that that's a good point	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah that and yeah	0 0 0 0
and well we uh we was living on a navy base down in memphis and uh this one guy decided to play uh lonesome cowboy or something and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
well he went tumbling down the steps along with	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
uh shooting his foot almost off he broke his leg and a collar bone and couple of other things i'm sure being mister cowboy i can't remember what the na[me] term was going around it was about four to five years ago but	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
naw th[e] i guess that would be a good idea	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh that's a hard one because_1 we did that but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it i'll uh	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
you know the person who sells the gun ought to protect themself because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are gonna come to you	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
ah i have no idea	0 0 0 0 0
i've only had one gun and i've kept it you know uh the one gun that was in my name	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
i don't think you have to register a shotgun	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
well see uh my husband has a thing if they go to	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh regulating uh all right uh banning guns o[f] pri[vate] private pri[vate] private ci[tizens] citizens this my kid is jumping on me i can't hardly talk um	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
my husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
and everything about you	0 0 0 0
uh i bu[t] you know they know it from how much money you make a week to uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0

oh the social yeah they pr[obably] they probably know everything from half the time wh[at] ho[w] what time you go to the bathroom	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
no that's that's a little bits extreme but they could know anything and everything about you and uh i'd like to have my gun if they go to banning banning them_1	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
i'd lose my gun but we wouldn't lose our pis[tol] or ou[r] shotgun and uh we're wanting to get a couple more that no one knows about but i don't i don't uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
naw	0
yeah w[ell]	0 0
yes well you can look in the uh the we got the thing down here called a shopper	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
it's a a who a it's a it's a bargain thing uh you go and everyb[ody] you know i always see guns in there five to seven guns a day it comes out every tuesday	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1

yeah you know and i'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
yeah well i'll agree with you there they do have too much control over us already uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah i guess so	0 0 0 0
i don't know they're	0 0 0 0
okay this topic is is russia a threat to our security i think they're more of a threat to their own people	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
at this day and time how do you feel about it	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
i believe communism is very much waning it's uh pretty much on the way out of the door in so far as the strong hold that they used to have	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
and the russian people are all realizing that the communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world	0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and their rebellions right now	1 0 1 0 1
is the result of that i[f] if they can get the army or the military to sway to their side i think that uh it will be on the way out eventually	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
it's just a matter of time because in the baltic states they've already massacred	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
so many people who protested and that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
for the	0 1
regarding the uh outcome of their	1 0 0 1 0 1
affairs	1
what's your synopsis	0 0 1
uh-huh i think that it went up a thousand percent on most	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
um-hum	0
but gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
he's moving towards a two to three party system	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
of government that nor eliminating or diminishing the communist power and i guess that's where yeltsin steps in	0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
so far as his politics of government goes uh but i don't know how convinced the people are of him yet myself	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
um-hum	1
yeah uh i understand it	1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
i agree what's bad for the soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food but somehow it just does not get out	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
to the market the way it should	0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah that's probably more true	1 0 1 1 1
than a lot of people realize	0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
it seems to be headed in that direction too	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
well their knowledge with uh better communication processes	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
in this world now that's reached them is more educated than to the uh ways of the western world	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
and um i think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
of changing things	1 1 1
to	1
they probably not enough but i'm sure i lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
that they have gotten wind	0 1 0 0 1
of what they're missing out on	0 1 0 1 1 0
yeah i'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah what we consider just	0 0 0 1 1
i don't know	0 1 0
normal everyday things to them is real luxury	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
which is unfortunate for them	0 0 1 0 1
and of course most of us we don't really appreciate what we've got	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
because we've been so used to it	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah i agree	0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah i can go with that answer too the only yes i could go to is if uh a renegade crew decides to launch an attack	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
or an accidental launching of something to that effect to for to a nuclear exchange but i don't even see that occurring uh because their	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
internal strifes are more important right now than	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
adapted to i guess	1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
well they do have uh a major internal problem everybody wants to defect and i can understand why um	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
i think their biggest problem is just you know obtaining food to live so when you have the basic needs uh being unmet i don't think you think globally as far as you know	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
being a threat to other people in the world so as soon as they get their their own home country taken care of then they'll consider what they can do with the rest of the world	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
well i do i do realize that um uh the bush administration isn't too happy with with how they're handling their internal	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
um strife you know as far as diplomacy is concerned i think it's been a good a good uh positive direction for um the soviets as far as yeltsin is concerned you know he was um	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
allowed to what wh[at] in his in the in the congress they they gave him more power as far as his republic in russia is concerned which is gives him more power overall which i think is a good sign	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
that there'll be some you know politically speaking you know he's going to have more power and i think it's a step in the right direction i think gorbachev realizes that he's got a a major uh	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
uh power figure you know competing against him and i think it's gonna be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with yeltsin as far as uh realizing	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
well he does realize it you know with the fact that they reduced the uh or they increased the prices on their food food and goods uh	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
it yeah tha[t's] that's incredible but they had to um go in the direction of a market driven economy and and they had to bite the bullet for that so that's a good move on on gorbachev's part in doing that	1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
so	1
well that's all they got right now that's their ray of hope so you know they'll go with you know w[ho] whoever comes through for them i it it's just that	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
w[hat] the weird thing is is that gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates as far as with glasnost and [poistroi[ka]-/perestroika] perestroika and stuff and i think he's caught between the old guard and and	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
the new uh glasnost um i think it's kind of uh escalate to a point where it's out of control and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how in order to keep the peace on peace on both sides	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
so i think that's where you know kind of where he's stuck you know what i'm saying	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and that's the that's the situation that he finds himself in and you know he's a tough guy i mean he's been through it so i have no doubt that he'll i mean y[ou]	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
i i think overall he's been a a good ah figure for the the soviet union i mean i think his intentions and his ideals are are uh well intentioned	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
and in the long-term but i just think that because of	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
the basic needs that the people don't have i think that that makes the problem most severe	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
and makes him look look worse that what his um what his ideals are	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
personally	1
i think it's i think it's a lot of uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
oh how do you put it bureaucracy and and and uh one thing and then all the corruption i think there's a a a large amount of corruption	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
on the the have and the have nots	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
you know i	0 0 1
i know you're going to have that with every society at least we're more blatant about it but it's very secret and it's been going on for years i mean you can't change things overnight	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
and but if it gets to a point where people can't survive i mean there's revolution you know and that's	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah big time major but you know that's that's what happens when you know the cork blows and you can't handle it anymore i mean that's	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
that's the way the world uh	0 0 1 0 1 0
you know revolves that way	0 1 1 0 1
i really question though how much technology the average soviet	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
is exposed to	0 1 1
yeah i think they're starting to realize but i i just don't think they have the resources if you were to compare uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
the americans to the soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines fax machines and cellular phones and state of the art equipment that we are so used to i don't think they even realize what's out there and to what extent	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah all the major conveniences of life	1 1 0 1 1 0 1
yeah	0
this is true this is very true and we it's human it's human nature though to take things for granted and it kind of	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know when you've lost something or or uh uh don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize you know	1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
what's out there and what you know what you have and what you don't have	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
so the original question do we think they're a threat to our you know a s[ecurity] s[ecurity] security threat	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
um yes and no	0 1 0 1
um no	0 1
well i don't really feel that the soviets really want to blow up the world i mean	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
um we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as as	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
nonfeeling machine type people and they're people just like us i mean you know they get up everyday and they put their pants on the same way and they have to eat and everything else and i just don't feel	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
that	1
and all right what have you seen	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that's i knew you were going to say that i wanted i want to go see that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
gosh	0
yeah i i i i watched uh costner on the academy awards i was really happy that he got i was hoping he was going to get best actor uh but he he he did pretty good on that one	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
yeah yeah i'd i bet	0 0 0 0 0
yeah there several of them that are out right now that i want to see uh dances uh silence of the lambs	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
nah nah	0 0
people	0
yeah	0
yeah well you know they they that's what they said about the exorcist you know no no it's terrible you'll have nightmares you know i watched last weekend me and my roommate we we laughed about it	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
well i'll tell well i guess i i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was yeah he's a very good writer and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know it was	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah and of course i was i was living alone at the time and it was late at night and scary and you know you start hearing noises you know	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
and there's rats in the attic you know	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh let's see there was a couple of others that are out and i can't remember	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah i i didn't i didn't even like the previews on that	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
no	0
i don't i don't much care for michael j fox anyway	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
i saw the original back to the future and then i i know i hardly ever go see a sequel	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
i mean i think i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh two thousand and ten was far better	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
two thousand and one was a good movie if you had read the book	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you c[ould] say what is this	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
you know what's the significance of the apes you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh the book is really good i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again and that's one of them it's it's so well written	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0

never show any anyway anything that i ever wanted i rented a lot of videos because_1 the closest movie theater was barry saint edmunds and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
a lot of a lot of people did but it would have to be a good show	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
yeah i i use they they they have all these neat phrases you know you know the like critically acclaimed that's what they say when the thing hasn't won any award	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1

yeah yeah	0 0
yeah from love canal	0 0 0 0
waterfront property here at love canal you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that's wh[at] i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
okay so the latest movie i've seen that i thought was fantastic was dances with wolves	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
oh man	0 0
i i just finally ended up going to see it uh and one day my husband had the kids and i just went because we couldn't we could never get to go see it together because it's so long by the time we had a babysitter for that long	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
so i finally just went to see it and i just thought it was fantastic	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah	0 0
that was quite a the buffalo scene in that thing was so real it's like i mean it just blew me away	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah	0
uh i'm i'm afraid to go see that one that one looks so scary just from the previews i thought gosh i'd probably have nightmares for the next six months	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
it's supposed to be good though i know some friends who went to see it	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
they said it was really riveting	0 0 0 0 0 0
well you're not a thirteen year old okay i don't know i saw it when i was a kid and i thought oh man	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh uh-huh	0 0
oh really huh gosh	0 0 0 0
oh boy	0 0
oh gosh call the crisis line	0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i bet	0 0 0
oh gosh	0 0
i saw one i thought was crummy with that new uh michael j fox movie the hard way where he plays a a actor that's uh like th[e]	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh i know it was well i ended up at the theater and there was didn't seem to be anything else on i wanted to see so i'll try that but it wasn't worth anything i didn't care for that at all	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah well the last two i saw him in one of those back to the future part three deals and that was crummy also i didn't think that was any good so	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
oh boy	0 0
yeah yeah	0 0
well i hadn't read it and i couldn't figure what was going on half the time so	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah yeah	0 0
yeah yeah i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
wow huh	0 0

huh well i have one i bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids otis and milo	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
oh that is that is the most precious movie it has w[as] to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life and it's all this it's the story of this little cat and dog and it's not	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
like cutesy it's just uh it's just so realistic everything they do you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things and it was	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
a real dog and cat and all the other animals they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised and then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
all over creation i don't know where in the world it is somewhere in china somewhere i think that it was filmed	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
but uh it's just really an incredible thing	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah it was pretty wild and of course the only sound is dudley moore narrates it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
but there's no you know nothing else to keep it going but it really keeps	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
keeps me going i i've seen it twice now	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
huh	0
yeah it was like the best of the walt disney ones walt disney's kind of	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
gotten worse in my opinion in the past few years	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
yeah all those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
oh boy	0 0
hm	0
that's pretty good	0 0 0
really	0
let's see what are some other ones i've seen lately i'm trying to remember i can't oh i just saw one on the video oh um have you seen the gods must be crazy part two	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that is a riot yeah the first one was really good but the second one is really good too i was really surprised	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
no i thought it was funny but that's my sense of humor i guess	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
it's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore and i'm just i guess i'm just middle america or something i just go to be entertained and	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
and not really interested in some of the like the terminator or some of the schwarzenegger stuff i just	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
yeah	0
freddy's revenge part twenty five or whatever	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i never	0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah yeah i've never seen any of those	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah i can't either he seems so macho i just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah when they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
that's like my husband does that he can watch them over and over and i'm there's very few i would want to see that many times so he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
oh yeah that was a good one i haven't seen that one in a long time	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
oh boy	0 0
uh-huh	0
oh	0
huh	0
yeah i bet	0 0 0
gosh	0
oh boy so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh really well when i was in england years ago and i went to to like shakespeare's and you know stratford-on-avon and all that and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it because it was so short the ceilings were so short but	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
oh boy	0 0
yeah	0
yeah yeah	0 0
did you see any movies over there i remember i went to see don quixote over there when it came out it came out right around the time with sophia loren	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
and that was a riot to see that	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah because_1 when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
go see a movie but	0 0 0 1 0
huh	0
oh boy	0 0
uh-huh	0
oh boy	0 0
yeah	0
that sounds great	0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
oh boy	0 0
probably some of them did	0 0 0 0 0
yeah it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by and	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
yeah	0
oh i see	0 0 0
it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're you know if you're two miles away from water	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
water view	0 0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
i drive a honda prelude and	0 0 0 1 1 1
oh yeah	1 0
i bought mine a year ago so i'm not buying a car any time soon	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
yeah	1
yeah it	1 1
well i i like where all the controls are	1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
they're they're in good spots and i i have an automatic i can't drive a standard	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
but um i it's and it's	1 0 1 1 1 0
supposedly real reliable the only thing i've ever heard about hondas is that the breaks go out first yeah	1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah	0
i had a buick regal	0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
the buick was was great it was nine years old and and it was still going strong and the only	0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
problems i had had with it in nine years that i owned it i had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
and	1
that was the only major problem that i had i mean i had little piddly things like i had to replace the muffler and i had replaced the tires and	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh seems like it had a radiator leak once but i never had any major anything other than the compressor	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
no hm	1 0
well i never w[ell] well i kind of know how to drive standard but i've never owned one so i had[n't] i don't drive one a lot so i don't f[eel] feel comfortable in traffic with it	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
and for everything i've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and	1
and resale value is really important to me	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
really	1
i did pretty well with my uh regal because it was in really good shape but it still looked real nice the the interior was still really nice there [what'n/wasn't] cracks all over the dash board and stuff an[d]	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and it had some some nice features so i ended up okay with the buick	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and i anticipate the same thing with the honda whenever i decide to sell it course i may never sell it	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
i may drive it till it's dead but	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
oh	1
hm i wasn't even looking for a car when i bought this car i uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
i was thinking about buying a prelude from a friend who was moving to new york or something so	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
and she was gonna sell her car because_1 she didn't need it anymore and it was only like a year old	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and i had never driven uh a prelude so i went to a dealership because they had like uh the same year and same model of prelude on their used car lot and i went and i test drove it	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
and you know i just fell in love with this brand new white prelude	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
you know two liter si with the the sun roof and the moon roof and i i bought it loaded	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
i mean	0 1
yeah	0
yeah i went there looking at a used car and two days later i bought this car i i felt i felt like	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
that was the worst impulse that w[as] that was the largest impulse buy i had ever made the oth[er] the two other things that i've bought on impulse are vcr and a washer and dryer i go for the big stuff	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah i got	1 0 1
i got my buick as a high school graduation gift	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah but i i guess this [what'n/wasn't] really an impulse i mean buying it right then and you know right quickly was kind of impulsive but i'd been thinking about buying a new car for three years and i was just scared to	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
i was scared to start taking on payments because the buick was long since paid for	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
buy a buy buy a used car sure	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
well um like on hondas	1 0 1 0 1
they supposedly the maintenance records are supposed to be registered with honda or whatever and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars and you can have them_1 checked out by mechanics and stuff	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
mean they can't stop you from doing it so	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
well and even if they didn't you can still get a good idea from a if you can get a good mechanic to check it over real carefully and check the blocks and everything	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
so	0
okay well i enjoyed talking to you	1 0 0 1 1 0 1
bye-bye	1
what kind of car do you drive now	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
do you i drive a honda accord	1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
yeah me either i just bought mine uh it'll be a year in august	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
i love it though i love hondas	0 1 0 1 0 1 1
i think i found my car	0 1 0 1 0 1
right	1
oh really i have a standard	1 1 1 0 0 1
oh really i hadn't heard that	1 1 0 1 1 1
what did you have before you bought that	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
did you	1 0
i had uh mazda rx seven before that and that was the worse car i've ever driven in my life	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
really	1
really	1
yeah	0
right	0
i never really had anything major with my mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end i had it five years	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and the last year or last two years it seemed to go out really easily i think it went out twice in two years	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and that's that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the honda but i don't think i'm going to do that again i think i'm going back to automatic now	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
right	1
right	1
yeah it is	1 0 1
that's true	0 1
yeah it is me too that's why i got the honda hondas have great resale value	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
the mazda definitely did not not at all	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
they're worse than american cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
right	1
good	1
right	1
yeah that's what i did with the mazda drive it till the till the clutch went out and the wheels fell off so probably what i'll do again	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
but i really like the hondas i like foreign cars a lot	0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
i looked at the mitsubishi galant i was looking for a four door car having driven the rx seven so long and it was so small	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and it's really impractical so i wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of and i looked at the galant and those were really nice and you can get them_1 for a great price	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through so that's how i ended up with a honda	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	0
oh yeah	1 0
they're nice i think	0 1 0 1
oh yeah	1 1
oh yeah i have to have them_1 loaded i i love all those little things that you don't need but they're so wonderful	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
i would say	0 0 1
yeah i noticed	1 0 1
mine was definitely not impulse i really needed a new car mine was just it's getting worn out i guess from being a sports car i drove it kind of hard	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and i got it right after high school so	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
by the time i traded it in it was ready ready to go	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
did you	0 1
right	1
right that's same with me would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
like	1

oh they're plaques with you know different kind of animals and then you have their birth date on them_1 and then you have a little picture of them and you frame them_1 and stuff but nothing steady just	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
when i get some spare time here and there i'll work on it but you know it's nothing that i can really	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
no not at all	1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0

and you know you can go to any like a flea market and stuff and there's just tons of stuff everywhere and	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know people just do it in their garage and then on weekends they go out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1

um-hum	0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
okay_1 well i think i think we're okay i think we did done five minutes so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore okay well thank you	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
thanks bye-bye	1 0
so tha[t] the topic is hobbies	0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah who has spare time um i don't really don't really do any handicraft things like that i used to i used to do like salt dough ornaments and things	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
but that was oh good many many years ago and i have i really my spare time i usually go do aerobics and	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0
read and that's about it	1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah family well we[ll] that's what i meant by salt tha[t] we we did that like as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it like during the christmas season making them_1 up for other people and things like that but	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
as far as i've just never been very skilled at far you know needle work wise and the things i've tried to do just don't look very good an[d]	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
it's not like you sit and knit every night yeah i don't even kn[ow] how to knit and my mother used to knit you know all the time and and i don't even kn[ow] how to knit and i'm like that's a lost art from this family	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
so um but it's not a very good topic it feels like if you know not when you're n[either] neither one of us are really	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i i h[ave] seen things i really like you know that were done	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
especially like needlepoint needlepoint cushions and things but it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it you know that and that the petty point and things like that it's like god it j[ust] just seems like it's	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
easier just to go out and buy it already made	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
and see they do that as their job whereas you know for us i[t] and they make it cheaper for us to buy so	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
but and i i mean i'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because i can remember when i used to do you know those little salt dough figurines and things it was it was relaxing you know creative you felt very creative	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
but it just was so time time involved you know so much time involved and the different steps and things	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
so and	1 0
yeah so	0 0
okay i hope you have a good rest of your weekend okay bye-bye	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
okay um yeah one year public service for everybody	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
is that that was it right	0 0 1 0 0 1
i don't know i've been i've been sitting here thinking here because it was you know took a couple tries before i found somebody well you know i'm like i'm not really sure what i think about this um	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
uh i mean the first thing is the oh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory i mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know but	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you know senators' sons and all that stuff too i mean everybody's got to do it um	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i don't know it'd probably be it'd probably be good i just don't know if you know if i was eighteen or whatever i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
yeah is um	1 0 0
uh-huh	1
well i guess it's going to depend on how i mean if if you're talking about any if you're talking about something that's like a full time	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know you're going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff i mean	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i you know i don't know	1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	1
well an[d] and also you know you you you feel more like you know you're actually part of the community if you've done something in it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
uh definitely	0 1
right	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
oh uh that would be a nightmare	0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and just i mean just getting getting it going	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah	0
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
n[o] uh no	0 0 1
not yet	0 0
about_1 six months we will	0 1 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
yeah they have that here um they've got um in most of the states around here i think uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
you know down in north carolina there was a big controversy for a while because_1 the uh the local chapter of the kkk wanted to uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
um to participate in it and uh there was a	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah well uh it was it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know should these people be allowed to or not i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i think virginia's got it and i know maryland does and we just we went to indianapolis last weekend and back and um i'm pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in ohio and indi[ana] indiana about it and pennsylvania maybe pennsylvania	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
i don't remember for sure now	0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
yeah and but then they lost too much business	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh well the thing about that is though it's got a i mean because it was i mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that and	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue and i i'm worried that it it might you know it'll it the same thing will happen it's like you know environmentalism was really big for a couple of years and then people like well	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
you know i'd rather rather spend you know fifty cents less on uh on on such and such you know and even if it's not environmentally safe who cares you know	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
well	0
yeah uh uh well wouldn't	1 0 1 0 0
it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say uh coming from where you are in texas	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
right	1
yeah	1
right well my dad's in the in the solar energy business	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
so um you know we're acutely aware of a lot of this but you know on the other hand he voted for george bush so um you know i i wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
well the the thing with bush	1 0 0 1 0 1
right uh	1 0
who wants to start this one	1 0 0 1 0 0
right right	1 0
i'm not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision uh i mean uh that that doesn't sound right	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
um i guess i see overall beneficial if we're if we're just going from that point of view	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um i you know in the past i don't know i don't know how old you are but when i was uh in high school was uh beginning of vietnam and so forth and many of my peers were being drafted	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
but i i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that that they could help the country in other ways	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and i guess i see that as as not so much a a demand but but a privilege it's it's kind of uh uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
it's something i[t's] it's since since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest i just see that as maybe a good idea i wouldn't mind doing it at forty four	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others uh and i i guess i i can't see that as being something to really object to	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
i could see a a full a run a gamut of different kinds of opportunities things that need to be done that wou[ld] that could be done in an hour or two	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on saturday or something like that in addition to what one does	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh besides that i i can't imagine what kind of uh	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time oh you're going to go to this camp and you're going to you know like um	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
back in the depression the ccc the the construction corps that went out and did things that was great it was needed it gave folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
um i don't see that as being necessary now i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh i i guess i see all of us benefiting and i i don't see it just relegated to the young	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
but i see i i see so much going on that that's bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem something that they turn back	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
that's right you take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and i i see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives it may not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
because then you're you're coming in contact with it it's not as meaningful for me to go to minnesota and do something up there that i'll never be able to see again unless i happen to go on vacation up there	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
it's so it almost needs to be something that has more	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
impact for the individual on going	1 0 0 1 1 1
but as far as putting that into work i don't want to i don't want to deal with the with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
i i see a lot of things like uh scouting uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
boys clubs girls clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing and and i guess i don't see	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh this being that different	0 1 1 0 1
but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
do you have kids	0 0 1 1
oh well good good you have a little time think about that i guess i i have uh when i was teaching school i saw many ki[ds] so many kids that were at loose ends	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and that didn't really have a purpose and i can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
i know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have but that's uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
tha[t] that would be a part of selling it to the community to the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation there'd definitely have to be a major pr campaign in each community each county	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh parish or however the state was divided up	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
hum i may well i don't know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee[p] and i i've seen it in other states too i don't know	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
um	1
and there were those that said no you can't do that i'm sure	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
oh and i hadn't even thought about that uh the oth[er] the other end of that that that's an interesting uh situation i hadn't thought of that	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
we had visited relatives in virginia not too long ago and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and i don't know about your part of the country but uh down here in the last y[ear] oh year plus i it was las[t] beginning with last year's earth day	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
there's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns and e[ven] i work for texas instruments and they they've started some recycling campaigns that	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
a year before that had been turned down because_1 they said well it's not feasible it's not a good idea	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
and i see that as being	1 0 1 1 0 0
i i see that as being a a a change um it for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing it's just thing	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
a part of everyone's consciousness	0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
and if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up but	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
burning out of control in in the persian gulf and and so forth just just every little bit does	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
it makes me feel better it it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
that's that's right because	0 0 1 1
uh no no because if	0 1 1 1 0
we what was it in seventy four when we had the the last last oil crisis an[d] and uh we started getting smart and and we were looking all these alternative sources of energy and so forth	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swung the other way and we need those reminders	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
ah	1
i'm sure you are	0 1 0 1
well i thi[s] you know just about anybody you could name whether i voted for them or not uh makes um uh	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
decisions that i just can't go along with but uh that's why they're there and not me i don't want the i don't want the stress and the strain	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
okay	1
um i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know ti is a very casual atmosphere	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and uh what i usually do on the weekend is is lay out five outfits	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
and uh on monday i i wear the the worst looking one because and it doesn't seem like people are really are you know are that alive on monday you know so	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
and then progressively through the week i'll i'll wear nicer looking things and then on friday most everybody wears jeans jeans and sweatshirts	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
or you know jeans and blouses or something like that	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh pullover sweaters or	0 1 1 0
uh	0
you know little two piece dress suit[s] suits like but	0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
uh-huh	1
right	1
right like where i work it's it's pretty casual um	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
it's it's i guess it's more like a a college campus also i mean there's hundre[ds] you know hundreds of people work for ti	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and um a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and they dress up like when customers are coming in or uh when we have department meetings or something like that and um	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their the real um higher ups like the the lawy[ers] the ti lawyers and uh	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
those that work for the the higher executives those secretaries	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
they uh they really dress up all the time so there's a good combination in the hallways all the time you know	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
uh-huh uh-huh	1 1
uh-huh	1
and that's very acceptable at ti i believe at ibm they they make you wear a blue suit and uh some kind of colored shirt and a tie	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
i wou[ld] i would hate to be in that atmosphere	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
uh	0
oh	1
i see	1 1
yeah oh ti is everywhere	0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
that's true that's a good idea	0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
the no	0 0
right	1

because_1 there is so much smoke in the air	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah areas the smoking area you know it's closed in and if you don['t] if you don't smoke and you go in there tha[t] everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when when you go in there	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i used to smoke a long time ago i used to burn my clothes talking about getting back to clothes i used to burn my clothes with cigarettes that's one of the reason that i stopped	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1

i'm going to be able to make my own clothes	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
right	1
right because clothes are s[ome] are really expensive you know uh uh a little simple shell shell blouse you know that you can make for about	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
say ten dollars at you know at at the most out of a decent fabric	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
boy runs you like twenty something dollars in the store	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
just a little shell to go under a suit you know	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
right especially t[o] to pay that kind of money for it	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
i have a friend who um she had a she had a ba[by] a little boy	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and uh sh[e] she used to dress him out of neiman marcus i mean she dressed him	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
oh fabulously	0 1
and then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff and she finally learned that you just can not do this you know	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
so now she	0 1 0
finds the basement sales and just like you know everybody else	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
right	1
yes and your[self]	1 0 0
right	1
and yeah and you just have to keep buying them	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
you know if you if you if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
right	1
right	0
like i bought i bought the most	0 1 0 1 1 0 0
beautiful sw[eater] uh sweater	1 0 0 1
from uh i believe it was ross dress for less	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
and it wa[s] it was really pretty it was just you know it was just plain a plain uh ro[und] you know round uh necked	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh sw[eater] sweater	0 0 1
and it had	0 0 1
uh like it was embellished around the the top you know it had uh leather leather designs and	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
um	0
some othe[r] other little things on it and i just thought it was so pretty and i go[t] i got it at a real good price i think maybe it was nine ninety nine or something and it was so pretty	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why it was	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
why it was it was so cheap	1 0 0 0 0 0 1
there was in the middle of the back of it there was	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
it's like there it had been slit and they had like just sewed it back together	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
right in the middle of the the back you know wasn't a seam or anything you know	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
and that's why it was so cheap although it's not it's not really noticeable	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
um from the outside but but still it's you know it's really not not not a good quality	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and then i was told by somebody that works for jc penney's that um ross ross is just one of those places that sell[s] sells seconds	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah um	1 1 0
they don't really buy the first quality they buy the second	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh places like jc penney's that they'll reject the seconds they'll send them back every time but	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
places like ross dress for less and uh tj max um uh-huh	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
uh you know that's a good way to approach it i've never thought about um i do plan my clothes a week in advance actually i plan them a month in advance i usually do a month at a time so i don't repeat an outfit	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
but um i've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on monday because really no one's paying attention but anyway	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um i really i don't work outside of school um i work in the computer lab at school so i can just wear whatever i have on for school and	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and um	1 0
and really it's	0 1 0
i try to dre[ss] dress presentable but very comfortable	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
like um in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or or pants i usually um you know college is so casual you really don't want to dress up unless you	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
so	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
oh	1
well that's good that they're so casual i mean uh my brother works for ti and he's a computer programmer or computer engineer	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and um you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear uh a tie or a dress shirt everyday but uh he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt and tennis shoes and he just loves it	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
that's what i've heard	1 0 0 1
but uh i mean they they just moved into the new building he calls it the new building i don't know it's where all the executives are	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
and um	1 0
and so they were they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans but he just left for italy today at four	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and he'll be over there until july first setting up some kind of computers for them	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
over in ti mean for ti but over in italy uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh yeah he was so excited about going	1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
but uh he didn't carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude that well if i don't take it then they won't make me wear it because_1 uh he just	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
he didn't you know he's not really into all that he would wear it if he had to for his job and all but you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um blue jeans and a t-shirt so	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
but i think that's great about ti and also uh to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff i think that's great	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
oh really do you smoke	0 1 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
i think that's um	0 1 0 0
well um y[ou] you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh	0

oh me to boy i have to h[unt] hunt them down	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
that's great	0 1
i wanted to take a sewing class at school but i just haven't fit it into my schedule yet but that i mean that can really benefit	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
um that's something that i'd be very interested in very interested in learning	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh they're outrageous	1 0 1
uh-huh	1
yeah it's it's marked up	1 0 0 1 1
it is it is really outrageous but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom i never understood this then but i do now but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
um or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that and she always told me it was because i was still growing and she wasn't going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

always	1
yeah it it depends on um	1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah there's there's always a reason why they're on sale	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
so that that has a lot to do with it	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0

chevy van it was a short van that had the the three fifty in it	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
and basically it it was a motor and you didn't have all the other junk around it and you could get to it to work on it	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah the hardest part about uh water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah	0 0
yeah	0
i don't think i'd know where to start with a diesel	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
well that's true	0 0 0
i think the onl[y] closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop uh when i was in high school and uh we used to overhaul farm tractors basically	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
and they were nearly all all diesel but as far as cars i've never never been involved with them	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
well ye[ah] yeah and you ca[n] you can get to them	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
well i	0 0
yeah	0
i'm	0
i guess you're right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why one of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at i su[re] i don't know if it's still	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh limited like it was i don't notice it probably because i don't huh	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah i don't i don't notice but maybe because i'm not looking for it yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
but you you got the you got the three fifty in the van	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah that's what i like because they've got plenty of power and uh	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that uh detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i'm convinced that the small v eight like the the mustang's original two eighty nine or some of the chevy two eighty threes	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
were good little v eight engines that were not gas guzzlers but they had enough power to pull all this weight and the four cylinders just don't have it	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
i think those g[uys] those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
oh yeah	0 0
yeah	0
yeah that's kind of like	0 0 0 0 1
the the first well my first car was a fifty six mustang and uh over the years uh all i had a uh dodge pickup several years ago and uh i can't remember the size of the engine it was a three o seven or something like that	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
but uh i remember working on those cars you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things now you open the hood and it's scary like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
my dad's got a new um i guess it's an eighty nine or ninety uh chrysler something or other it's one those transverse mounted v sixes front wheel drive	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
and uh he was showing it to me and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean and you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front and i said well where are the other three	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and he had never really thought about it and he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off yeah it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
right	0
yeah the antismog pumps	0 0 0 0
and all that stuff loads the motor down	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
so it's trying to push the weight plus	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
have all this drain on it from all sorts of	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
belts and things	1 0 1
but that's one good thing i've got a uh eight ninety uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
chevy blazer now and it's got one uh belt on it a serpentine belt	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having i've got an an olds tornado that i think's got six belts on the sucker and i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
oh man	0 0
you bet everything else's got to come off first well it's a pleasure meeting you	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh i've got uh five stickers here from ti so i guess i've done probably uh i'd say seven or eight of them	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so i don't know if if it's tapering off or or what is i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting uh answers so it sounds it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
people or either not or maybe they're burned out or they're through with it anyway let you go thanks for talking bye	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i had a similar thing that i've worked on cars ever since i was uh a kid and that was some time ago but i've gotten to the point where uh the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that uh	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
oh most of the cars i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh yeah yeah basically that's it	0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i've got uh an eighty four chevy van that's uh a one ton van with a camper conversion on it	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
it's got the the the good old three fifty standard engine in it regular gas engine and that engine i understand i can i can actually work on that engine	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
uh-hum	0
right	0
yeah	0
i had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
well that's true that you're right you know by the time you've finally got down to it i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
a few years ago i had an oldsmobile diesel and uh the uh it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it and uh i bought it when we were living in lubbock when i came back here i brought the car back here and uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff and uh the injector pump went bad so i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
found an outfit down here to rebuild it and uh i reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh well if you know diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
and uh	0 0
yeah	0
well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm tractors you know what are about the size of your	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
thumb and the yeah you can get to them and the ones in in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i've had a lot of good service out of that car but uh uh i finally gave it to my son and he drove it literally into the ground you know he was out at tech and he he finished it off	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
what the availability	0 0 0
you mean the diesel availability	0 0 0 0 0
yeah well i'd bought uh a gmc diesel pickup	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
and uh loved that thing you know i really liked it but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
needed and it was the van that i needed then to buying the you know traded it in on the chevy van but uh i sure enjoyed it	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
yeah yeah the three fifty regular gas engine	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah well	0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
think that little the little chevy v eight when it started out in sixty in fifty five i think was two sixty five something like that little	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
you know not a hold lot more than the than the six cylinder that i think was like about for about two thirty five or something but uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred small block four hundred that was uh the same block you know just just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more yeah	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
well that was uh that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
the two little cars i've got now	0 1 0 1 0 0 1
bought a mitsubishi mirage here a couple years ago and and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
yeah	0
the friend of ours over here he's got uh sixty five or sixty six mustang with the six cylinder	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh i was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road it's amazing	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah	0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the three fifty with all the	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you know like well actually i guess here within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it the three o five was that that v eight that they put in the the three quarter and and half ton van and it had all the air pump and uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh i don't know all that all that stuff and all the antismog stuff and uh boy that was uh really a mess back under there under the in that van	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
oh it's that one that's about uh what an inch and a half wide got a bunch of groves in it	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck you know when one of them breaks it's not the outside one it's it's the it's usually that power steering belt or something that's way back in there everything's got to come off	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
yeah and we'll uh how many times have you done this now is this	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah i hadn't uh hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last uh this is the first one in a week or so and	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
if it's	0 0
winding down or what	1 0 0 1
finding a taker	0 0 0
yeah well	0 0
okay all righty bye-bye	0 0 0 0
okay what do you think about it	1 0 0 1 0 1 0
oh yeah	1 1
uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby	1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
but that will be it or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work i mean i[t] it really is coming to that because most women	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
right	0
now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didn't have to work i mean i didn't work i i needed to but i didn't	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you wou[ld] you know	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh yeah	1 1
right right well it's getting where you can't hardly afford if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
and i mean it's hard with two now we uh my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon but if i had a third one	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i just don't know where it would come from	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
because i work now i work full time and uh you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
right	1
and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i mean absolutely outrageous and they're getting worse	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
uh my daughter brought home a book the other day	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and this book is a little bitty skinny book i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh but it is it's getting worse and	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
right but i think i would have had to work if i'd of had that many i'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
but i think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then you go to work and you work because	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
if you have two or three kids by the way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work and it's just going to be an accepted thing there isn't going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time and um well i work all week and um i can't imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job you know and then when everything's set up then you look for	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school the thing uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
i mean that's just the way it was you know and uh that's like when my mo[m] i know when my mother's age it was	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
uh-huh	1
right	0
yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school and uh i didn't have kids for four and a half years	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
but that was because i wanted to work and i wasn't ready for kids and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her you know	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you don't just get ready	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and uh kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have it i don't care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
and uh even though i'd like to have grandchildren i can see her point	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
uh-huh	1
um	0
yeah	1
yeah and it really is i know it just like now you know there's	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
there's so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff but the rest of it we just buy things like	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
boats or we go on trips or you know just	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
the more or less like entertainment stuff but	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah i feel like i have you know because well we're to the age now i'm not old but i'm older	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
and uh i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it i really couldn't i don't think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
to me it feels like i must have done nothing and i think it's just the new way that people are thinking	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
but uh	1 0
well you know more and more of them are i don't know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals they're getting day care but the reason they had to do this was because so many people	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
all your salary to pay for those two kids to go so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i don['t]	0 0
oh really um	0 1 0
well uh the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so um	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
i i think a lot of it has to do with women working	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
ye[ah] yeah	0 1
right right	1 0
and it and it seems if you're going to have kids uh that you are	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
you know society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and uh because if you have you know two well if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care two or three you know um	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
oh that is good	1 0 1 0
yeah steve's steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in uh march and she doesn't have to work either i don't know how they do it	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
i don['t] i don't know how people do it with one you know um obviously	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
yeah obviously we don't have any and and i don't i think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and not have kids and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to se[t] have have your family and i don't think it's been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
you know and	0 0 0
right	1
oh	1
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah	1
oh yeah i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
stuff	1
oh i know i know	0 0 1 0 0
jeez	0
yeah	0
yeah	1
but that's that's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if i'd of had four i guess it's always not not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah and and that's all right with me because i don't want to stay home you know i think i'm just part of tha[t] the new stuff that is just	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
i don't know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	0
right	1
that's you did that's what you did	1 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh	1
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
i uh i i like the way it is it's uh being see we're from houston and so it's not so hard	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
for people you know you've been married three or so years and you don't have kids well it's okay no[t] nobody does but you come to a place like belton	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and th[ere] a lot of the kids here get married out of high school it's real small town	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
and it's and a lot of people in our su[nday] we're the only couple in our sunday school class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they can't have children who don't have children and they can't imagine why we would want to have children and i'm going well you know	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
there's more to life you know there's life in there that's you know not everybody has to have kids and i'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here it's your turn you know	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah i think that's what it is i'm not either	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
they're probably going oh i bet she can't get pregnant	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
uh-huh right	0 1
yeah	0
yeah steve's mom finally uh	1 1 1 0 0
finally s[aid] you know said that that god will take care of us when it's our time	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
she finally admitted you know she finally told me it's okay if you don't but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and she stayed home and raised her kids and and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives and to be the the housewife and have dinner ready by five and and you know be there at every beck and call and	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
i was raised totally opposite how we got together i don't know but because my mother had six girls	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and you know she worked too and i guess i just	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
and i saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough it was hard you know	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
right	1
yeah i think you've you've earned that though	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
yeah	0
right	0
yeah i think so i think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
are they	1 0
right	1
yeah i don't know if the ti in dallas does or not i know i know nobody around here does it we're it's too small around here yeah	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
anyway what are your what are your first comments on that	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
subject	1
what would you start cutting f[irst] what would be the first thing you'd cut	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
defense	1
mean private enterprise	0 1 1
have private enter[prise] enterprise do it	1 1 1 1 1 0
uh-huh they're already talking about it i mean they're talking about um	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
having it uh as a	1 0 0 1 0
you know business	1 0 1
uh to	0 1
uh you know to so the you know the government doesn't have to deal with it	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
but uh yeah because i think it's all funded either state or federally funded so or uh obvious[ly] so	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
but um	1 0
but see they're	0 1 1
they don't have enough um	0 1 0 1 0
um	0
you know there's there's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they think they need to	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
maybe have uh you know private you know business	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
private enterprise come in so	0 1 1 0 1
um-hum	1
um-hum	1
yeah	1
um-hum	1
yeah its tough to to say what um	1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
you know what uh as far as this that good or bad or what but uh i was just talking to somebody else and	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
all those european countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0
they so uh	1 1 0
no yeah i know what you are saying but i'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
it you know it's just up to high school	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
hum-um	1
um-hum	1
yeah	1
i think the pro[gram] you know that's one reason uh	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
they're not willing to you know to put that you know	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
the training for only a certain amount so	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
um it's you know	1 1 1 0
as far as the technical side	0 0 1 0 1 1
but uh	1 0
even like one one of the biggest things now is like	1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
paralegals and stuff i mean they they're trying to get more people into that field but they can't just bring somebody in	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work	1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
you know for a lawyer as a paralegal	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum well yeah i i'm well ye[ah] i you know i'm assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in	1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously there's uh uh you know there's a lot to learn	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh after that but	0 0 1 1
but uh that's true i'm i'm sure there's a lot of um	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh let me change my channel i've got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up	1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
is that better	0 1 1
okay	1
an[d]	1
yeah it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something so we had some interference so i changed that	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
anyway so um	1 1 0
but uh you know i think uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
you know stuff like that programs like that you know i don't know you know what kind of options they've got	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
um-hum	1
yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
it was either sixty percent or forty percent	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
go to college	1 0 1
and then out of that percentage only so many	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
can get their degree	0 1 0 1
so i thought that was interesting	0 0 0 1 0 1
but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah well i ju[st] you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area and	1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
yeah so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
and they go to college etcetera	1 0 1 0 1 1
yeah	1
well as as far as the you know the deficit that's a whole nother	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries	1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and that we have more money or goo[ds] you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know and um	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
but um	1 0
it's just that uh	0 1 1 0
they're in	1 1
i think you're you're going to find that just because the united states you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
uh the mon[ey] you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
sell products abroad as much as we bring in so	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
hum-um	1
uh my first comments on the budget	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
i would say there has	0 1 1 0 1
surprisingly no	1 1
i would i would cut the prison systems and let them self-support	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
hm	1
you mean the prisons	0 1 0 1
i hadn't heard that	1 0 1 1
right	1
but to me	1 0 1
well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like um the prisoners make	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
rather than sitting there it's the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the united states i feel the same way	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
so it's self defen[se] you know self-defense on that point	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
um	0
as far as my defense	0 1 0 0 1
budget	1
uh they're cutting it back now what twenty five percent i wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
but again i'd like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so i'm lost on that one	1 1 1 0 1 0
i would like to be a little more	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
and to come up with something a little better than what we've got	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
well not so much pay i'm not trying to see the government put out any more	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah but see we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
you know why not an apprentice out to a	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1
you know just a technician	1 0 0 0 1
you can learn on the job	0 0 1 0 0 1
which of course again which m[ean] would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
but that would come down	0 0 1 0 1
excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
yes wow	1 1
yeah it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
we[ll]	1
um-hum	1
well that's something about what germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school they're they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
because they don't have any education i don't mean college and i'm for college but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned they've had it	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	1
oh yeah but	1 1 1
there's a lot of them out there that haven't	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
so that's	0 1
well it seems to me that kids that a[re] get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more they'll make a lo[t] happier life for themselves	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldn't even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
the output from the united states was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
i'll let you go first	0 0 0 0 1
yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah i know what you mean um i in maryland they they do have capital punishment	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
and uh i've seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1
yeah what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years and uh here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
uh just	0 0
yeah but i mean in here it's uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
in order to put more people in into the jails and it was just uh amazing	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
to me and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
being rearrested and	0 1 0
uh	0
i can't remember refresh my memory	0 0 0 0 0 0
um i don't remember myself	0 0 1 0 1
um	1
i think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh that i think it might make a difference right now i don't see it making a difference i don't see someone not going out there	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death i mean most people out there committing murders like don't care	1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
they just don't care	0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah yeah and there's uh there's a lot of people here in baltimore that uh have and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust and	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
of course you know they're they're playing it up real big that it was uh looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
but i mean uh baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
so far this year i think they've got over a hundred dead already this year	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
well it's kind of it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh there's i think x number of people out there that are going to commit murders	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and uh once you kill off a few of them i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah you know it makes sense	0 0 1 0 1 1
um you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
uh so few and far between uh you know makes good tv movies and that's about it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah i had my uh my father-in-law participated in a uh a jury trial he was he was actually on the jury	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
um point blank in the face of course he didn't die and uh this was during a holdup of a uh uh a restaurant and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
and uh you know jumbo cookies and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know it's	0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah and get even with who i mean you know stupid guys	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
and of course you know they tried to make the cop look ou[t] like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
i mean it was amazing	0 0 0 0 0
oh he was found guilty yeah he uh um	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
last i heard he uh	1 0 1 1 0
he beat a push for the death penalty now whether they finally got it or not i don't know i kind of uh	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
stopped listening after a while	1 1 0 0 1
um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to dec[ide] you know after	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
he had to go	0 0 0 0
right	0
and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
within an hour	0 0 1
decided the man's fate	1 0 1 1
yeah	0
hm	0
yeah well it it it went pretty pretty quick from what he said	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
but i mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder i think uh now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh it there's uh a death penalty associated with it	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah yeah i agree	0 0 0 0
yeah i agree i i've i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh that kind of person	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh as far as uh you know there are some some other crimes that i think uh you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
kidnapping um you know when they	0 0 0 0 0 0
i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
uh	0
fine and penalty associated with it but	1 0 1 1 0 0 1
um some of these people are just out and out brutal i some of the cases i've heard about over the years	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh well what's there to say doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
seems like it takes so long between	0 1 0 1 1 1 1
conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
uh-huh well from what i underst[and] i saw a statistic just a few days ago um	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
so far this ye[ar] year or was it during the last year somewh[ere] during a years time i think it was they executed twenty five people in the nation meanwhile there were twenty five hundred people on death row	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
so i i and it's building up you know they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
uh-huh	0
yeah everybody's got that	0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
isn't isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
in the politica[l] in the presidential race	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh may it may not have been maryland it may have been massachusetts i don't remember	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
anyway well the question is you know do you think i[t] it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
if it	0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
well i think in large measure the reason they don't care it's not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
the police don't catch them or the courts don't convict them or or they don't serve very much of the time and so uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
you know their their success rate is very high crime does pay ca[sh] you can make a good living at it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
yeah	0
last year it was dc i guess baltimore caught them	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh i think	0 0 1
i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
i mean i i personally think life imprisonment	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don't think much of li[fe] of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
why bother just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty	0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
so	0
yeah and and also um	0 0 0 1 0
the	0
the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and and base	0 0 1
the ver[dict] sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
just started shooting people	0 0 1 0
because they botched the first job and	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
so now they're going to get even	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
so what was the verdict what was the results there	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
oh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
the the penalty phase yeah they've decide the penalty separately from the verdict	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah well you know you just have to decide you know wha[t] you well yeah there's really two separate decisions there i guess one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and that w[ill] i i've never been on a jury i've never had that experience i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence i mean ye[ah] i can handle people people selling drugs you know it's it's wrong but	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
it it's not worth somebody getting executed for but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and so i go le[t's] you know these are the kind of people i would like to ye[ah] get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
well uh i think she's mostly german shepherd uh she was uh uh	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
a person lives across the street from me	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep somebody somebody abandoned her and she's only about oh si[x] between six and eight six to eight weeks old	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh uh i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though she's al[most] i mean she's that this young and she's almost housebroken	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
i mean she actually asks to go out	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
and uh yeah i was	1 0 1 1 0
amazed	1
really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality i don't know i can't imagine what uh	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
would have been wrong with this dog so	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
oh really	0 1
uh-huh	1
oh yeah	1 1
i had a uh last year i had ano[ther] i had another german shepherd now this one was purebred and uh	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
was just about on death's door but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics and	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
he actually got over it with huh seven hundred dollars in vet bills	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
um but he had actually was able to get him over that and then	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a cadillac	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so i couldn't believe it that was that was really hard but	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and	1
that was even harder though for i was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street so they just felt absolutely awful	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
and i felt felt probably worse for them than than for me because oh gosh they the uh	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog pro[bably] she i think she loved that dog more than i did and uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
she was jus[t] really attached to it but uh it's it's unfortunate but now i've got another one so	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
um see he it it was just over a year uh it was in march of last year	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
so um yeah it'd been didn't didn't have one for a whole year	1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
right	1
my dad's like that he uh he had a beagle that he loved and uh when that beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog there's no way no how and then uh the	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
he the beagle died in i guess about october and by christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh or i humane society and got uh got another one a stray and	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
she she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
mom went an[d]	1 0 0

this friend of mine has th[e] well it's the same guy that was watching uh my german shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on friday	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and took he's got a full a pure bred golden retriever	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing and this they just they had a ball romping around and you know you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and uh this golden retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
well no actually he had no trouble at all he first jumped in and i he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really i don't think he'd swum before	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
but he jumped in in the the river	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
the fast moving water because_1 if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
and up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
this dog dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon he loved it	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
cocoa didn't think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and uh made me pull her back out	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad and	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
so but she got over it	1 0 1 0 0 0

and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step she'd just get on the first step and lay down	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1

have you seen uh canine	0 1 1 0 1
the movie oh you've got to see it especially since you have a german it is so cute	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
yeah and uh an part of the the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's it's just hysterical	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	1
yeah well that's how cleo w[as] you know she'd lay on her step	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
but that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
but you really need to see that movie i i w[e] we bought the movie and i don['t] i don't know how many times i've seen it and it came on tv the other night and i was watching it again and my husband heard me laughing and he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
it is great	1 1 1
yeah	1
well we always wait until we can rent them you know	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh really	1 1
oh	1
uh-huh	1
oh yeah	1 1
there's just	1 1
right	1
that's it	1 1
really	1
not critical at all yeah they're really wonderful	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
all right	0 1
um	0
that's a good question um	1 0 0 1 0
uh i had a job i had to go get a blood test for	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um and they and they did a full blood screen	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
on me but they didn't call that a drug test so tha[t] i think they checked for drugs they just don't tell you they did	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
well i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
well uh uh i i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and i've done employee assistant work and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i i know the the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
that are specifically drug and alcohol related and it's like in the billions of dollars every year	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
um and th[e] the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it but c[ould] you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
so	0
you know there	1 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
true	1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah well and it's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
if somebody else is impaired because generally you know it um you find out one way or another	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
if somebody's got a problem on the job	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and if e[ven] even if like you say even if it's just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers then it it's still a problem	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
so	0
well yeah i guess it comes with the turf	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah and then you're	1 0 0 0
i[n] i[n] in terms of	0 0 0 1 0
drugs they're illegal so you're	1 0 1 0 0
you're breaking the law anyway	0 1 0 0 1
um probably the the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and that's probably the biggest problem there is	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
well i guess that's one of the positive things that ha[s] has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
they will give you an opp[ortunity] o[pportunity] opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and i th[ink]	0 1 0
yeah and i think the benef[its] the company benefits in the long run	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
what what kind of testing do they do when you went	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
urine screen yeah	0 1 1
uh-huh	0
well that happens	0 1 1
it happens a lot	0 0 0 1
there there are people that kn[ow] pay other people for that	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
to help them out	0 1 0 0
yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah it depends r[eally] r[eally] really on how how strong a test it is they've got different degrees as far as as how far back they can check	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests they've they've got some companies that are doing um hair tests	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
yeah well that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
um	0
back a certain period of time	1 0 0 0 0 1
um because um some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
hair follicles i guess are just dead protein and they	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
and it it's apparently al[most] almost like a a calendar they they've got it	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
pretty precise now that they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and and that type of thing	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
so	0
yeah	0
so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
well i did too	1 1 0 1
uh-huh bye bye	0 1 0
have you ever been drug tested	1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
i had i've had uh two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh different jobs i had one at ti and then one at another engineering company and	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
really i mean i don't mind them i don't do drugs anyway i guess if i did maybe i would but	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um i don't know i know a girl that she's a nurse and they get drug tested randomly i've never been randomly drug tested	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah i guess so	1 0 1 0
i guess so	0 1 1
do you think that it's right	0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
right	0
right	0
that's true	0 1
right	0
that's true	0 1
i believe it's right especially for certain jobs	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that i think they should be randomly drug tested i believe full force in that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
i don't know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know secretaries aren't aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
i don't know i i'm kind of biased too because i don't do drugs and so i really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me because i have nothing to worry about	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
so i guess that's kind of biased	0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah it does	1 0 1
yeah that's true	1 1 0
yeah	0
that's true	0 1
but what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before and you know it's it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything and they happen to be tested monday morning	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and they could be fired for that	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
you know that that's kind of unfair also	0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
that's true	1 0
that's true	0 1
that's true	0 1
yeah i think so more than drugs	0 1 0 1 1 0 1
and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
they would pay for an alcohol but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
that's true	1 0
i think that's fair	1 0 0 1
yeah	0
that's true	1 0
that's about all i have to say on it	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh it's a urine test and they uh	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
it was really very official you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours and	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and you have to fill the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's i guess or something	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah i know i ca[n't] it's hard to believe but i guess it does	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i know i'm amazed at the things people will do	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
it is amazing i guess there are people that do that and they are those are expensive tests i'm glad i never had to pay for one	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah i guess so	1 0 0 1
oh really	0 1
how weird i didn't know that	1 1 0 1 0 1
oh that's weird	0 0 1
yeah	1
that's wild	1 1
it's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah that's true	0 1 1
that's true i'm glad i never had to do that by giving blood i can't stand the thought of giving blood	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
i can't even do it for wadley even though it's a good cause	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i enjoyed talking to you	0 0 1 1 0 0
thank you	1 0
bye bye	1 0
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i guess i get my money's worth for	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
i'm not sure though whether i feel	0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas i[sn't] isn't correct	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i i lately i guess um uh or at least for the last t[wenty] twenty years or so i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh there's been and extraordinary amount of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
money spent there and i'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh regardless of the outcome of the desert storm uh desert shield uh situations	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi[litary] military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
as a given in any military operation and	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah and i gue[ss] i i should imagine that that that what the what the problem why i i'm i'm a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and easy i don't know i shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh mideast uh uh over the uh iraqis uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe i'm i i don't know what other foe that would be but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh i i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah but it it it it would that be uh well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh i i should imagine that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated w[as] was when	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
the soviet threat i guess was perceived as being	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
a greater one i don't think there's very much of a threat there today	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and who's controlling them but	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
i i don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh that would be irrational	0 0 0 0 1
right	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
w[hat] what is the name of that	0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yes yes	0 0
yeah well i i i'm what i'm uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
that that was an area that i i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i don't know it just seems to me that over the years now the and and it's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
it's a cliche i i but i see it myself i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
i i i don't know uh i kn[ow] i'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas so i don't totally agree with the the great	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh uh with the with the great ex[penditure] expenditure of effort and time there but i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
and uh rural school systems are like i i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
that they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system or is it all funded out of local taxes	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
sounds like the way the federal and state system works now yeah	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh do you mean a a complete reversal	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
because i guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
yes i see what you're saying uh i uh i i do i i guess i am a s[trong] uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
for any forms of education i mean by that i mean	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
i'm a product myself i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the gi bill	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
what but uh when i look at it to me uh it doesn't really make any difference it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldn't have done	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
i don't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
uh easement made possible	0 1 0 1
and i i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
whether you're a veteran or whether you i don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
that that	0 0
the subsidy itself or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
would give many people who i i think i i think i perceive the fact at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh out of their uh budget i know in the state of florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
in the uh state land grant colleges which which isn't i mean to me it doesn't sound like a lot of money but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year they went from eleven to fifteen hundred	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent i don't know what that would be	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
but that uh i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
that the program now is a uh program now is uh fees that that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states and the states now establish uh don't have enough money so they	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
they must charge fees uh i i i'm not too sure of that reasoning	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes i	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
i i travel extensively in europe and see enormous uh people p[ay] pay uh a great deal	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
in taxes they tell me when i sit and talk to people there they tell me they	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
they some states they pay uh in germany or in	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
in england in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
but but i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
and these myriad of uh now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels i'm not sure that i'm not up fairly close to that	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
you really think so	0 0 0 0
but i mean w[hat] what's what's happened here is is is i feel that that in the last ten years	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
uh my taxes have gone up they haven't gone down i pay uh quite a bit more taxes and and and	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
but that's been a republican government for the last ten years	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
well i	0 0
yeah	0
okay uh i guess i just push something here push one again right	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
just hang up	0 0 0
okay don good talking with you	0 0 0 0 0 0
bye-bye	0
okay	0
well i'm sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
because_1 everybody has a different idea of where the money should go	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
oh yeah no argument here	0 0 0 0 0
yeah well of course uh a lot of uh a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the and the inventory's going to have to be restocked	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh on now i work for ti and one of the things we were told is	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
like they had eleven thousand harm missiles which ti is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in in the war	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
that that's true that's true	0 0 0 0 0
well of of course now we used up twenty per cents per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and uh uh uh ti also makes the missile which was the the tv laser guided bombs	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
and and a big percentage of that was expended as well that that w[as] that was just a matter of	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh it's called paveway	0 0 0 0
and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
so tho[se] those are two	0 1 1 0 1
areas in which ti stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh no doubt	0 0 0
yeah as a matter of fact in texas um	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
by the a state judge	0 1 0 1 1
and they and uh the legislature just passed what they called a robin hood bill	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
which basically what it does	1 0 0 0 0
is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that are that are you know come from local taxes	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh well	0 0
okay to g[ive] to give you some perspective this this town that i had lived in for sometime	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
then we had a number of education reforms	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
so	0
really so	0 0
so what ended up happening was was a was a shift we went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
and uh	0 0
i mean	0 0
oh complete	0 0
complete it's all shifted to local districts	0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
that's right and and i have i have no problem	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
with uh a certain	1 0 0 1
uh floor level minimum level that's a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh but i am opposed to	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so did i my master's anyway	0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
that's right	0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah they had to they had to raise uh community college taxes here	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
a few years ago too	0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
oh oh i can believe that	1 0 0 1 0 1
yep	0
yeah	0
well i guarantee you you'd be paying a lot more in taxes i[f] if uh the democrats had	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
more say	0 1
yeah i really do	0 0 0 0
yeah	0
every everybody is	0 0 0
well what what what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to keep it to keep it b[ecoming] from becoming even more obnoxious	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well this has been really interesting and i've enjoyed our talk	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
no you just uh we just say say good-bye and that's it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
nice talking with you too	0 0 0 0 0
bye-bye	0
okay	0
uh as far as you know crime in the cities i'm sure i[t] like in yours it's pretty pretty bad	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how about_1 you	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
um-hum	0
proba[bly] probably right if you look at it from that stand point	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
what uh is there anything that uh that you particularly are concerned with in in your particular area	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
as far as security and that sort of thing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum do you live in a real small town or or out in the country	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
how far out from the city i mean do you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
about_1 fifteen miles i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
but it's pretty congested we are considered in the country but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country our major crimes in our immediate	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
town uh is probably robberies house robberies	1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and very few instances of you know alcohol drug uh reported however i'm sure they're there	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
and since that time everybody's gotten some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices the sensors and things like that it's cut back	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
you know considerably but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
uh i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
most well most families most families they are young and both people are working so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work uh so uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
i would say that's probably their prime motivation they'll s[talk] they'll stalk your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um they classify most of them_1 as professionals uh you get a few of them_1 that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for uh jewelry	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
are the major targets guns that sort of stuff	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
very few you know penny penny ante stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well uh the police force for one i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use uh it's oh right now i think uh we're about	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many and	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh but for the that would be certainly be a deterrent	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh not necessarily you know uh give in to their uh human rights desires you know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them_1 in there till they just suffocate uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
especially you you know in the case of murder uh i know in my case i ha[d] my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five and we caught the individuals got caught we uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh you know the the guy only got five years and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system so what what	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
do what now	0 0 0
n[o] no i'm not real familiar with that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh	0
well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him and they said well you know he they're he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that that you could go after	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah uh very seldom	0 0 0 0
yeah they don't do that here course they pay them but they don't you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and uh you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after them_1 because they're you know they're they're repeat offenders they uh they've been in jail before they've been released you know several times which is another	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh deal i hate to see but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and uh and car theft on top of it and destroys my car he we're out you know uh you know	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
fifteen thousand dollars and you know the guy gets out in two months and he goes out and commits it again fact he's back in jail now so what what uh	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
yeah what what deterrent does he really have	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility uh we've had a couple instances where break-ins where the the people have actually you know	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
shot the people and uh return offenders have	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
they've actually waited for them_1 where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else and try to take it in their own hands course it doesn't always work out in their favor	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us you can you know you can get some of us you can't get all of us	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah that's i mean that's certainly a a possibility an[d] an[d] we have had a a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh it helps for a while but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh i would say probably eighty percent of them_1 that are caught they're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas you know across the the border	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so you know people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever it's not many from the local communities but uh	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
it's a problem and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties would be a definite deterrent and	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
right	0
um-hum	0
i know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal they they went to all all	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	0
uh well i don't actually live in the city but uh i'd probably say that's roughly right i mean	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but i i think with the current war on drugs	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution um and sale of drugs	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
um-hum	0
uh where i live no it's it's not so bad i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it um	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
but i do have friends who live in the city and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
um just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
i live out in the country yeah	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
i am about fifteen miles out	0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
hm	0
hm	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
wow	0
that's huge	0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
are they are there any theories on why this is happening	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum but why why is it happening	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
so they're professionals	0 0 0
hm	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
hm	0
well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right but that mean that's gonna tend to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
right they're doing that in our state t[oo]	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
so you think that would be a deterrent	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
right so you'd you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
hm	0
right	0
oh wow	0 0
oh my goodness	0 0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right	0
wow	0
did you did you sue him under the civil system	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
did you sue him under the civil system	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
well you probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him and	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah makes you wish they had uh still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
but they g[ive] give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah that's too bad	0 0 0 0
um-hum um-hum	0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah i i think that's a yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
that's awful	0 0
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes just	1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
oh my god	0 0 0
hm	0
right	0
right	0
um-hum	0
i mean that sounds that's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake hear you break in and you're gonna get shot	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
hm	0
wow	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
i mean i i tend to agree with you i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes um there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is um	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
if someone is found guilty of a uh felony level offense they lose their citizenship and they lose their constitutional rights	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just don't protect them_1	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
i know and i think i think that's ridicul[ous]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay do you vote regular	0 0 0 0 0
every one	0 0
well see that's me i've never paid any attention to voting	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1

have enough knowledge on it to even you know to pick the right person	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so that's what they need well	0 1 0 0 1 1
it uh they said something to improve voting	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
if they could	0 0 0
make it more oh easier to find out you know what's going on do you know what i mean	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
like uh	0 0
like to me i don't i didn't know what would have been wrong with i can't even remember who ran for president against bush i think it was uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
that woman wasn't it a woman	0 1 0 0 0 0
dukakis	0

there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while ferraro	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
okay	0
well well that's what i mean like i didn't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
you know i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
okay i don't remember anything about dukakis	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
but	1
well they're all saying that they're going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
that's what i mean if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i don't know like you know in school they didn't teach you about demo[crats] uh the government not really	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
hum-um	0
yeah	0
well i'm not sure they're yeah i know how they do it it like i[t] with the abortion issues and stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
right	0
right	0
right and like i said most of the poli[ticians] the politicians i'm the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also the politicians put out what makes them_1 look good anyway	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and everybody's got you know stuff they don't want known	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
well anyway i'm sorry i didn't i didn't have	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
much knowledge i don't even remember this being on there	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
incentive	0
you i guess that would be good now i'm sure they've got it at the library	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
you know	1 0
i mean if i get to the library i've got two babies so i don't	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
but i	0 0
i don't know	0 0 0
oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
um	0
well a lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes you know if since you're what democrat	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
th[en] then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote democrat right	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i mean	0 0
no	0
all split	0 0
right	0
i lie	0 0
hm	0
i don't know if i did understand politics i probably would vote more but like i said if i voted for bush or like when uh gary	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
hart was running	1 0 1
a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking not that i think he was good looking but	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
he was young	0 0 0
and then	0 1
i didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
but because it was he had an affair	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and it just threw him out of the whole running	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
and a lot of people go by their uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
personal life when they vote	1 0 0 0 1
and	0
which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work but	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
i'm sure there's a lot of people that have had	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
well criminal or something like that's different but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if him and his wife weren't getting along i mean	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
what is what effect does that have on him running for president	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
do you know what i mean	0 0 0 0 0 1
it's all so secretive see we really don't see the	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
true person anyway	1 1 0
right	0
right	0
uh-huh well what did you think of reagan as a president	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
do you think he won from carter because of the um	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
the hostages that were held at that time	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
i thought carter was good too and that was yeah	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
but i think i wasn't well let's see that's been about ten years ago right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
okay so i was only fifteen or sixteen but i remember carter and i liked him yeah	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
no i sure don't	0 0 0 0
yeah i do i try and vote in every single election	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
but uh that's just since in the past say about six years before that i really didn't pay any attention at all	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh you haven't	0 0 0
yeah	0
i didn't use to but now i really because_1 i get so angry about what goes on and then i feel like i can't really complain too much unless	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
but the problem is that i am very liberal politically and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
liberal politically i'm you know like pretty left wing demo[crat] democrat so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh you don't	0 0 0
okay well there's a lot of them_1 um [de]pends on what issue you're talking about but democrats are on a lot of issues are more liberal than republicans and	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well it used to be it's kind of hard to say now especially after desert storm but um i think back in the eigh[ties] times when uh my political opinions were being formed like in viet[nam] during the vietnam war and stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
the republicans were more	0 1 1 1
you know what they called hawks which is more like aggressive in war and more pro-war and pro-aggression and um	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
the democrats were the doves they were more for peace and i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore i think you know the issues are	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah and democrats usually are su[pportive] more supportive of public assistance programs and and programs to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um	0
th[e] the big republican thing is that they don't they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society and so they're more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people or more	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
m[ore] uh they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
running things	0 1
so so have you ever voted at all	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
you haven't	0 0
how old are you	0 0 0 0
oh gosh	0 0
well	0
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
yep	0
yeah well	0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah yeah	0 0
du[kakis]	0
no it was dukakis	0 0 0 1
from massachusetts	0 1
oh yeah that was yeah ferraro that was a while ago that was a couple elections ago yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah that's okay	0 0 0
um-hum	0
so what do you think about	0 0 0 0 1 1
uh what do you think about what you see on tv about them_1 like in the news or on the ads do you kind of just	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
you don't	0 0
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
um-hum	0
right	0
you didn't get any government classes	0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah it's really hard too because before they used to have um	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
a lot of	0 1 0
it seems like the stuff that they put out now it i mean i doesn't just seem like it i know for a fact that the any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material well what do you believe in what do you believe in they don't take any stands on anything they kind of say well what do you want me to believe	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum yeah they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
things like that so that's kind of how i judge there's a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control or let me see i try to look at	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
what if some of the newspaper articles or the i don't trust tv as much but newspaper articles can show wheth[er] how they voted in the past	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and but you get you know it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum yeah yeah	0 0 0
right everybody's got a secret	0 1 0 0 1
so	0
well that's okay	0 0 0
do you think	0 0 0
do you think um i mean what would it take like that this is really good actually tha[t] for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted i mean what kind of	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
how would it how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that that you would know more about it like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library or	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
oh do you yeah that'll tie you down a little bit	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
or do you just not do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote or	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
um-hum well not in my family we're kind of really independent	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
but a lot of families do that i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved golly	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
but	0
well	0
um-hum	0
hart	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
um-hum yeah	0 0
um-hum	0
i think everybody does it just depends on how well you can hide it	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know and i that's very true i i think that doesn't really have that much to do with um unless they've done something really horrible you know or something real abnormal	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah right but otherwise	0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
yeah yeah	0 0
that's right	0 0
i think that's that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country's being run is that um the the election	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that you know that really don't have anything to do with how well they do the job but see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no and if they don't say yes or no then	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
maybe somebody'll vote for them_1 that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side do you know what i'm saying so they just try and make it a personal thing i mean if you remember	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
any of the tv commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had uh pictures of bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
even from reagan it was all just like looks like a mcdonald's commercial you know	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
that's about what it looked like	1 0 0 0 1 0
i just thought he was really inept i don't think he did anything at all he they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
well i think that was part of it i think there's a lot of the the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff people just had a picture of carter as not being real capable	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
but he actually all right this	0 0 0 0 0 0
i thought he was great	0 0 0 0 0
did you i always liked him i thought he was great at the time and i i just couldn't get over the fact that reagan beat him i you know that i just couldn't believe that he got voted out	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1

you know what it seems like we are doing it here forever we bought a a large house that was completely unlandscaped i mean it it was pro[bably] probably was	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
up to your shoulder in in thistles that was all that was there and we hired a professional landscaper to do it	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and i have since then probably ripped out	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time and	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
probably through the fall too	1 1 0 1 1
and uh	1 1
rip up rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires uh more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
just two	0 0

four and five	0 0 0
um-hum	0
oh well i have a twenty six year old stepson and i don't know if that counts	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i did for many years so yeah	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
yeah it is over with	0 0 0 0 0

well you should of just ripped the whole thing out	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
have you had is this the first year they have been up	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
well let me tell you they do not come back very well at all maybe they will if up further north but down	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
and you are not that much further north i have probably planted oh around here	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
um maybe six hundred bulbs	1 0 1 1 1
no i have probably have done hyacinths but i have just learned wi[th] with doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
because_1 they do not take the heat here and if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yep	0
about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area is the uh uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1

and you only get one of them	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
you know what i bet you they are	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and i am a pretty i am a pretty good gardener because_1 i have killed a lot of things here and and planted a lot of them and i i work on a uh landscape committee for our neighborhood	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
our neighborhood is a planned development with	0 1 0 0 1 1 0
i think it's seven hundred fifty five families	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
but we have about sixteen acres that we have to plant	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i am going to bet you that is a lily because if it is	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
and i will get uh	0 0 0 0 0
is it uh what color is is yours blooming	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1

i am going to bet you that that has got to be blooming this time of year it's	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
well i was just going to correct myself because they would have bloomed pretty early	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
well	0
yeah right about after the daffodils	0 0 0 0 0 0
okay i will bet you those are dutch iris	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	0

well	0
ooh	0

huh	0
well i am not so sure that texans really know what they've what they have got	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
did you just move down here	0 0 1 0 1 0
ooh who who who because_1 i have got a flower i have got i have probably got do do do do	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
h[e] h[e] i don't know how many square feet it is a big circular driveway the whole uh perimeter bordering the house is all in texas wildflower beds and	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
i am into that and it and it looks quite formal i mean it really does it looks quite formal but it has been about three or four years of uh uh playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you want blue	0 0 0
um-hum	0
ooh blue is hard you know if you want do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all summer	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
okay put in a perennial blue salvia	0 1 1 0 1 1 1
now it's going to grow about um the plant itself will grow about	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
eighteen inches tall and it'll send out a flower spike you will see them blooming now it is a wildflower here but you can get them in the nursery	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yep well the you know nursery men will se[ll] will sell you things here and they are they are kind of in a labor of love the other thing to do if you re[ally] really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
yep	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
i will tell you another plant that is purply i[t] i[t] it is dark purply kind of a purply blue red it is really a pretty plant	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
it is sold down here as purple buddy now it's not yeah it is not a perennial it is an annual but it will take the heat down here	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
purple buddy it's proper name is gomphrena	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
g o m p h r e n a gomphrena	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and sold as purple buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower and they make uh oh about a foot high plant and they send out this this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it but that purple ball	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i've uh	0 0
i've	0
well i've had i used to have the opinion that there wa[s] that there really wasn't any more crime in america in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh before uh simply because the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
the police now had advanced uh reporting methods with computers and other devices	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
that's right and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
however i have been persuaded lately i guess simply by the uh overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
well yeah	0 0
no i am in i am in washington d c	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
actually it you know i do a lot of business here and i come here quite often and and that again is a is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
regardless of the racial makeup but it's it's these real uh there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
right now just to focus on that a minute i guess uh	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
um when um previous secretary of uh	0 0 0 1 1 0 0
educate bennett i think his name was became the drug czar uh for uh uh president bush he was going to focus on it	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
on this area and do something about it and i see that even he was met without with with little success even though the entire	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
i guess a a quite a bit of money and and other uh planning efforts went into that	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
well	0
yes	0
well i uh i have three theories about it you know three things i have one theory and it's by two things one i i believe that this is a function of uh the violence that young people see on television and in the movies	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and i am not just talking about you know uh	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
role models of uh of tough guys and gangsters and things like that i'm i'm not even	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
i'm not even	0 1 1
convinced that maybe things like uh football hockey and the the and and you know the the and even baseball games now where the everything is settled with a fight you know the the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the uh the argument and	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and then i i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree so i think that particularly i i was reading the other day about uh corpus christi texas which has the highest	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
i think it's corp[us] corpus christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in america	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh per capita i mean the saturday night special stuff so that that's what i think about it that's some of the things i think about it plus uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i know what are your views	0 0 0 0 0 0
yes	0
exac[tly] well that's that's that's the impression i get yeah	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and i and i imagine it's it you know it just feeds upon itself when when we have this sort of violence in society people want to it conditions people to it and	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh you have to emph[asize] it has to be even uh magnified to attract people's attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that and i am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh i mean i i read now where where	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
you know women are arr[ested] young women are arrested fighting with knives over over	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
whatever whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when i was young now i do not want to sound like an old fart but but that that's what it seems that those things happened before	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
it didn't happen in that manner before television and i i i i have to think that that it has some influence on it	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
but	0
yeah	0
no	0
oh yes	0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
yes yes well i mean i i guess so what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was uh that	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh there's so mu[ch] there's so much of a return from pris[on] to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure and	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
and that is not emphasized i recognize there's there's over crowding problems and and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that that's complicated the entire process what i also think is that	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i i guess it's the reflection of of the society where where we have so much more mobility and less	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1

uh you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
where you where you live or i do not mean respons[ibility] attachment and responsibility i guess i mean	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
any sort of	0 1 1
yes that's right th[at] yeah	0 0 0 0 0
i i do not know how that's i do not think it's done by uh the changes come simply by statutory nature i do not know what it really will take	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
huh and i do not know if i have solutions except except to you know i am sort of a a an advocate of	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
of uh of letting people of having free speech and i guess to curb	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh television uh the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that however there does seem to be a right now in verbalizing it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
and the sacrifice isn't that great	0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yes yes i think i think that's correct	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well texas has uh texas has uh has always struck me i mean i i i have lived in and out of texas both in the service and	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and uh uh short business stints and it seems to me they are a pretty pretty tough law and order state but but yet that does not seem to have effected the	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
amount of violent right in the state just citing that you know	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
compile more statistics	0 0 0
um-hum	0
more especially where you are you in washington dc or washington state	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah i was going to say	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh yeah	0 0
it just really grabs your attention it just makes the whole place seem like that	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
what do you what do you think is is causing all this because it seems that there there even though crime though though i think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
um-hum	0
hum	0
yeah i i haven't seen that but uh yeah	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
well yeah i tend to agree with you with you know it seems anymore uh a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
some sort of violence or something in it and and along with that you know and then you start making a movie and	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
it it has no there's no call for something violent but so they just throw something in there just to say they have it	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
yeah you become callous	0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
um	0
yeah	0
i listening to a radio talk show today at lunch time uh rush limbaugh i do not know if you listen to him or not he's on am but uh there there's a fellow that had called in and was	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
lamenting about the uh that there was a interview done on the assistant chief of police for los angeles the guy under gates and they were just really coming down on him because of	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
some of the things he was just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals for instance uh they asked him if he spanked his kids and he said you bet i believe in discipline and people i i i i guess they confuse confused discipline with punishment	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
you know and ju[st] it seems anymore that uh if if you have	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know this type of a moral stance	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
that people come down on you it's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing and i disagree and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
well nobody feels responsibility to do something it's like oh boy i wish they would stop doing that yeah	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
hum	0
yeah	0
yeah and then how many	0 0 0 0 0
how how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between you know what you see and how you i mean what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and and yes but you know as soon as you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
start uh	0 0
yeah uh unfortunately you man got a lot of the	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh some well a lot of it can be contributed to the the	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the racial differences i mean just you know we are so close to the border with mexico we've got a lot of that influence	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
it seems to be a a topic that's gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i um wasn't raised as a kid on it but my kids are and so they they tended to wanna	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do and	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out and they weren't worth anything anymore	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and we it took us um	1 1 1 0 0 0
almost a year to get a garbage sack full we just don't drink that many so as far as at home use uh we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
of dr pepper or something and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
uh at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound and we came out with about_1 a dollar	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it just really wasn't worth it yeah so they they realized you know well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old that wasn't uh that was a big deal but	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it and then um	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
ti started keeping up with uh cans there so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them_1 in there	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
least it gets back into the system but um as far as a habit at the house uh	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
have y'all got the individual containers yet	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
hm	0
right yeah it seemed like uh if if i recall it's been a long time they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it they were fine on the green big green containers but uh seems like they said they were just gonna have a bin	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and all s[orts] different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as as needed it it seemed that there was at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
and that at at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
um the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
than having a household try it but i i don't know that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah yeah	1 0
right	1
that's true	0 0
right	0
yeah	0
they don't do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them_1 but	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh they weren't that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day and	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah just a little bit of begging will	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	0
well i wonder if	1 0 0 0
yeah	0
right yep	0 0
where do you take your cans	1 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
and a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying yeah	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
no i read in the paper this week where maybe i don't know if it w[as] was i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them_1 up is outfitted in time	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
but i it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh i'm not sure all what we're gonna have to do whether we have three separate containers i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
oh well	0 0
um-hum	0
well it'd get messy too	1 0 0 1 0
i i i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
and uh which we're not in the habit of doing i was brought up uh you know long time ago that	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
they didn't even have cans they had bottles and you'd return them to the the grocery store and you'd get your money back and that that was all well and good and they don't seem to still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
i guess this day and age they don't	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum yeah and they uh p[eople] i i think kids don't	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care they can get more somewhere else uh for a good many	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
right they're the the nickels the dimes or what i suppose it might be quarter and fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just don't seem to	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
to care that that much about a small amount of money	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
but now we we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety nine cents so i would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before um it was just easier	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
so that's the main reason we're we uh sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
well as you say it takes a while to build it up since we've had the crusher all summer we i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta[ken] oh i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them_1 to a	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a recycling place probably at one of the	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
li[braries]	0
the aids issue is	0 1 0 0
is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more peo[ple] mean more people than aids	0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded aids has more money than uh breast cancer	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
it's just one big pr campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to aids	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years and it's just one of those	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and uh having thought about that for a while	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i go[t] i got to thinking	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood an[tigen] antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so it's not really cure f[or] yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
through different organizations march of dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever	1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
how they fund whatever um illness they wish i[t's] it's kind of hard to	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
right	1
right	1
that's true	0 1
you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
a unfair advantage as they were but	0 1 1 0 0 1 0
the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
we have such an affluent [s]ociety society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but that's	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
are they that enhancing for the m[asses] for the masses you know they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and well that's interesting isn't it yeah	1 0 1 0 1 0 0
right	1
what did you think about that idea	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
hm they've not really given it attention either yeah	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
right	1
well i'm i'm glad i'm not the one that's that's in charge of of making those decisions they uh	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because_1 they're all so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden it's the most important thing	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
so i i would hate to have that responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
i uh	1 0
i guess i it it frightens me to think of so many people with with aids and with cancer and	0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
many of those things um if they're not able to to be insured then the country's gonna pay for it one way or the other	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
whether it's through	1 0 0
prevention or or treatment or you know	1 0 1 1 1 1 0
just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so it seems like one way or the other we're gonna end up paying for it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
just change our p[riorities]	1 1 0 0
right just change our priorities a little bit and	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
is uh kind of fun it's best done when you have leisure time and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now and	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
i grew up in an area that uh it was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
a variety of boats at our disposal um i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
got a new canvas sail for it and had a real hu[ge] big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
chambers that keep it afloat or keep it uh upright again this one you had to work with you get out of the water again and get it upright and uh sailing was was kind of nice to	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were attacking back and forth and	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and uh the storm or the wind was due to the s[torm] front blowing in and soon as the front came over	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
it was calm so you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away and that didn't always work we often times got wet but um	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
it's it's a nice nice hobby to have and nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
what are your memories of boating or current	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
right	1
it's true	0 1
yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and it was uh it had a lot of um	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and sn[atched]	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
pushed him away and got out of the water a a while and and uh it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
before they took off this time and and swatted him away so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've i've uh	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
i i know how	0 0 1 0
you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
so life changes a little bit in that respect i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesn't have a uh well what they call trick skis they'll allow you to ski backwards i haven't	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
cra[ft] managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet but uh	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of w[ork]	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
work your way up to it and turn around real quick you know grab the rope behind you and then just l[et] let go real quick and let it whip you around but uh i don't know maybe someday i'll	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
i'll get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end uh weekend or something	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
um about the only memories that i have of boating um my husband's family had a a motor boat um when we got engaged	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
and they took us out on the lake several times and uh i really did enjoy that i i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but um we did some water skiing of course and and uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting um	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
you know they you they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
the laws were there and if you didn't obey them_1 uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
you know there were a lot of accidents i guess but um i found the motor boating was real fun	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
oh	0
that sounds like a real challenge	0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
hm	0
well my son	0 0 1
where is your favorite place to go	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
oh that's great have you ever been there	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh that's a perfect age for disneyworld	1 0 0 1 1 0 1
oh that's great yeah so we've been there a number of times and uh we're going next year we have a business trip every fall well we go on a lot of business trips i	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i don't work well we do we go my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he's in they don't care if i go along	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
so it's great i just kind of join up when it's something interesting and uh disneyworld is the one for a week next year	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
and it'll be at this time of the year and this year we're leaving um uh matter of fact we're leaving next saturday for new orleans	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
have have you ever been there	0 0 0 1 0 1
well you know we went there once in fact we had been in dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to new orleans so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
a project he's going to be and then i said well i'll go along i hope it's swimming season because it wasn't a tremendous thing not amount of things to do that i wanted to do there	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
it well an[d] and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a mardi gras night planned	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and i'm kind of anxious for that but um yours to disneyworld sounds a little bit better	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
did you know that next week there's several tv shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh i[f] so uh well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh that's	1 0
well i really i think travel when i heard my topic today i thought okay that's my favo[rite] that's my favorite becau[se]	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
and really at our point of life our children are grown and um it has just worked out really well with this um	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
position he's in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he's going	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
whether or not i decide to go along but i do do like to travel and it's um i don't mind the pool life at all during the day and i like to sightseeing and i love to shop	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
so it's	0 0
that's right but if thi[s]	1 1 0 0 0
well and one of my very favorite is las vegas um that i would have to say we both end up going to las vegas um probably once every maybe year and a half	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with continental	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental and i said well now that we have all the miles we better start using them	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
uh so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
just kind of a quick trip um when we normally go that way we like to go to california at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from texas	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
i think that's a good trip and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
now we did what we sometimes do since we are in ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
what i would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to colorado to denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through utah	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and as far west as las vegas and then we returned through uh new mexico that you just mentioned and it was oh it was just great	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
oh i i think that's that's the way to	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
well we haven't traveled outside the united states that much um we usually take family type vacations we're looking forward to one in october to disneyworld in florida	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
a have a nine year old when when both of my kids were much younger and this time we're gonna be going with just one daughter and she's nine so it ought to just be a ball	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh i think so too	0 1 0 0 0
oh wonderful so you travel a lot	1 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
sure	1
um-hum	0
oh that'll be fun too yes we went years ago we haven't been lately and i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything but we used to have a lot of fun there	1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping there isn't much there but that can be fun	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
no i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
yes be excited about all of it	1 0 1 0 0 0 0
well not really uh we're doing the same thing tying it in with my husband's business trip and i just save vacation for things like that and uh just travel whenever we can	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
how easy	1 1
right	1
um-hum	0
sure	1
um-hum	0
um-hum so that's perfect what more could you ask for	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and then get to pick and choose the places	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
ah	0
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right it's kind of shaky	1 0 0 0 1
that's true it really is	0 1 0 1 1
um-hum our last big trip we drove through new mexico and colorado and went to the grand canyon and and uh	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
back through silverton and durango and oh it was fun it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it our	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
um-hum	0
right	1

uh-huh	0
so you can't use oil on wood	1 0 1 0 1 0 1
oh so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh	0
oh is that what you usually use in the house is latex	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
hm	0
uh-huh yeah heard about that i guess a friend of mine had a uh um well she she just started up a day care center	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
and uh an[d] the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
so uh she had that done but uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
well um so to speak i had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing uh that you keep some um farm equipment in	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah it was it used all of it i guess it was about three hundred yards worth so well i guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
well what about the trim in your house did you have to do that	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
oh yeah	0 0
did you have uh one coat or two	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
yeah that would be really time a a time saver	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum oh me i would've had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and and then i'd have probably rolled it on i'd uh it would've taken me forever	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
yeah well the first time it'd probably would've tooken me forever so	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
well how long did it take y'all	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
so there was two of y'all	0 0 0 0 0 1
well that's easy enough	0 1 0 1
um	0
i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
yeah this is a great topic for me because_1 i just did my first two painting projects ever it was not not a big deal	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
two little deals the first one um i helped someone repaint an apartment and it was very easy	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
yeah and i've never painted anyth[ing] i always thought it would be so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it and the second one was i bought some toys at a um	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
at a craft fair they're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a a little girl for christmas and so i just decided to paint them and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment was	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
well it's uh it that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't it was a oil base so i had to get and when i painted them_1 i	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
didn't realize that we didn't have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didn't realize you know i had never painted anything so i didn't realize that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
well no you can use it on wood but i just had it all over my hands and i went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands and you can't wash it off with water you have to get the uh a solution	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and	0
yeah i had to drive to the store yeah i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and right back and everything like that and then um	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just use[d] we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah and and it it just like the same with the toys it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it you know it says safe for children and all that	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
have you painted anything recently	0 0 1 0 1
wow was it huge	1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
wow	1
yeah i think though um we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because_1 i don't know if i could you know i don't know i don't know must be difficult	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
no it was j[ust] it was really easy i just like what i we had a couple of different size brushes and it wa[s]	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
you know real easy i went around the trim and if i[t] and there was wallpaper like i was do[ing] just doing just the trim of the around the doors and windows and there was wallpaper and	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
if we got it on the wallpaper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried it came right off so there was no major mistakes there was	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
uh two actually um and it there was um you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
well yeah if you just you know we didn't tape anything we weren't that careful but it wasn't you know i don't know it's it's funny it's like if you just go slow you don't get or at least i didn't get that many	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
mistakes i didn't make that many mistakes	1 0 0 1 0 0 0
why just because you'd be afraid to do it or have you done it be[fore]	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well it wasn't if it was my own i would've but my friend said oh just go ahead you just go ahead it's easy i said okay it's your place	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
well a couple of weekends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends and	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
no there was they were doing all sorts of repairs and there was i was just painting because_1 i don't know how to do anything else so there's a whole bunch of people yeah	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
so now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
but you know i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys and the guy said oh get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
but i didn't realize what you know a pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex i don't know if it's worth the shi[ne]	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
so do you have any recycling programs there	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
oh uh-huh	0 0
yeah	0
we've progressed a little bit farther than that um actually they have uh parts of town	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
it may have even spread all over the whole town and um they have these green bins	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
and it's just as standard as a a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin and you put your bottles in it and paper	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and um you know all those things that aluminum you know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and uh i guess you can al[so] and a lot of the restaurants	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles and uh	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh i don't know i guess they're you know clear bottles so um you know a lot of people do have those separated	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and of course they have the um dumpsters uh the the igloos	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh and they have those strateg[ically] strategically placed around the city	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and uh they're they're actually gonna extend it i think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes and uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah	0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
oh really hm	0 0 0
yeah i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans and uh	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah they're doing a real good job of uh separating it here and of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup um and it's uh i think it started out to be um	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
just kind of a test a pilot project and it went over so well that they just extended it and it's almost uh i don't know if it's done by a private company or not it may be	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
but uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
let's see oh and every year of course the phone books	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
um they tell everybody across the city to um put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
because you know phone books are pretty well for a bigger city they're pretty thick an[d] and sometimes you might have two or three	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
so uh that's that's a big savings right there in itself	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah hm	0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum well the thing about newspapers and paper recycled paper is actually very expensive	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
so when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that it's uh they're not coming out ahead at all	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
it's uh it's really a cost	0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
i mean it it sounds good to the public but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something now aluminum i don't know they may be coming out ahead	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
but i know for a fact that the paper	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh on that end they're not you know it's it's good to recycle but it's uh not to their advantage and it costs less	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i can't think of anything else okay	1 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
well i hope y'all um uh come along a little farther in the future	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
it was nice talking to you bye-bye	0 0 1 1 0 0 1
um i don't really think we have anything	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
in the works as of yet uh we're pretty small town and um the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of wal-mart	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
that show you know plastics	0 1 1 0 1
paper	1
liter bottles et cetera et cetera	1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
oh	0
yeah	0
huh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
oh	0
oh that'd be good	0 1 0 1
yeah see it's not anywhere near that uh we uh you know as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans	1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but that's as far as we go because_1 i take them_1 to a girl at work and she goes and cashes them in because you know i just	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
i can do that for her and and i don't want the hassle because_1 we have to go to another town to do it	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah see we don't have anything here in belton it's it's a pretty small little town	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
so	1
yeah that's about all th[at] that we're doing here uh they're	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh getting a little bit more on	0 1 0 0 0 1 0
they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you can't because	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
you know not a lot of people do really know what you know	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
what it's for	0 0 1
yeah	0
um-hum	0
wow that's excellent that's good	1 1 1 1 1
yeah	0
oh	0
yeah they uh	1 1 0
exactly	1
yeah see ours just goes in the regular trash it just you know there's not a whole lot and there are you know some places that	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
we'll set up you know for old newspapers and stuff but usually it's	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
it it hasn't caught on yet i'm hoping it will soon	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
hm i wasn't totally aware of that	0 0 0 0 1 0 0
so	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
hm	0
well	1
i can't either because_1 we're we're at a very you know beginning stages so	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
we look forward to it to get better but that's it	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah me too	1 0 1
you too bye	0 1 1
okay why don't you start so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1

i'm envious well it's a beautiful day here and it's in the sixties but we still have a lot of hot afternoons it's supposed to be eighty five today	1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1

because_1 you just can't stand the sweaters but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

and even when his job is not gonna be with people all day long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1

and i will uh run around to the store and things in slacks and tennis shoes and she	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
right and pearls and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school so uh she tells me i dress young but that's okay keeps me young	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
well there's not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
so i i guess this is what you call a natural end	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
well we wear uh course um like i said if if my husband's going downtown he's got the whole uh	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
you know the dress men's dress shoes	1 0 0 1 0 1 0
but for as out here just anything that the moms we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and and uh tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah i'm sure they are there yeah i'm sure they are	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
that's right i'm sure that's true it's a lot different than working in a kid's preschool that's right well you all have a nice day there	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
thank you very much bye-bye	1 0 1 1 1
i'm already on my job so you're you reached me at my job	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
my my dress for work uh most of the time is uh rather comfortable and casual	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh usually uh slacks and a soft colored shirt	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
the um thing that that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
and a suit and uh all of that sort of thing but when i don't need to dress up for a a meeting or a service of some sort i don't	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yes	1
well around there you can probably wear uh t-shirts and other things but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and uh coats	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
today today we we wear coats and as the day uh warms up we may go to light jackets but i don't think there's an escape from light jackets	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
the wind will take away a lot of body heat	1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
very similar	1 0
no i'm not stuck with that kind of a uh situation	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
as i say unless it happens to be now yesterday i had to dress up and and um be more formal because i had a a formal meeting at noon time	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
but then i can go home later in the day and and be a little more casual	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and then if i have a a a meeting of people that i know i can be very casual in the evening	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah that's around here in a lot of places that's the way it is i mean there there are ex[pected] expected uh dress codes	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and the people need to follow that i think uh years ago i used to be far more uh committed to the idea of of a dress code but i've	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
relaxed a lot more as i've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
it's taken a long time to break away from from that but now that i've broken away from it i'm i'm glad i have	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
you mean you don't need to wear little old house dresses anymore	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
that's a good idea that's a good idea	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
no they're you [kn]ow wh[at]	1 0 1 0 0
but yeah what kind what kind of shoes do they wear down there	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
we we can wear pretty much that although um tennis shoes are kind of out in in almost every every situation	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
unless you wanna look like a gook	1 0 0 1 0 0 1
a lot different	0 1 1
you too and thank you for calling um-hum bye	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
okay well um	1 1 0
i am i was thinking about it for a long time and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
um i don't have a whole lot of dislikes i um like jazz um especially the blues and uh	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
i like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from bach and and beethoven and chopin and um	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
just in general everything	0 0 1 1
um i enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
still	0
yeah right right	0 1 1
uh well	0 1
that gets some of the punk	1 0 1 0 0 1
um when i was in high school that was uh one of the big things was punk music and uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
a lot of it is has a lot to say or s[ome] some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do but the the actual	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh well it	0 1 0
it's it's it really expresses	0 0 0 1 1
some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
um but as far as a musical art form i just don't see a whole lot of art to it um	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um some of it um it depends i like uh the rap	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
the two types of rap i like or i enjoy to listen to and one is the the rap that is just funny um and they usually do a lot of satire	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um	0
right	1
right the monotonous the monotonous no that's not	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
i don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about well i'm better than you and blah blah blah i don't like that i like the funny satire and then some of it is	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
urban society it it really does it talks about um race relations and police relations and	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
um that that	0 1 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah that's that's about my opinion of that	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
it's it's okay um	0 0 1 0
hm the thing about country western that i don't enjoy is is doesn't seem to be any imagination	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
behind it the one country and western song sounds like	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
every other country and western	0 1 0 0 0
and so the the musicians	1 1 0 0 1
don't get to really get into their music they just play a certain number of chords the drummer plays a certain beat and you have a country and western song	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and	1
hm	0
right	1
yeah and i can't say that i like a lot of the modern the very very modern	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
uh rock and roll but i i definitely i really enjoy	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
rock and roll	1 0 0
and uh	0 0
i really enjoy especially the sixties uh ev[ery]	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
what kind of music do you like	0 0 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
do you like like rock and those kind of things punk even	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
i don't think they have a whole lot to say even	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah i guess	1 0 1
uh-huh	0
do you like rap	0 1 0 1
yeah	1
that kind i kind of like some of it is kind of	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
pointless yeah	1 1
uh-huh	0
yeah yeah	1 1
yeah	1
i guess i don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
funny more satire kind some times um i'm with you though i like classical um	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
i don't like to listen to it all the time but um some of the time anyway i like easy listening	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
just kind of	0 1 0
you know i guess i don't care much for rock and roll any more i	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
used to like it all right but i don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason um	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
let's see country western uh i'm not quite as big on that some of it's okay um	1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah	1
uh some of it kind of	0 1 0 0 1 0
falls in the rap category i guess so	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
a lot of them_1 sound uh really similar yeah	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
yeah	0
hm	0
well that's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes too i guess they don't really	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
has kind of the same sound over and over and the other thing i don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
which	0
probably is just as well on some of them too	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah earlier things	0 1 0
well how did you like that topic	1 0 0 0 1 0 1
do you i don't	1 0 1 0
no i'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
i agree with it i think uh i think a company should be able to test at any any employee anytime they see fit	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
i just i just don't think there's a place in our en[vironment] environment you know in the work	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
force for drugs or alcohol either	1 0 1 0 1 1
right	1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
you did uh-huh	0 1 0
well i can sort of understand that uh but not being a teacher as you are you know i i was not quite as sympathetic as you know as i probably would have been if if kay were a teacher or something	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
but uh	1 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
that's right that's right	0 1 0 1
th[at's] that's right and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know but uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah i think so too i i agree with it uh i know kay's company you know they started it couple of years ago	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
and so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know and i thought jeez to me it's quite simple uh	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
you either need a job or you don't the the job is what provides all of your needs	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
and uh if they say hey you can't do this work i'd say hey i agree i don't i won't do that and i think most of them_1 have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah i[t] it it is i can see where you would think yeah that is belittling you know i'd probably feel the same way	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
if i had to do that	0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah that's true	1 0 1
you bet oh gosh they w[ould] they would really raise a stink if that was to happen	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
right yes i agree with that i i i wouldn't be opposed to it at all it's just our bleeding heart liberals that would	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
fight it too[th] tooth and nail you know	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
but uh well lynn i've enjoyed talking with you i don't know how long we're suppos[ed] to carry on a conversation do you	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh well we'd better keep talking because_1 i've not heard it have we have you heard it	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
anyway we both a sort of agree on it don't we	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
a[bout] about random testing	0 0 1 0
well you see i yeah yeah if you agree	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
is that right	1 0 1
you just don't think of that happening with teachers	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i really don't i when i think of drug testing i'm thinking of the	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh you kn[ow] outside of education	0 0 0 1 0 0
sure sure i know that but uh you don't think of that first hand normally	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
isn't that	1 0
isn't that mind boggling goodness it it is it's mind bogg[ling] and well you know i agree with you i know	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
teachers are	1 0
just like everybody else same problems the same uh good qualities as anybody else	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah yeah	1 1
y[ou] you think the benefit would be greater than the	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
and that was in your children's high school isn't that amazing	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
if it if it's if it was true there i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
you know because they represent a pretty good	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh	0
no certainly not uh certainly not	1 0 1 0 0 1
they don't need that example but	0 0 1 0 0 0
uh i don't know i've got mixed feelings about the topic	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
no okay	1 1
well	1
well i don't believe in drugs or alcohol but if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the tcat	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
they were talking about drug testing us	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and we found it belittling	1 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
that's true	1 0
but then you know at the same token i'm not against because i look at airline pilots	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
bus drivers	1 0
you know people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and alcohol	1 0
and	1
you know in those areas i really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
you know house	1 0 1
yeah i think it's just like anything else a new concept you know as i had said if i have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but at the same token in education we can't do d[rug] drug random drug testing on kids	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
you know i mean their rights are protected	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
what well but why if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
when we see them and they're you know under the influence	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
that's true	1 1
it's three minutes and the clicker comes in when it's time to	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah no	1 1
y[eah] well do we agree or unless it's it's not me you know here we go again i mean	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah you know i believe that truck drivers and people that have even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
and yet	1 1
uh well no it you know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and uh	0 0
yeah well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
it was on the news tonight	0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
then i think you know if it came push came to shove i'd probably be drug tested	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
you know because_1 it does you know	1 0 0 0 1 1 0
yeah because_1 you know as i say i'm sitting there fussing and fussing and yet i know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
in school as well as you know i presume out	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
um-hum and you know my children brought it to my attention i never was there to see it	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
and that's not giving a good example to students	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
sure i have a springer spaniel and her name is thumper she's about seven or eight years old	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1

it was very aggressive but all th[e] all three of them dog cat and	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
skunk used to chase each other all through the house	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
being the sofa and th[e]	0 0 1 0 0
blanket on the sofa nobody came near it when he was there	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh	0
yeah they um	1 1 0
ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and try to perfume them but	0 1 0 1 0 0
the glands had been removed so	0 1 0 0 1 1
right	1
one other question we had is why do you have pets	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah i always said if i die[d] well i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog that'd be the best way to be	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
well we had a german shepherd and he had dysplasia	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
so when he died we got a little one	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
but our shepherd was almost thirteen years old and it just you know it was almost cruel	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
because yeah he just he couldn't get up he couldn't walk so he was a hundred and twenty pounds so it was a chore	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
and then we've had three cats in our married life	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
and we've got a calico now	0 0 1 0 1 1

uh it's too much pressure you know if i have people over for dinner i like it to be nice but relaxed yeah	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
and so i don't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0

yeah well i'm planning a and naturally this is appropriate because_1 i'm planning dinner for um people tomorrow night and the next night hm on tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether so	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0

uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah that's a good idea	1 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
uh-huh uh-huh yeah	0 0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah yeah that's good well one of my favorites if i don't wanna have other people bring stuff i just wanna treat them is to make chicken and rice it's it's very easy to	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
you don't like it oh you do okay yeah i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken and then you	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then just	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just it fluffs up and it's really moist and	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
uh-huh ooh yeah	0 0 0
uh-huh yeah	0 0
hm well i'll keep that one in mind too yeah	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
yeah you can get away with it and you know in having a semi nice dinner or you know semi formal but	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
yeah you put in um let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice or	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
it depends on you can really vary it but you have to put the water in proportionally i can't remember i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
and	0
yeah that's flavor um-hum	1 1 1 0
yeah	0
uh-huh um let's see i think it was an hour i've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's it's really easy yeah	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
but i think it's about an hour or maybe it's only half hour hm um	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
you just until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone you know before it gets overdone	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah yeah um i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster but	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah well i liked it your idea too there	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
okay what kind of foods would you have	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh i do too	0 0 0 1
hum-um	0
uh-huh	0
well yeah you can't enjoy it right	0 1 0 0 1 0 1
that's that's what i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven it's everybody just	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
says how wonderful it is and it's it's like uh yes uh i that's one of those things that i got famous for in college people would come and say could you would you come over and make lasagna for me it's like well i can't really give you a recipe um i can	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
i can just do it so it's i like doing that kind of stuff and it's it's fun because_1 in fact that's what we had for a christmas party last week	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
we just had a bunch of people over and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and ah yummy	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh i do too in fact	0 0 0 1 0 1
oh oh good	0 0 1
uh i'd say one thing we've do[ne] have done quite a bit through the holidays just because_1 it's a real easy is just baked potato dinners	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
and have you like three or four couples come over and i'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
and it turns out great because i mean you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
but it's it's inexpensive plus it's real easy on the hostess because_1 you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it and you got a great dinner	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
it's it's real easy i like doing that part ah i'm in favor of very little clean up um very little planning because_1 we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games and	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
it's we invariably end up at my house since i've got two kids and that it's it's fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this we're done oh it's pretty cool	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
oh	0
oh	0
oh i love it	0 0 1 0
hm	0
oh	0
over the uncooked rice	1 0 1 0
oh	0
oh how neat	0 0 1
huh now i've done it with where you put you cook the ri[ce] well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and pu[t] a bit of white wine in it	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
and every once in a while i'll put in white i'll slice white grapes and i'll put it in there and	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
that's because_1 i'm not a real big wine person but i like it it it adds something to the chicken and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah it's it that was one of the first things i made for my husband because_1 it's like hm yeah i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
oh yeah	0 0
but then i di[dn't] i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice so just like in a thirteen by nine pan	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
hm	0
hm	0
uh-huh	0
huh	0
yeah yeah it's i i use that for brea[kfast] for rice and for when i cook pasta or something i'll i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
hm now that would be good how long do you have to bake it	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i do i do microwave too a lot it's	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
how long would it be in the m[icrowave] how long would it be in the microwave	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh okay	0 0
okay_1 do you just brown the chicken to get it colored or do you go ahead and let it cook through	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay hm	0 0
oh this is a beneficial call i like this yeah but that one's an easy one it's like just put in a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine put in garlic and onion powder	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
or chopped onions if you wanna do that you know wh[atever] whatever you however much effort you feel like putting into it but it it makes a great i mean m[y] i've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
and be[cause] because my daughter calls it her gravy and i mean she thinks it's wonderful i'm like good you're a picky eater if i can get you to ea[t]	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0

well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yes and the rangers go up a little bit um-hum	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
i think the entire baseball yeah they're the ones that probably are paying the highest	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous	0 1 0 0 0 1 1
no	1
that's right	0 1
what i saw on the news today that bue[chele] buechele was back just to visit	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
i'm awful sorry he's not still	1 1 1 1 0 1
oh i'm sure it was	0 0 1 0 0
pittsburgh yeah	1 1
yes sir	1 0
well what do you think of howse	0 1 0 0 1 0 1
who is the coach for the pitchers	1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yes	1
his assistant	0 1
um-hum	0
i really wish they could	1 1 1 1 0
see fit to get rid of howse	1 1 0 0 1 0 0
no no i really don't	1 1 0 1 0
and i'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but i'm not fond of howse and i'm not fond of grieves	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
well i'm just gullible enough that i think bobby valentine is um uh doing all right	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
and i'm sure well	0 0 1 1
oh i know i know so but i would like so much	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
for these rangers to get their act together and give um	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
oh uh nolan ryan the support he needs	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
i understand	1 1
well	1
i just oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this but i think with their new stadium they should go and let's us ha[ve]	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
uh baseball	0 1
well i've been kind of been intrigued with the rangers	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh	0
more so with uh	1 1 0 0
uh their management than anything else i'd i don't follow baseball that that closely	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
but uh si[nce] you know since i live here so close to arlington uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's the team that i've been kind of following	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
right	1
well i think that uh	1 1 0 0 0
you know with uh	0 1 0 0
so much controversy over ruben sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
you know i think	0 0 0 1
i'm not real sure about th[at] do you know anything about ruben sierra's uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the rangers will go up a little bit	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five mill[ion] that's a lot of money	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah they are	1 1 0
um-hum and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should uh	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh pay him what his salary's going to be	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a a free agent	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the si[x] you know the six million dollars a year this year	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh i think it was like a five year deal with uh	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
pittsburgh so you know he's real happy there as far as the rangers are concerned i think	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i think they need some definitely need some pitching	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh	0
and so i you know i	0 1 0 1 0 0
um the pitching coach	0 0 1 1
well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was go[ing] was helping out uh	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
his assistant and i think that's a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
oh you don't like howse huh	0 0 1 0 1 0
oh tom grieve	0 1 1
yeah i'm i'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh tom grieve yet	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
but howse might be a different uh situation and i think you're probably right that they	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
um	0
you do huh	0 1 0
that's contrary to uh popular belief you know	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
oh i know you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the rangers you know	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
and uh	0 0
yeah	0
well michael what do you think about um funding for aids research do you	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
oops	0
um-hum	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
well i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now you know	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
uh-huh yeah i mean i go ahead um-hum	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh yeah	0 1
yeah yeah i mean i i can see that research is needed and you know definitely i mean it's becoming a major problem	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right and i i feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer it's it's uh abstinence in certain cases and yeah and knowing you know	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
yeah um-hum	1 0
yeah	1
yeah i think for a lot of people it has so	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
so	0
uh-huh	0
drug addicts um-hum	1 0 0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
well yeah	1 1
boy th[at's] that's a hard issue it really is	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
yeah i mean i i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say um	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
people i mean in the meantime well someone who's not ready to give up drugs um you know if they're per[petrating] perpetrating the aids problem passing that on to each other then you know	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
yeah	1
uh-huh yeah	0 1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
yeah i haven't either i've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough and mostly that's what i've heard so i don't know	0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
well um uh that's something i've never thought a lot about um i've i work in a hospital and i've worked in the hospital for about fifteen years and i've taken care of a few aids patients	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
um when they asked us did did we want to um	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
keep it the same or uh spend more or spend less i think uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i think right now w[hat] what they're spending is adequate uh my for my personal opinion	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
um because_1 i think it's something that's gonna take them_1 a while to come up with a uh vaccine for i don't think it's gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and um so i don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now i think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know and uh what about you	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i'm not either i'm definitely not aware of how much	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh it's something i've never really kept up with at all	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um i don't kn[ow]	0 0 0 0
i'm not sure uh i know uh i've always thought more about the disease rather than the research you know what i mean and uh that sort of thing	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um if if we were talking about the money um i'd just have to say	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
what they're spending is probably enough simply because i don't know that much about it you know	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah i think so i think so	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah yeah	1 1
yeah well that's true that's true because um it's a such an easily preventable disease	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um	0
no it's definitely not	1 0 1 1
that's true that's true um myself um um i'm just recently or about to get a divorce	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh course i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything but it's sort of scary	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
to find yourself single again you know and um because you never know what's gonna happen you don't know who you're gonna come across you know course it's it's not that i'm wanting to	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
i'm not gonna wanting to go and have sex with everybody i see but it's something you got to think about these days a single person	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know and um i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry and um	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
certainly yeah	1 1
but um uh i know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything and uh i don't know i don't think that's a bad idea	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
i know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction it just sort of keeps that going	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
but um i don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas aids so far cannot be	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
you know so i don't know that i think that's i'm not t[oo] too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself i don't know what do you think about that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
it's it really is it really is they gave us a hard topic	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
that's true that's true	0 1 0 1
yeah you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an aids aids would have to have come first i guess as far as	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
something to uh to do about it so so i don't know um course there's so many things in the world where	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time and i don't know but um	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
but i've never looked into how much money they're spending i have i have no idea	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
but uh i really have never looked into it i have no idea um	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
yeah	1
yeah	1
right sure	1 1
yeah	1

before i had before we got our baby but	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah exactly	1 1
well one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
make a t-shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from the material from some material like flowers or something and make	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
heat and bond or whatever and then paint around it and i usually sew sew around the flower whatever first	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
and then i paint around it so you can't see the stitching as much	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
doe[s] does that make sense to you	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
so	0
oh	0
oh sure uh-huh	0 1 0
oh really	0 1
oh	0
well	0
yeah someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways and i've always after hearing that i always sewed it on even	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1

um yes which i was always amazed i have one of them_1 um but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
have you think children you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
i think when babies i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
are are wonderful and and they'll wear them_1 once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear your	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh yes i think it's very clever it's uh funny that you said that for christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it so i ha[d] i went and bought just some	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
cloth glue and glued it all back and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was salvageable and i	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
but it's so i'm familiar with that but i think you're very clever to um sew around the edges i think gluing alone	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
certainly would if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my pap[er] i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them_1	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait [un]til i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	1
yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that ca[nnot] glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
no we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
i think so it's just because they have to you know	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's a it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in iowa the state i'm from	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian i don't know if you've tried it	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
and they have on the ba[ck] it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah well wh[at] some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them_1 away cause there is no place to take glass	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
so	1
uh-huh	1
okay do they save like the paper the[y] they use like the office paper good because_1 there is a lot of waste there isn't there	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
right	1
right	1
right	1
yeah	1
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business	0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
yeah yeah and i think it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and i don't know it just may overwhelm us	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like i know amway i only use a couple things form amway that it says this is burnable material well	1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
and then just like the glass bottles th[at] that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in texas and there's no place i can take glass to	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
so i still throw away a lot of glass	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plas[tic]	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
okay so wh[at] now what are your opinions on recycling	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah i've heard that too	1 1 1 0 1
um-hum	1
well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them_1 and uh th[at's] i can't remember where i went to take them_1 but they wou[ldn't] they wouldn't take them_1	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
oh i know	0 1 1
there's no really recycling facilities	0 1 0 1 1
i think that's a good idea	0 1 0 0 1 1
besides well like a law or whatever and that's how it is in new york or isn't it	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
um-hum you get ticketed if you don't do it right	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah	1
plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
um-hum	1
yeah	1
uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle	0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah that's true	1 1 0
yeah i've seen them_1	1 1 1 0
um-hum	1
that take them_1 back	0 1 0 1
is texas one of them_1	0 1 1 0 0
yeah	1
no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at jc penney at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
program that's um company wide and i do the recycling for that	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah i know there's a lot of computer paper though that you can't use	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
but um we use to have uh i mean i i don't even remember how much money that they've um m[ean] i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program they've donated it to charities but i mean they've made a substantial amount of money from it	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
yeah	1
well now you see some of this stuff and you're and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why didn't you think of that before	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah that's true	1 0 1
yeah	1
do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
then that's pollution	0 1 1
yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
truly sad	0 1
uh	0
yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
or sources	0 1
that's what i would think	1 0 0 0 1
right	1
yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh any any industry that burns you know	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
but i don't know if that affects outside	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
you know i i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
right	1
yeah that is well that's destroying the ozone isn't it yeah	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
yeah that's it it's kind of scary	1 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
i think it will	1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
right	1
right	1
yeah in this area too since you know in texas we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
it just stacks up at the when the rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into fort worth or dallas	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
you don't have to have mountains there stopping it	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings and uh	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	1
um-hum	0
yeah	0
yeah	1
yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
well i guess we're uh	0 0 1 0 0
forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting f[uels] fuels are being experimented with ethanol and	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
other types of fuels	0 1 0 1
i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
i don't know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from what comes over the border from us	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
do away with the cfcs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
well it is scary and i think it will uh	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
i i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that in los angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using uh	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
barbecues gasoline lawn mowers	1 1 1 0
um and it's really bad in places like los angeles and it's gotten bad in denver and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
well that makes a lot of sense i mean i i hadn't thought about it that way but it it	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	1
no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a uh a whole	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
big structural change in the economy	0 1 0 0 0 1
uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and i[n] in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh i'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
okay well why don't you start because_1 it said i was suppose to ask you what do you	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
yes i do	1 0 1
oh my gosh	0 0 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
right	1
right	1
yeah	1
right	1
my mother-in-law finally they had to make a family decision there's seven children in my husband's family and fortunately four of them_1 live in the same home town	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and she has alzheimer's it was getting where she was	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
getting th[ings] dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this but they were very fortunate it's a small town and	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really doesn't nobody thought she would adjust but she's adjusted beautifully	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in colorado she's been taking care of him i don't know how much longer this can last	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and at that point because_1 he requires round the clock he can't do anything without her he doesn't know when to take his medicine	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
and it's really sad and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
uh my brother's are not interested in helping me so i would have to move him down here that way i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
you know where i can go see it i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
and	0
yes and some of them_1 are limited care too where people can do uh like they have apartment styles but that wouldn't work for him i think he's beyond that	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctor's are available if they need them and allows	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course i guess all nursing homes there is	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
but	1
right	1
yeah	1
right	1
yeah i s[ee] uh yeah and i think a lot of people who do it now in colorado it's interesting i talked to my mother they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and my mother could make it on that what she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then i would send it back to her so that's probably what would happen	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah it's unfortunate	1 0 1
right	1
yeah it's frightening and i guess uh i don't know how old you are i'm forty six you know we're the generation moving into this and i don't know how our kids are gonna take care of us	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
you know	0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
right [y]eah	1 1
i also fill in my generation a squeeze between	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and he's still living at home and i don't know how he's ever going to get on his own the way things are	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and so it's kind of sq[ueezed] you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but you see these people in their seventies yeah most aren't that's the problem	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
that's incredible	1 1
do you have any elderly relatives currently in uh in a nursing home now	0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
do you i have a grandmother she's a hundred and two	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
she'll be a hundred and three in august	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and we decided not to put her in a nursing home	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
she still has her snap she takes care of her own business this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
but with somebody that needs around the clock care i have seen my family age	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
i've seen them in the she's been there ten years now and i have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything i th[ink] i still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
and they needed some quality care i would put someone in a nursing home	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
oh well that's good	0 0 1 1
oh that is great	0 1 0 1
why yeah i'm sure you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
um-hum i i i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in austin	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
where	0
and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have we have to be a pauper	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
it it takes every penny they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care and that's the sad part about it	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum i think that's what most people do you just have to give it everything away	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
i i i work at a brokerage firm and i have seen so many people that just have to gift	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i can't imagine i'm twenty nine and everybody in my family's always had we don't have any children everybody that has has them_1 later in life so my my mother and my father are in their late sixties	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
so i mean they're not that far away	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
oh i know	0 0 1
it but yeah most people aren't	0 0 1 0 0 1
and that's the bad thing i would hate to have lived so long she lived by herself	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety one	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and just did everything and it but most people aren't l[ike]	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
okay um	1 0
do you wanna go ahead or	0 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right	1
i do too i like the idea i see a lot more um my children i have five children and they're all married	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and um i love seeing the men help the women so much and they both cooperate together oh and i think it's great	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
righ[t-	1
right	1
that's right that's right yeah i've always taught my men that they better clean up with their women and help them if they did that you know	1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
and they're they're good about it but it is neat to see them all work together and a big thing though i see all that most of the	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
most of the women getting married now uh go ba[ck] have gone back to you know they they stay at work or go back to work or whatever and they're well educated	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and i believe we'll see a lot more ceo's in companies they're having a fit about how little there are	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
and i think we'll see a lot more don't you of upper management	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
than we do now even	0 0 0 1 0
i think it'll escalate	0 1 0 1
and uh and i think black women now if in fact i work at a high school	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple months and already promoted and she's very sharp and i think that in the ethnic	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
thing will be you know is a good thing now they're moving them up and they're sharp and they	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
so you're going to see a lo[t] m[ore] a lot more of that in leadership i believe	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
right	1
right that's a shame	1 1 0 0
yes yeah but they wouldn't know what they're doing	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
but i'm not big on subserving as far as	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
to the men at all but i never have gone along with that you know even far back but i was brought up pretty good in a home that	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
years ago my mother was that way the same my b[oys] the our you know some people say oh the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs the inside jobs but we never were taught they had to do as much as we did so that was good	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
so that's i think that's good to keep the equal as far as	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
as uh not nece[ssarily] nec[essarily] uh necessarily by sex type thing	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
you know you should be able to accomplish as much and i think the uh attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you know you can do it if he can do it you can do it type thing	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right what about politics on it	1 1 0 1 1 0
do you think the political scene	0 0 1 0 1 1
yeah	1
i'm real di[sgusted] i'm kind of disgusted this year because i don't see many women into the political scene and i really think we should have more	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
political leaders in the women than we do up for and even for president and vice president this year there's nobody again i think they're all scared out after tha[t- after um	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh what was the lady's name that ran a couple of fitz[gerald] i forget her name now but you know who i mean	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah she took such a rough go of it and they ta[x] their tax deal and	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
right right but i wish they would get some more on tha[t] i really was disappointed this year when i see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um they i didn't see any of the women in there and that disappoints me	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
and right now i don't think we have too many tha[t] uh in the forefront schroeder's about the biggest one in washington	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
congress woman	1 1
and um other tha[n] uh you know we really	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
oh sure um well	0 1 0 1
i um went to school at madison for two years and they're really big on women's rights and and equal treatment	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
and so i i seen a lot of like rallies and things like that but um	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
i'm not that liberated i mean my mom's kind of old fashioned you know so i you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff but um i think it's	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i think it's interesting and	1 0 0 1 1
better for women to see that there's more more of them_1 doing men's fields i like to see that	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
and i don't like to see women you know like waiting on men hand and foot but you know i i believe in like sharing and doing things for each other	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
right	1
oh me too i hope that happens to me someday i mean i i don't mind doing stuff um i have a boyfriend and like i'll make him dinner and stuff but you know and he'll help me do the dishes i don't want him you know	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
expect to have to clean up then after yeah yeah so	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
right	1
um-hum	0
right	1
um-hum	0
oh	0
oh yeah um-hum	0 1 0
right	1
yeah	1
um-hum	0
oh me too	0 1 1
yeah i like to see that i think it's um	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
really neat to seeing all what educated minority um person who really knows what they're talking about and	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
it's just too bad that some people you know still look down on them_1 just because of their color you know especially black women	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
so	1
right	1
um-hum	0
right	1
right same here yeah	1 1 0 1
right same here	1 1 0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
yeah	1
exactly i i see more men um like participating in like the family things with children like you know helping to take care of them_1 more and	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
and um	0 0
um doing the jobs equally yeah	0 1 0 0 1 1
oh i'm not that big on politics i'm not that educated on it i'm	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
oh yeah i agree with that	0 1 0 1 0 1
oh i don't know yeah i know who you're talking about	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh yeah at least she was strong enough to like try it and you know	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
so that's good	0 1 1
um-hum	0
oh	0
um-hum	0
[o]kay	0
i think the first thing they said i've written this down so it would is it p[ossible] do you think it's possible to have honesty in government	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
or an honest government	0 0 1 0
yeah	1
right that's a good point	1 1 0 0 1
that's an int[eresting] yeah that's interesting i had read something one time and it was just applying to governments in general it was written many years ago	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
it said that is impossible to have	0 1 0 0 1 0 1
a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers	0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
and i thought that was interesting	1 0 0 0 0 1
it wasn't just talking about our government it was just government in general from times past you know on and	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
right and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for pub[lic] for but because they wanna be of service to us	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
or are they in there for their own gains and personally i feel it's probably there's probably some of each	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum yeah	0 0
yeah	0
oh yeah	0 0
and they talked uh the other let's see third question was how m[uch] how much self-serving for their own gains do you think goes on then they that's hard to answ[er] i'm sure there's a lot but i agree with you there's a lot in business i think that's just	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
i think that's very normal	0 1 0 0 1
that we should not ex[pect] i mean i think we put too much on politicians we expect them_1	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
to only be there to serve us you know	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
that's a problem isn't it	0 0 1 1 0
it's interesting because_1 i'm taking a texas government class right now and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
one of the things i always reali[ze] it's so easy to blame them to b[lame] a lot of times i think it's our own fault	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
they lie to us because we don't wanna hear the truth and if	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
if they tell us the truth we don't elect them_1 and	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
especially with all this front co[ver] stuff coming up here lately	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
about people's past and i don't know why anybody would wanna get under that scrutiny anymore	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
because it's i think it's gotten just care[less] well we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life and	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	0
you know i also think it'd be funny if we could kn[ow] know everything about the people that were in there and threw them_1 out i don't think there would be too many left you know	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
um-hum	0
uh at uh it's tcjc tex[as] tarrant county junior college yeah and it's really it's really enjoyable i like it	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
and they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption and i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1
yeah but that doesn't mean i don't think making laws will	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
stop it	1 0
i mean i don't know how many laws you'd have to have i mean you know	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
no sure didn't did it	1 0 1 1 0
so no i think you can legislate but i think there's no way that you'd eliminated all by legislating and we'd end up with so many more laws that	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know i mean i just think that's human nature that you're gonna have corruption	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
in government in business personal life i mean you know	0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0
right	1
yeah	0
yeah i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes but when i think about where i'd wanna go	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
you know this is still the best or i can	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
yeah yeah at it's worst i think we've got the best	1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
okay you're asking what my opinion about whether it's possible to have honesty in government well i suspect that it is possible uh i think it probably	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
but um	0 0
other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers b[ut]	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
right yeah but i think maybe a lot of them um say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more a matter of	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
not what can i steal while i'm in office but how many friends can i make while i'm in office and you know how good a name can i make for myself and so forth	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
so i guess it would be like anything else the president of general motors probably has the same	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
i think i'm	1 0 1
i think a little more honesty in campaigns would be more to the point if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh yeah	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah they say you get the government you deserve	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
it's hard to imagine	0 1 0 1
yeah and it almost seems like in order to avoid uh some of this scandal you would have to have the kind of life that you would only find in a say in the bobsy twins or something like that	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
so you're taking a government course at what at the university	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh okay	0 0
you can make laws against corruption but that doesn't eliminate it does it	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
well they've got laws against canni[balism] cannibalism but that didn't stop that guy in milwaukee did it	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
actually i think other countries may have it worse uh the japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal usually involving the prime minister or people very close to him it's so uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i've been around to a few other countries and i uh i i have not found one yet that i would rather live in i think uh	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
okay um chuck do you have any pets there at your home	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and what kind do you have	0 1 0 0 0 1
oh	0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh well we have a cat um he's probably	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby	0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
oh uh how's the disposition of your siamese cat	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
well yeah he's uh he has been really aggressive at especially towards my little girl for some reason he's uh	1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
been so mean to her and	0 1 1 0 0 0
we've had him for about two years and and he was so mean to her	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
um right after we first got him so we had him neutered and	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
and declawed and now he bites her he can't scratch her anymore he bites her	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah yeah he has a couple of times so	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
but he's a very	0 1 0 1
possessive cat he he loves my son it's his cat and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and he's so funny he just follows my son around just like a dog	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
he won't even let my son shower he meows and wants to get in the bathroom and while he showers it's so hilarious	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
so he's quite a animal	0 1 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because_1 we just couldn't have him being so	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so aggressive towards the girl but	0 1 0 0 1 0
uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit and we do keep our daughter away from him so	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
it is uh-huh we've we tried a dog um about_1 four years ago and we ended up with a	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh malamute and	1 1 0
some other kind of mix anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home so	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
we gave him up	0 0 1 0
and tried	0 0
yes uh-huh we're in a house but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog we couldn't allow him to run free so he was just chained up all the time and it was it was unfortunate	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
so have you tried any other pets	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh	1
oh	1
uh-huh	0
oh my word	1 0 1
oh my word	1 0 1
and do they they just paper train it or something	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah well rabbits are darling that would be fun if you could get them_1 trained otherwise they're pretty smelly um	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
huh-uh we don't have c[nn] we don't have cable	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh	1
oh	1
is that right oh	0 1 1 0
uh	0
uh-huh well that would be interesting to watch	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yes uh-huh elton we live out here by it's by ogden it's north of salt lake city utah	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and we really love it out here it's uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
kind of country we're we're only about ten minutes from ogden	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so we're kind of country but not too	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
not	0
no huh-uh do you	1 0 0 1
oh well see i'm getting so many calls to texas	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
oh well great yeah i've been doing it for about two weeks and uh no my	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
yeah i do	1 0 1
i've got a male siamese about a year old here i live alone in an apartment and uh	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
except for the cat how about you	1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
and uh he's been neutered and declawed so and he's an indoor cat so uh	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh that kind of calms him down for the most part and uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
how about yours	0 0 1
huh	0
and and you say you had him how long	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
two years	1 0
huh	0
does he bite her enough to draw blood	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
huh	0
yeah	1
yeah boy i guess well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess with the daughter he's all right you wouldn't want him to carry her off or something	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
sure	1
yeah yeah	1 0
is that the only pet that you have	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
i see	1 0
sure	1
no no i i live alone in an apartment and uh it's it's not that big that uh although i've heard rabbits are pretty good	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
you know i i saw something on cnn or on cable here uh	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
and in houses and they apparently uh especially when they're young when they bring them in uh	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
i guess i guess yeah and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either because_1 uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
yep that's right	1 0 1
did you see the the cnn the the dog show uh	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
they	0
i see well they have uh	1 0 0 1 1 0
uh a westmin[ster] they call it the westminster dog show uh uh i think it's in new york city at the at the gardens there once a year live	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and they had that on last week and that's really kind of something to watch uh it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
and uh some of the weirdest animals you ever wanna see on there some of them_1 are really beautiful too yeah so	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
yeah	0
so you live in utah do you	0 0 1 0 1 1 0
goodness	1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
well	1
do you all work for ti or or	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah yeah yeah	1 0 0
this is the very first one i've i've talked to you know	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
okay um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think uh next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
oh yeah	0 1
um-hum	0
hm	0
i see	1 0
uh well i'm my medical coverage is with an hmo um so	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
that's in my opinion that's gett[ing] that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
right	1
yes	1
that's right yeah i'm i'm fairly young myself i've only been	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and uh at that time i immediately joined the hmo and i never really	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the hmo and uh you know for me it's worked out real good	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
hm	0
um-hum	0
yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh georgia tech in the research branch and i guess	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right	1
well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who i work with	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
um	0
and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
right	1
um-hum	0
oh yeah	0 1
um-hum	0
okay_1 are there	1 0 0
are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benef[its]	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
covering medical costs for yourself or family members	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
yeah i thin[k] i work for a a public school system district and uh so it's different than a company where	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
the employee must pick up	0 1 0 1 0
a greater figure in the way of uh costs but i[t] overall um i've been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
is because of the cost of insurance	0 1 0 0 1 0 1
going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
it has not disturbed me any how about_1 yourself	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
right yeah our district did that	1 1 1 1 0 0
for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the hmo and um	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
i i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh	0
i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i i have to say it really works but again	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
it can be very stressful for you know those people	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
right but if you you know have a family and and um	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i i'm sure it would be very stressful and	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
you know good so	1 0 1 0
uh	0
oh all right	0 1 1
i do too are you talking about like spring break and right	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
right	1
it it really um	0 0 1 0
i don't think	1 0 1
most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly it is just	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
texas has really um	1 0 1 0
you know they want everybody educated no matter what it's costs uh and it it would be just	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the staff what do you do there	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
okay i li[ke]	1 0 0
well that's good yeah i would think that that type of	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
employment you're you're	1 0 0
one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
you know it's good that they allow you that	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
it um a[s] i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
many days off and um	1 0 1 0 0
we all look forward to it that's only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
continued to uh stay there	1 0 0 1 0
so	0
so how do you get most of your current event information	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
right	1
um-hum	0
i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
talking with people and just hearing what's going on but	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
just the regular channel just channel eight that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
so	1
oh uh-huh yeah	0 0 1
right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a c[andidate] candidate can get them to follow then the news will	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know kind of publicize his name	1 0 0 0 1 0 1
i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
right and the news too it just doesn't um cover a[ll] that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
and you know and and your ca[tastrophes] catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
right i	1 0
i used to read every month a reader's digest	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the w[ar] when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
but	0
right	1
well i um they even did a story on our news here in texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
outside of texas news you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
yeah well i guess you'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now yeah	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
right right yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but	1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
well duri[ng] see i'm going to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
and i don't watch tv as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the mcneil lehrer hour	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
oh really	0 1
uh-huh oh ch[annel] see channel where i am channel eight's um like public tv so it's kind of different	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
i think i think the uh	0 1 0 1 0 0
i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah exactly	1 1
uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r[ead] and probably read something on it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
yeah	1
what kind of uh see i subscribe to like science news and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
but other than that i don't really r[ead] i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
oh yeah	0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
well i remember dur[ing] back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the tv on because_1 that they were going constantly with that stuff	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
but uh	0 0
yeah	1
if they reported every m[urder] if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then o[n] on the olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
oh really that's gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the braves because they're uh they're in you know tr[aining] spring training or whatever and they did so well last year	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah it seems like	1 0 1 0
i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to s[ome] some channel for it but i don't have cable	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
okay eric um	1 1 0
are you married and do you have a family	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
okay	1
um	0
well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and then we divvy them up between	1 1 0 1 0 0 1
our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and so that does help that helps a lot	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and then um we don't have a lot ex[tra] extra for extra spending so it's pretty well earmarked	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
yeah ev[ery] every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
that's true	1 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
well it helps you to focus	1 0 1 0 0 1
where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the s[ame] the same frustration before you got on a budget but	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
huh and also we have found that if we write down	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
a[nd] and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
every paycheck	0 1
and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
just what you do spend and and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
we should because_1 it does help	0 1 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
just stick to that uh-huh that is	1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
that	0
that sounds like a really good idea	1 0 0 0 1 0 0
and it really helpful	0 0 1 1
um have you developed a savings plan or iras or anything like that yet	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
oh uh-huh	0 0
uh-huh	0
oh that's good that's a good feeling	0 0 1 1 0 0 1
my husband just graduated from the university uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
a year ago so finally finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh yes i am to uh both questions	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh yeah we do we um	0 1 0 1 0 0
uh basically there's the you know expenses that	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
and uh what's ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
you know what sort of range we're gonna	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
generally gonna shoot for	1 0 1 0
so what do you do	0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
wow	0
yeah	0
yeah all allocated out yeah	0 0 1 1 0
all the	1 0
checks yeah	1 1
right yeah we found that um	1 1 1 0 0 0
it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
the unnecessary expenses we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
money for things that	1 0 1 0
you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
because of this and and stuff like that so	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
that's a lot of money but	1 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that that helps if	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to uh uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
um so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and then once that was gone well if the entertainment amount was gone for the month oh it's gone	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
so	0
we we haven't we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh credit card debt and and all of that and we're just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah i	1 0
um-hum	0
a study	0 1
yeah	0
yeah i'm actually in the in the mas[ter]	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
hello ann	0 1
um the other day	0 0 0 1
i attended a conference here at utah state university on recycling	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and uh	0 0
i was kind of interested to hear because_1 they had some people from the epa and lots of different places	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and uh	0 0
they	1
had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
well it's not too new	1 0 1 0 0
oh	0
they really didn't propose any solutions actually they were	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the epa	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and uh	0 0
uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print and he was talking about um	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah we're doing some here in in cash valley the community here there's uh	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
we've actually got a kind of a nice set up we've got a	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
a fire hazard and make it into insulation	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them_1 because they're actually buying it and shipping it in from outside	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
get some sort of business to actually want it once you've collected it	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
and there's a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
oh i can't remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and it was really quite amazing because_1 he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them_1	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there's a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it to produce electricity	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
yeah and it's more than even paper or something like that there's more energy in it per pound or whatever	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well that was he didn't deal with that he just said burn it he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so it's not very practical is it	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah well real interest[ing]	1 0 1 0
um	0
not too much i'm	1 0 1 1
uh i got a bit actuall[y]	0 1 0 0 1 0
hello chuck	1 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um i didn't think that was a new revelation	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
right	1
so what what i[s] is the epa recommending now	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
why that's a that's a common problem now that seems that has happened in dallas as well as new york	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
right	1
well that's good	0 1 1
right there has to be a a reuse for it i mean that's why they recycle	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet and uh	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
i think they're even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
oh really	0 1
right	1
huh	0
well it's carbon so that makes sense like a carbon fuel of some sort but what	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
what about emissions	0 0 1
oh	0
okay	0
no well that's interesting i bet that was a good day at the uh conference then	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
did it change anything for you	0 0 1 0 0 1
[ok]ay	0
um	0
so what do you think um about putting an elderly in a nursing home	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
hm	0
um-hum	0
that's true yeah	0 1 1
hm	0
um-hum	0
that's true i never thought of that yeah	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
that's true until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yes they really are they don't like to keep them longer than a week	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
what do you mean	1 0 0 1
yeah that's true	1 0 1
yeah and it depends on how how sick the person is too and what you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah um i would personally like it if my parents	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help that's not always possible	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
but um	1 0
to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
right	1
um-hum yeah	0 1
that's true yeah	0 1 0
but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them_1 out	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
ahead of time	1 0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah that they're	1 0 1
yeah	1
right	1
an[d] know what they're doing with that	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
and she really liked the idea of of moving there she's not ill yet	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
but um she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and then she decided that um she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
and being a burden she's very independent	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so she's in this nursing home it's out in the country	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
and um she really enjoys it right now	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
right some support and then there's also a sort of a wing for those people that do get sick	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
and	0
what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and then so if she ever does become ill	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
um it'll be like family around her	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
yeah sh[e]	1 0
um-hum	0
no she loves it she had a great social life and she travels	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
and um it's in in missouri in the in the mountains and it's beautiful and uh i i hope that i have something like that	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
when i get older	0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
oh definitely it's	0 1 0
um-hum	0
right	1
okay	1
well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh sometimes it is there's no alternative uh you do not have uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family that is uh	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
in and who around	0 0 0 1
so sometimes it's not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
um especially after if it's after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sometimes you know it sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
um-hum because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them_1 out much faster than what they're really able to	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
but so so there is some good to it uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job you know the fam[ilies] well the families do not necessarily	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh know what to do with them_1 and they don't wanna take the responsibility so they will put them_1 in a nursing home	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
so you see uh there's both sides to it too what do you think	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
that's true	0 1
well i think that's also where you're gonna to have a lot of people who are going to it's there's not a choice it's because_1 there it's not economically feasible even to put them_1 in a nursing home	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either medicare or insurance to cover it	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
so	0
yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i know some el[derly] unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
i guess it's alzheimer's or where they wander or or um	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
confused or have some mental problems	1 0 0 0 1 1
and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah so so there's different types of nursing homes i think	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
that's right and i i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i think i think of the um	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and the family that's going to be uh effec[ted] effected by it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
and uh you know sometimes it can those choi[ces] those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when they're	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
okay i thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um	0
well i i do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for for my wife and for me and um	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
outstanding and and every two or three months	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
update that and every once in a while	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
make a list of what we spent that month but i doubt i do it more than three times a year	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and	0
no i work with them_1 all day yeah i'm in computer science yet i i do everything on paper uh i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing because_1 it's all pretty round numbers	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
yeah i	1 0
um-hum	0
yeah it's a pretty	1 0 0 1
straightforward	1
it's almo[st] i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
you know fancy budgets it seems like if you're getting to that level y[ou're] you're not in real good control	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
actually i'm i me[an] i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
because that way it's a record of everything and i don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh	0
hum	0
yeah i guess if that's	1 0 1 0 0
if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
sure	1
do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that or	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
well that's good to know	0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
it seems like it's absurd the number of people who had to having to pay somebody to do it	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i	0
yeah just the form yeah	1 0 0 1 1
yeah and a lot of them_1	0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
i	0
i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer to too much stuff like that because i wanna make sure that that i	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i keep	1 0
on top of the numbers and understand what's going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and	0
yeah we have the same thing	0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
sure	1
okay	1
um-hum	0
um-hum do you use a computer	0 1 0 0 0 1
oh	0
uh-huh	0
yeah mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
when um he was a marine he went to saudi arabia and while he was gone	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i got all of our bills paid off so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
you know so they come in i pay them_1 and that's it you know that's about the extent of it you know	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i don't really have this major budget or anything i just really i'm real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and um just real careful with the money you know	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
what little we have so that's what i do	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
no	1
huh-uh	0
you know i mean i i i've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know you buy something on credit and you pay twice as much for it when you get done	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
you know so	0 1 1
uh-huh	0
i don't have too many wea[knesses]	0 1 0 1 0 0
i don't have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them_1	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
you know it's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person it's like oh well that's on sale let's go grab it you know so um	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
and if you don't have the money then use the credit card so i got rid of them credit cards	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know	0 1
yeah that was my weakness it wasn't bad i mean i didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that just i just learned that that wasn't for me you know	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
so	1
but i self employed	0 1 1 1
you know i have my own little cleaning business type thing so um i keep	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
no it's not hard i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and um you know what it's gonna have to go for that month and	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
you know it's not that not that hard	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
not at all	0 0 1
so	1
i always do my own income tax	1 0 1 0 0 0 1
you know do you	0 1 0 1
huh	0
rea[d] all you got to do is read a book	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
it's dumb you know i guess if you had some really complicated	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
stuff but i don't so i don't mess with it	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
but i don't use a calculator either you know i don't i don't have that mu[ch] that many you know things to add up so	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh yeah	0 1
and we have a i i bank at ncnb here and they have a number that you can call in and i always call in like	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
once every other week or so and i will um check off what checks have cleared and	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
do you do that	0 1 0 1
you do too and i always check them_1 off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because_1 i always want to know exactly what i have	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know i do that real often	0 1 0 0 1 1 0
i do that so	0 0 1 0
anyway	1
okay_1 so what are what are your views o[n] on capital punishment	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yes	1
so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
yes that's similar to georgia uh	1 0 1 0 1 0
that's probably true considering	0 0 1 0
yes yes um i guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
yes	1
right that would be the intent of it	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
well i think it would be more successful if it was applied	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals yeah if if the person who's gonna commit the crime knew that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh i'm a research engineer i work uh f[or] with georgia tech	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um	0
yes	1
hum	0
um-hum	0
um that's probably true but i guess	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
there's other factors that but pu[mping] pu[mping] pumping more money into the school system is a good thing but it's not gonna	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh i see	0 0 1
um-hum	0
um	0
so that's a difficult situation	0 0 0 1 1
um	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
well that's probably true wh[at]	0 1 0 1 0
hum	0
yeah i guess that's not an easy solution there's there's no easy solution for that	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
i'm sure it is yeah	0 0 0 1 1
hum yeah i don't i don't certainly capital punishment isn't gonna solve a lot of problems but	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh	0
i guess i am for certain cri[mes] yeah in certain crimes	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
um premeditated murder	0 1 1
crimes of that nature i think should definitely any mass murderer type individual	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
hum	0
um-hum	0
well you always have castration	0 0 1 0 1
yes i read about that	1 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
i have ambivalent feelings because i don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
but on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain you know texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
and it's eating us alive budget wise	0 0 1 0 1 1 0
and um	0 0
yes we do practice capital punishment but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because_1 i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody tha[n] than it does to keep them_1	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
well i think capital punishment is supposed to be	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
primarily a deterrent to other people	1 0 1 0 0 1
you know who would see it	0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah but i'm not sure	1 0 1 0 1
how successful that is	0 1 0 0
quicker maybe yeah	1 0 1
um-hum	0
what what kind of work do you do	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
hum well see i'm a school principal	0 1 0 1 0 0 1
elementary school	1 0
and in a very poor section of town with pr[edominantly] predominantly anglo kids	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
and i see kids already that are gonna be criminals	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
in spite of everything we can do	0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
that i mean course you couldn't do that because_1 you got to do something with the ones that are already there	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
but i think if we would make a bigger investment in kids	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
we'd have fewer decisions to make	0 0 1 1 0 1
down the road you know	0 0 1 0 1
oh yeah	1 0
well i'm not talking about_1 just in the school system	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
see i'm talking about_1 like in in uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and	0
reared	1
uh i know institutions don't work that well but it's a bad day because_1 because_1 i have all these kids through my office i have a school of five hundred and thirty seven kids	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
five hundred of them_1 are good solid kids and i have the same thirty seven in my office every day	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
some of them_1 in the penal system	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
and you know you just see those kids going down the road now not all of them_1 will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them_1 have already been in youth centers	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
and that kind of thing and if we had something to do before they get to be full blown adult criminals	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
and i'm not talking about_1 necessarily in the school system i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
i think that's one reason we have problems in school sys[tems]	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh and some of them_1 are our problems but a lot of it's because everything society wants we're supposed to do	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
but that's another subject but	0 1 0 0 0
anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are gonna end up	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
where somebody has to make a decision what to do with them_1	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution but	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
it would be money better spent	0 0 0 1 0 1
than do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to harvard	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
that's true	0 1
statistically that's true	1 0 1
um-hum	0
are you for it	0 1 0 0
i'm for it in in some cases yeah	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
what kind of crimes would you do use it for	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
i i would consider it for sexual abuse of children	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
on going	1 0
you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
well you know somebody elected that recently	0 1 0 1 1 0 0
and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
but uh	0 0
right okay	0 0
how many kids do you have	1 0 0 0 0 1
right	0
uh-huh	0
no	1
yeah w[e] we been married for two and a half years we've been trying for about two years but no luck yet hopefully	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh had	0 0
she has three kids eleven nine and eight	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
it's all right	0 0 1
okay so it keeps you bu[sy] do you have a lot of activities with your kids	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh so they're pretty good kids huh	0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
well we had ni[ne] well growing up i guess i can talk about us uh we had nine kids in our family we had eight boys and one girl	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
but my dad um yeah and the time that my we spent with our dad was he owned his own business so we worked with him most of the time	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
so that's how we spent most of the time with him yeah	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
that was the dead giveaway huh	0 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
oh	0
which that	0 0
i was gonna say my sister wasn't spoiled very much	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah that's exactly what it was	0 1 1 0 0 0
but	0
uh-huh	0
oh	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
well	0
yeah it's like you said it's you know to each his own i mean we're planning on having my wife stay home and but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
right	1
oh	0
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
well that's good sounds like you're have a handle on it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um no not right now right right well we just moved down here we used to live up in seattle	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
f[or] for a couple years	0 0 0 1 0
it's it's no problem here yeah we really liked it up there but then when	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yes	0
i think w[e] i think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children we have three children who are eleven nine and eight	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
so this is a big issue with us although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but perhaps they are looking for uh words to be said like day care and quality time and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
anyway you don't have children	1 1 0 0 1
but you're married	0 0 1
oh	0
you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually i'm getting a call i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting could i ask you to hold one minute i'll be right back excuse me just a moment they're gonna get mad	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
hello i'm so sorry that was my daughter's brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow brownie meeting	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
well i don't wanna i don't want this to be a unilateral conversation but yes we do both my husband and i work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
and the school years are wonderful they're just wonderful the kids they're real people and they're interesting and they they have all their own activities and um	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
i think as parents we really enjoy them_1 and in our own personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel i'm su[re] i'm sure that's coming though but they're wonderful kids	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
you had eight boys and one girl	0 0 1 0 0 0 1
are you mormons	0 0 1
because_1 with utah and the large family	0 0 1 0 0 0 1
well we're catholics i came from a family of five i had four brothers the only girl	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i never felt spoiled in fact i always felt my toys were destroyed	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
no usually busy fighting for survival	1 1 0 1 0 1
well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here um	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
that i think um	0 0 1 0
i don't know it's an interesting phenomena i happen to um i'm a pediatrician my husband is a physician so um	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i i teasingly i talk to parents about this a lot uh children i i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
um need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home i really believe that	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
and it has um	0 0 0 0
helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age and i think our kids are real secure	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
i really think it's true for our family and i think it has worked very well	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
there's no question i think that's really the best if if a woman is happy doing that i hate to put it quite that way	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
i was twenty nine when i had my first child and um i would not have	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
been real fulfilled i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother but	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
um i liked i like the way i did it i sort of worked half time i had very flexible hours	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
i nursed all three of our children till they were at least a year and i you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um	0
and i think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
some babysitting groups again i know it sounds like a rationalization but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they they learn to share	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they're secure i think that helps	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh yeah hope so so your wife does she work right now	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
she's out	0 0
so you're still trying to dry out	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh well	0 1
anyway i uh	1 1 0
i uh oh i i did forget to ask you what is your name by the way	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh you're ann hi	1 0 1 1
but um	1 0
anyway i uh lot of lot of s[tuff] interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if we're going to	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
talking about the subject to[night] tonight which is some i guess criminal courts the	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
yeah the the one of which was uh	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
something something that's been going on because of the rodney king trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh ye[ah] yeah well the the uh the the people that	0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
the the the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
um it's in ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah it was everywhere	1 0 0 1
so you know and i i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
exactly you know um the	1 1 0 0 1
you know i i'm kind of torn on this issue it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
but on the other hand is it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
i um	0 1
they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i i rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
oh here we go again folks kind of stuff	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
no no i you know on on on one hand y[ou] on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's th[ey] they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy	1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um	0
um-hum	0
well	0
yeah	0
um	0
i don't know you know and and again there's something else th[at] you know there was a	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh i[t] something else along those lines there was a girl	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
out here named latausha harlins i don't know if this this got this got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the rodney king problem um	1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
girl walked into a korean owned store and uh they she had a dispute black girl	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store the owner of the store popped her	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
yeah and and well of course the you know the criminal case went up and and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
uh practically a suspended sentence i mean it was	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
it was just she gave her no time in jail and and you know all of these things and then oh there's uh we have these we have people wandering around to with petitions trying to get the judge	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah yeah	1 1
yeah it would make it would make life easier yeah but	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
um-hum	1
um i'm ann	0 1 1
criminal courts yes	1 1 1
oh really	1 1
right	1
how is it i can't i'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
oh	1
well that videotape was just horrible	0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
oh i agree with you but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff	0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
right	1
exactly	1
based on fact right	1 0 1 1
how interesting ooh	1 1 1
so what's the prevailing thought within the community	1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
i mean you know what the news media's gonna make of it but what about the community	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
oh my goodness that can't be good for los angeles either	0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
oh exactly	0 1
unfortunately that kind of thing is not	1 1 1 0 0 0 1
limited to	1 1
uh a big city like los angeles you're going to have it	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
just about anywhere	0 1 1
there but that's that's interesting	1 1 0 0 1
what about the judge who's hearing the case is he gonna be impartial is he going to be a g[ood] a good adjudicator	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
oh really	0 1
oh my goodness	0 1 1
to get that judge recalled i would think	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
hm that's almost when you kind of wish that there where st[andardized] standardized sentences	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
it would uh you would know the whole world would know what you were facing	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and then it's a matter of of deciding g[uilt]	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
okay well um i used to work in a day care center i worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center and it is	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
they can be deceiving to people i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in tyler who had two or three um centers	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
all over you know the um city and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and um to check in on them_1 when they're not expecting it because they do do things differently when you're not around	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
so	1
um-hum	0
right	1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
well this one was set up good i mean they had two teachers to every room	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
um sometimes three and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
the problem i had was that	0 0 1 0 0 1
they did not show affection to the children enough they did not show them care to these small children who are being left	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um they	0 1
one time i picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side and down the other you know he said you are gonna have every child in here wanting you to pick them_1 up	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and i said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
so um	1 0
yes	1
right they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the um three three year olds	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives you know just like that	1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
you know they really did separate them_1 well it was just the teachers themselves	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
right but yeah that they're not	1 0 1 0 1 0
yeah their system	1 0 1
right but their but their system was was great but um the	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
you know the caring just wasn't there the one woman that taught that did the babies	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
i worked with her and she was fabulous she loved them babies and she loved them_1 and cared for them_1 but um every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
um you know would make me a nervous wreck so you know	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and uh with no any type of emotional	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
you know getting love getting care they're just there	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
you know going through this routine which is lousy	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
uh-huh	0
yeah you don't see that much	0 0 1 1 0 1
that's cute	0 1
yeah that has to be with a day care center	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i've never heard of that that's that's a new one on me	0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
hm	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
well that i know wh[at] the things that we kind of looked at is is you wanna see how many teachers you have	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
and and how many kids they have and how they break it up	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
because we had we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
it it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because_1 my wife we kind of bartered my wife did artwork for them_1 and then you know so we got our	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh day care free	0 1 0 1
but they didn't have enough teachers	1 1 0 0 0 1
and	1
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
hm	0
yeah	1
did did they separate them_1 by age group	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
because_1 i'd think you know i think that's one thing that was important	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
it it sound yeah	0 0 1 1
it sounds like to me your your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
affectionate people that they're they're kind of par[ents] maybe parents themselves or something	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
uh	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah i i i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
doctorates and phd's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
an[d]	0
the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations but	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them_1 and stuff you know but he was actually the more	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
um	0
the more uh what demonstrative type the more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and it it it was kind of interesting to see that that that it was actually the man in the group that	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
that did that side of it an[d]	0 1 0 1 0 0 0
yeah so they had a really nice balance we liked that one in fact it was called humpty dumpty play school or something but they also did	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
you know obedience obedience was important	0 1 1 1 0 1
and you know so they u[sed] you know they used uh	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
and it's it's it's one uh i can't remember what they call it exactly but y[ou] you just stand them_1 in front of the clock and you know it has a second hand that goes around	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and they have to stand there	0 1 0 0 1 0
um	0
what's our topic	1 0 1
taxes	1
right um	1 0
what do you do	1 0 0 1
i guess that i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
right	1
um sure	0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right	1
um-hum	0
right	1
uh well no i can't really complain i'm a student um and i i work as a co-op at uh georgia tech research institute and uh	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
i'm gonna get back most of what i earned i mean most of what i pay in taxes and uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
and uh one one of my parents is still claiming me hm	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
i'm sure	0 1
i went uh well i did work um	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
just various jobs for some time but i i didn't make enough money to really	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
make too much of a difference right	0 1 0 0 0 1 1
no no i haven't	1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
hm	0

so uh i'm i haven't made use of that	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
physics	1
everybody says that	1 1 0
um	0
um i haven't i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet actually um	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
the the degree i'm getting is physics there's a different one for applied physics so i guess you could call it more straight stuff	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
than applied	0 1
i doubt about that are are is america i mean are we pretty	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
pretty steep compared to most countries	1 1 0 0 1 0
nah i don't think so either	1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
taxes do we pay too much	1 0 0 1 0 0
well do we	1 1 0
um	0
my tax bracket is is pretty high up there i pay the i generally pay the maximum tax bracket and uh i think that we're paying too much because i don't have any children	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and i pay a lot on property taxes	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
i don't have any um i don't you know i don't use an awful lot of city services it it you know it's like i have to work	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
but uh i have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and um y[ou] there's so many people who wanted a bit of the federal money	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
or the state money or whatever it is and i just sometimes many times i end up feeling like i'm paying too much in taxes	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
how about_1 you do you pay too much	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
well when you	1 0 0
when you go out into the uh	0 0 0 1 0 0 0
when you go out into the working world i[t] it it changes quickly um you look at your paycheck and you go oh my gosh where did it all go	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
um what kind of what kind of uh	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
well have you paid a lot of in ta[xes] have you been out working and then gone back to school or are you did you go directly from high school into into college	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
to worry about it	0 1 0 0
have you have you been active in in politics trying to	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
concerning this have you like worked on a political action committees or something like that	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i uh i haven't done any of that type of work myself um	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
but every once in a while when i hear up here at at um in dc area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the congress um	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
congress has added too towards a members bank there you know there's a bank that they all bank with and i guess it went defunct recently	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and one of the congressmen has has written in the last three years al[most] about a thousand bad checks	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
and we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho[se] all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
and um it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to dc anyway it's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um i i i think we pay too much and i've i look at my paycheck and i make	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
well let's see they take out in state and federal taxes i think i pay	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
forty two percent	1 0 1
forty two cents out of every dollar i make goes to	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
the government and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes and they charge me all these others and it's just too expensive i can't believe that	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
i i'm just thankful that i don't get all the government that i pay for	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know what i mean	0 1 0 0 1
do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
what are you studying down there	1 0 0 1 1 0
physics ooh that sounds like a fun fun field	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
scientific heavy science are you like in the particle particle research or	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
anything like that or is it more um applied physics	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
okay well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
actually i don't think we are	1 1 0 0 0 1
um like like europe	0 1 0 1
um england	0 1
i know the taxes are a lot higher	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but they do have socialized medicine and things like that	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
and um i know th[at] i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that um	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0

no i haven't heard her	1 0 1 1 0
oh okay	0 1
oh really	0 1
i don't believe that we're	1 0 1 0 0
the recycling program here is just terrible i mean it's hard to find places to go i mean kroger does a couple things they i don't think they do they do newspapers	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
the one in florida is so cool because_1 they pick up everything they pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
they pick up everything	1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
i know it i know it it piles up	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
i just don't know	1 0 0 0
i just don't know and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because_1 mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center you can't really unload all your stuff	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
i know it i know	0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah	1 0
the	0
um-hum	0
well i mean it's really you ought to because the	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
the the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything	0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and since we go there all the time i mean	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
probably	0
be at all	0 0 0
oh by the way my name is julie	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
hi	1
i'm from atlanta	0 0 1
neat	1
i just think that everybody ought to do it	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
oh yeah they have uh	0 1 1 0 0
uh	0
what i what i used to uh now that i don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and then go and hand them_1 to them_1 the next time and use them_1 over and over	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
an[d] but also most places i think like big star does and i'm not sure if kroger does or not but	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah and they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
can bring them_1 in	0 0 0 1
i know it i know it	0 1 0 0 1 0
it it really is a small hostile planet	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
did you know that	0 1 1 0
no really not did you know that like something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper	1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
filled with paper	0 0 1
huh	0
well it is it is though	0 0 1 0 1 1
it is because_1 they	0 1 0 0
well	1
they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper you know	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
takes something like twenty times as long to decompose you know you can bury a piece of yellow paper an it will still be there in a couple of weeks	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it'll be whole	1 0 0 1
you'll be able to read off of it	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
um hum	0 0
well white paper's bad too they they treat it too	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i'm sure that's fine i'm sure	0 1 0 0 0 1
maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
maybe	1
yeah	1
you think	0 1
i don't know well i mean	0 0 1 1 0 0
i think we've kind of you know i mean everybody [every]body	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
if everybody had a computer	0 1 1 0 1
we would no longer need paper at all	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
i would love that	1 0 1 0
so what do you think about uh the recycling programs in atlanta julie	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
i don't know there's there's big bins out there i don't know if they ever get	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i i really don't know what the details are there should be someplace where you could call and find out as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
thing to you but	1 0 1 0
i think there should be some kind of curbside service that's the only way i could really	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
during the summers like the	1 0 1 1 0
around where i live the uh	1 0 0 1 0 0
homeless people see[m] i mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff and they'll go around and collect cans and aluminum stuff and so we used to just save them_1 up and then they'd come around and we'd give them_1 to them	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
but when during the winter time i think they they move south or something so	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i don't do that anymore and the the recycling at georgia tech like that um outside the uh student center	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
they never empty those things	0 1 1 0 0
they just overflow	0 0 1
so what's a guy to do	0 1 0 0 0 0
you know	0 1
i asked myself	0 1 0
really	1
huh well i you know it's true hadn't thought about that	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
that is very inconvenient inconvenient even	0 1 0 0 1 0
but uh	0 0
so you do recycle don't you	0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah i'm kind of i'm kind of bad about it	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
but if i if see a if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
i'll throw it in there but i don't really i don't ever take anything	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
but wait i've never seen you before who are you	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah my name's bill well	0 0 1 1 1
hi	1
me too	0 1
crazy	1
um	0
well	1
is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy julie	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
do they do like wh[at] what about like um what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
really	1
what about like those grocery bags	0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
aha	0
those petroleum products are gonna kill us	0 1 0 0 0 1 0
it's hostile planet i think julie	0 1 1 0 1 1
the petroleum pretty much i mean those petroleum products i think are the big uh	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know	0 1
the great satan of the recycling	0 1 1 0 0 1
hm paper just seems so innocuous	0 1 0 0 0 1
paper doesn't seem threatening at all you know	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
it comes from trees how can it be bad	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
they treat it with chemicals or something	0 1 0 0 1 0 1
why can't trees break down i don't get it	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yep	0
oh	0
really	1
huh	0
i'm gonna switch from those yellow legal pads then	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
i'm glad you told me that because i use those at work where i work and uh	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
but i can just forget that from now on i'm going to use i'm going to switch to the white ones	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bam[boo] you know bamboo stuff from the	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
from the banks of the nile	0 0 1 0 0 1
you think so	0 0 1
tablets	1
i think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
no	1
what do you think	1 0 0 1
kind of radical i know but	0 0 1 0 1 0
that's true	0 1
if everyone had a two-way wrist watch tv's on their wrist like uh dick tracy	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
okay	1
so	1
what kind of experience do you do you have then with child care	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
does it say something	0 0 1 0
okay	1
well	1
does it usually make a recording or s[omething]	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
okay	1
okay	1
um-hum	0
i have three	1 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah i do	0 0 1
yes um i don't work though but i used to work and when i had two children	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit but	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
i don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
but does your sister live in a big community	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	0
oh really	0 1
um-hum	0
um	0
um-hum	0
wow	1
how lucky	0 1
i i know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids and but	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
the community i'm in is not a real large one so there are a lot of people who babysit in their home that you know you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
to yeah to get references and that so	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
but um	1 0
i i do[n't]	1 0 0
don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
simply because_1 there's so many kids and so many	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
yeah and um you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things but and they're expensive and	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
or they just watch them and let them_1 play and things like that but	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
take a long time to find the right place	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum when he starts toddling around and stuff yeah	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum it would be hard i think it would be kind of stressful it would be nice to have him around	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but um seems like you know go[lly] what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang or	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
you know at the wrong time but	1 0 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
well when you have kids will you work	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
do you work now	0 0 1 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um yeah uh actually i teach my kids at home	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
so i'm here all the time	0 1 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
yeah	1
so	1
not it depends on the state you live actually some laws	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
absolutely prohibit it some states um say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesn't yet	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
say that and i'm not a certified teacher i went to college but i	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
and so	1 1
one of them_1 was for a couple of years	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
and so you know my oldest	1 1 1 0 0 1
he was and then my youngest two have never been	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so	1
anyway but we don't	1 0 1 0
i guess	0 1
i think um	0 1 0
i wonder if that worked	0 1 0 0 1
i think it usually does you might try um	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i don't know hold it down a little longer	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
okay i	1 0
well i don't remember it seemed like it did but it might not i guess i guess	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
we can start um	1 0 1 0
no i don't i don't have any kids i um my sister has a she just had a baby he's about five months old and she was	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
worrying about going back to work and what she was gonna do with him and	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the different do you have kids	0 1 0 1 0 1
oh really	0 1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
um yeah she lives it's a it's a fairly large community she um got real lucky though she had a boss who um moved into a larger office	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and she's able to take her baby to work with her	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
and it's a small office that she works in	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
and um	0 0
it's a it's a legal firm office and it's just one lawyer and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office there's no one else that works there	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby so it works out pretty good for her	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah so it's fairly safe	1 0 0 1 1
worried that they're not going to get enough attention	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yes	1
yeah and you and you don't always even know if it's it's	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
gonna be the right place or not	1 0 0 1 1 0 1
anything i guess could happen	1 0 1 0 1
because after	0 1
i guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah when when he's not when she can't	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
keep control of him and he starts crawling that's	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
i think she has problems with that too	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
i don't know that's something i've considered um	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
i always kind of think it would be neat to	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
be able to watch them_1 and be there for them_1 all the time	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
is that what you do	0 1 0 0 1
oh so they don't go to school is it like um	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
oh what's that called it's a	1 1 0 1 0 0
correspondence school they do it at home	1 1 0 0 0 0 1
that's interesting do you have to have any special training	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
so they haven't been to public schools at all	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
hm	0
so you've never had	1 0 0 0
okay so i guess it starts recording now	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in we live in the saginaw area	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum and i'm not real familiar with uh anything that i i[n] fact the far as i know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here and uh or the grocery story or anything in this area yeah	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
really	1
that is pretty good i'm we're originally from another state and i know in the state we were from that they did that ty[pe] similar type thing the city brought out	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
you know se[parate] tra[sh] separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it you know	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0

get anything back on it or do you get money for it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
oh	1
really	1
right	1
right and now now most of them_1 are th[e] throwaway	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
a[nd] yeah i think now they're a lot more expensive than that um	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
i bought some cokes the other day in the br[ead] the little bottles	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
you know and i think the bottles were like	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
i know they were at least ten cents apiece i was trying to figure out how i was like god how much were those bottles you know and it was they come in like uh eight an[d] and eight and ten packs you know	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
instead of six packs and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles you know i was like god almighty costs more for the bottles than it did for the cokes	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1

saginaw	1
really	1
the rec[ycling] we live in plano	0 0 1 0 0 1
and	1
they started off recycling by	0 0 1 0 0
um	0
putting the i think at each wal-mart they had some recycling	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
dumpsters and things like that which i[t] now i guess the uh city h[as] has bought these	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
big green trash cans and uh	1 1 1 1 0 0
we they have a recycling truck that comes around now	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
and you separate your glass and	0 0 1 0 1 0
paper	1
and uh aluminum	0 0 1
and you set it out and they pick it up and i[t] it works real neat they seem to be having a real good response	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
but	0
did they	0 1
did they like on bottles did they give you a	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
so many cents back for	1 0 1 1 0
for cans even i've seen that i[n]	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
really	0
no i've just i noticed in iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
per aluminum can	1 0 1
so you don't see too many thrown out around the streets	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
even bottles you know all kinds of bottles they they	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
they really charge people to uh i guess when you purchase them_1 and and then when you turn them_1 back in	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
i know i remember the old days as a kid where	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
a bottle was a nickel an[d]	0 1 0 0 1 0
right so maybe that's one thing they could do to	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
well that's	0 1
right	1
that was my brother's first job in a grocery store he was in the bottle area	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
it's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over but but it's uh	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
it's quite they say that the green glass now that there's a big glut	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
of green	0 1
wi[th] the green glass yeah it's amazing	0 0 1 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
right	1
right yeah it's i notice the plastics have sort of	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
faded away the milk jugs it it's	0 1 0 1 1 0 0
people just they they really don't uh there's too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah it's i don't know it it can be it's not as easy	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
collecting you know clean junk as they say	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
that's right that's right	0 1 0 1
it's like washing the dishes before you put them_1 in the dishwasher	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
we all do it	0 1 1 0
well it was nice talking to you	0 0 0 1 1 0 1
well i think i think two or three minutes is fine an[d] yeah	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1

less fortunate or whatever you wanna call it part of town and their schools are kind of rundown and	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
um older and they don't really	0 1 0 1 0 1
offer as much i don't know as uh the school that my girls are in i don't really think that's fair you know um	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
but you know i'm happy with what they're in so	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
go ahead	0 1
um-hum	0
wow	1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right	1
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
right	1
also um the the family environment	1 0 0 0 1 1
you know you can come to south tyler where i live and you have got room mothers in every room you've got art mothers you've got every every holiday there's parties	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
all the kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something you can go to north tyler to the schools and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
you know um	1 0 0
that has a a whole lot to do with it you know as far as their learning i mean if the parents aren't um	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
you know they really don't have much of a chance at all and	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
huh	1
oh why are you you j[ust] they just don't i mean i mean i'm i'm up there at my kid's school	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i know what they're learning and if they're up i call and find out you know is she having problems does she need help with anything no she's doing fine okay you know um	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
and i i know kids that their parents could really give a rip and the kids are not motivated	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and you know eh you know i'll get through the day and um bring homework home and there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um just you know they they take a notion to do it they do and um that doesn't work either you know they have to have guidance and um they can't just have it at school and then come home and there's nothing	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know	0 1
uh-huh	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
okay you go first	0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
well yeah it it's it's pretty much what i was going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
um i grew up in new york and um the place or not new york city upstate new york	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
and i went to uh the city of rochester school district and s[o] a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
and that would result in some um could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior as some other schools had	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and uh it it so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
or they'll move farther away to get better schools so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of	1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
why is that	1 1 0
why is that	0 1 0
right	0
right	0
right	0
um-hum	0
yeah yeah yeah i know that that that was a big factor for me i ended up coming out of of the public school system very well you know with very good education	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
i ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice and i think the difference for me was that my parents were	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
you know they were definitely they were always there was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well i mean that's the way of course are you know	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh do you know anyone that uh has is in a nursing home or has ever been in one	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
well i'm trying to think my uh	0 0 1 0 1 1 0
uh wife's grandmother had alzheimer's and they were going to put her into a a nursing home and uh	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance i mean sh[e] she sort of went you know bananas and they couldn't couldn't deal with her	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
so i guess you need to uh know whether it's a you know no deposit no return kind of thing whether	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
right	1
right	1
my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that um there was a retirement hotel and then a uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it so for	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
um the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
and then um as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
um provide full-time care and um she didn't have to do anything anymore	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly and that's	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
some i don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
what the what the reason is but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
right	1
yeah if	1 0
if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
stay where you are and then you only go there as a last resort	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
or people send you there as a last resort	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
right	0
right	0
yeah i guess	0 0 1
right when you need it you need it i guess	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
right	1
yeah	1
sure	1
and you probably if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
right	1
i i've known quite a few people that have um gone to retirement communities i don't know if they have them back there but	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
here in california and in ariz[ona]	1 0 1 0 0 0
no but i my grandparents were looking into it before so i know what they've said	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
oh they thought it was too much of a bother	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
right	1
if they're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you're gonna have you know to put in there too because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
they wanted someplace they can go and have their meals and	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
have their own room	1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
well a lot of that's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help they need health care so they're already ill before they go	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
that's probably a large factor	1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
right right	1 1
that's my grandparents it was just so that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
so that was their thinking somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
and also so they could find someplace they enjoyed while they still had	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
choices to make so they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time i guess that's a problem too for people wait lists	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and all that um you can't always get in when you want to and of course you can't just sit around and wait	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah and the money is also another issue how you're gonna pay for it	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
at that stage of life you only have so much money left and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put in their savings i mean it is kind of fair but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so that's another problem	0 1 0 1
right right	1 1
so it's it's just so complicated anymore i think people outlive their savings and with medicine being the way it is you're extending life	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
it's just a shame that's the way it has to be i think the retirement home idea's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
because_1 uh like if your spouse died all of a sudden you be all alone it'd be nice to go someplace people similar to you and have friends	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
you wanna go first	0 0 1 1
okay um one of the things they talked about was uh	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
did we di[d] wha[t] do what do we think about a judge making the decision and i really don't agree with that	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
i think that the trial by jury is better	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
uh you know than e[ven] having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
y[ou] you know what i mean	0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
right	1
that's it	0 1
well i i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
i i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean i[f] if you go to a trial by jury	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's uh no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
you all these things i mean you know we've gone through this uh over and over again	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
and it can go on for ten twenty years i i think this is a little ridiculous	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
i i'm serious and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha[t] ha[ppen] that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
you know if someone is	1 0 0 1 0
well	1
well i know tha[t's] that's what i'm saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
in in that regard i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
and that they have to do something but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
you you know what i'm saying tha[t] we we don't have um well a lot of states don't have capital punishment	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
and um	1 0
i i think they should i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and um	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
you know all they they're caught dead to rights i i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
uh-huh	1
oh really	0 1
it uh	0 0
yeah	1
i know that the	1 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
an[d] i don't know uh wha[t] what would you do to change it to make it better	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
oh yeah i i i don't agree with that at all	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
imagine the guilt that person would have i mean it burned out is there's no possible way that you could um you know feel good about yourself if you had to do something like that day after day	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
no rea[lly] not really	1 1 0 1
well wou[ld] do you think people should have a trial if they're caught dead to rights like	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
well it's i i feel	0 0 1 1 0
no you can start	1 1 0 1
um-hum	1
right	1
right there's there th[is] thi[s] this topic is kind of moot um there there's no way we we couldn't survive in a sy[stem] in a in a juror syst[em] in a trial system without a jury um	1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
um every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
um	1
right	1
right they shouldn't allow an appeal	1 0 0 1 0 1
yep	1
um-hum	1
no that's right i work for a law firm i ought i	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
right	1
well plea bar[gaining] plea bargaining is a different story	1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
plea bargaining is something completely different that that actually prevents trials or or at least speeds them_1 up	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
right	1
right	1
hum	1
right	1
we do	1 0
right	1
right	1
when you're saying as as far as the appeal um procedure is concerned we just have the case i'm i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
um his fi[nal] his last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up	1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
so i mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
for cocaine possession but um	0 1 1 0 0
that was absurd there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
well	1
uh	0
the the only thing i can i was you know the the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of um i like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd there's no way that could work	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
um	1
but	1
oh exactly exactly	0 1 1
right	1
no one would want the job	1 0 0 1 0 1
um	1
and	1
you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah i i feel that everyone is everyone is um entitled to a trial by jury that that that right sh[ould]	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
well i mean were there witnesses	1 0 1 0 0 1
right	1
right that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
budgeting activity in our household i has is uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
uh kind of an informal kind of situation we we you know put actually what happens is uh is my check gets automatically deposited i don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore it just gets deposited	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and and and and and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in and you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them you see	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and so our our budgeting w[e] we really don't have a formal budgeting situation every time i've ever tried one it's uh i've just got wrapped up in minutia and uh i've just decided not to pursue it uh what what's your budget situation	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
you know well a[ctually] a[ctually] actually that kind of situation is just a wonderful for budgets isn't it	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
well my you know my my parents too you you you you were born in the in in the late thirties or early forties yeah	1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
hm	0
um-hum	0
well that's that's good	1 1 1 0
well we we buy what well we just got through buying a twenty five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and and we put twenty eight hundred dollars on the charge along with my trip to japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars and you know it's right i mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in but but we also	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
have zero uh interest being paid and we pay it off as as it goes	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah so we never really get that much over uh over extended	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
hm	0
yeah we're we're doing that we have you know uh th[is] this is our our our big uh we did redecorating two you know two new pieces in the re[frigerator] in the family room and new carpet i mean we just uh we've just spent	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
spending spending spending	1 1 1
bu[t] but but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've we've had two kids in college that have just uh graduated in the past year so we're you know we don't have that	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah it's uh it's about time that we did that but the the the terrible part about it i've looked at it all and it all looks still pretty good to me why why do we need to replace it but	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
but un[fortunately- but unfortunately my my my wife leigh feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate uh thing to to i mean that rug is thirteen years old why not replace it i mean	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i i say it might go for another thirteen but uh too late we'll never find that out	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
and	0
you know i i i don't spend that much money i just uh we we just sort of have had uh you know too many obligations to you know we sort of take care of the kids when they were in school and they they got through school and	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
that was the major you know decade of expenses you know	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
so we we feel as uh but as far as any formal budgeting uh you know i i we just apparently have	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
been very fortunate when we went to wanna go out to eat we go out to eat and we never really you know have to program money for that or make choices	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
you know but uh we don't have that uproarious a a lifestyle after all we're we	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
well actually uh	1 0 0
i've i've had a couple of different situations my current one has been the most successful uh at a certain point in life and my husband my ex-husband was an alcoholic and we got divorced back in the mid seventies and that left me with three teenagers	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it certainly is but at any rate what happened was that i i just absolutely put away all the credit cards i didn't rip them_1 up i didn't send them_1 back nothing i just put them away	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
because there was one that it was really handy to have if i absolutely had to have something i could go use it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
but uh mostly we just spent cash whatever we had and if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it but then as things improved you know once once i got them all through college	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh it came to the point where um my parents came through the depression i'm not sure how old you are	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
but my	0 1
late thirties yeah uh-huh and uh my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and that's kind of the way i was raised and so i'm not a very demanding person in in that aspect so for quite a period of time i just flat didn't spend any money now meanwhile i got had a building bank balance	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have i would have the cash to buy it right then and there	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
and not ever have to spend any money on interest	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
and that's that's the way i've operated ever since then it and you know if if something goes on sale and i don't have the money i still don't buy it	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh my	0 1
oh my	0 1
oh my	0 1
uh-huh and that's the way i do my credit cards now	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah i do almost all my purchasing on credit cards but it's the fact that i have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come i can pay them in full	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh my	0 1
i'm envious well i	0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
it's time for you to do these things then right	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
this is so funny that's wonderful but you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
you need somebody to help you spend it i mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
okay uh	1 0
so your you you i guess uh you're probably in the same uh same situation uh we're in we're kind of past having to provide child care our our kids are grown up we don't have any grandchildren yet but uh uh they're	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
uh one's twenty six and the other is uh twenty twenty one	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
so they're uh um	0 1 0 0
they're they're getting there you know there no no no prospects right away for anything to happen but uh	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
oh	0
um-hum	0
oh okay	1 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah that's hard we've	1 0 1 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
um	0

but you know there's only so much one person can do	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
she says it's so awful she said she'll never put her child in a in a in a [preca[re]-/preschool] in a p[reschool] in a preschool	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere but it's really it's really really very difficult and	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
well	1
when when uh the first uh ten years see first ten or twelve years i stayed home	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
and um and then after that i i went to work and um uh uh a couple times i just uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
um you know th[en] then i had one job and then that job ran out because_1 it's kind of a government seeded type job and then and then like about la[ter] later i	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i tried to get the baby to a babysitter [sup]posed to be good uh recommended person from the church and i knew her personally she have two kids of her own and everything but i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
i mean first of all uh you know her children were sick all the time so when my son stayed over there he got sick same thing same thing that the her kids had right	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and so um we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock then he she'd take my son and her daughter over t[o] to kindergarten	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
but sh[e] uh that day um i was saying now he he's sick and she goes well because_1 he has the same thing that all my kids have that's what he got	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know i goes well okay so it's not like he's gonna infect her kids but then what happened was is i said uh he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
well you know what that woman sent her sent him to kindergarten	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
she sent him to kindergarten as soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nursery i mean they put him in the nurse's office	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my babysitter called her and they said um	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
that he's sick well she wasn't home	0 0 1 1 1 0 1
i mean her all her kids are sick but she wasn't home right and her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
now why didn't he why didn't she keep him home with her no she didn't do that so it got to the point where he he's [sup]posed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and i had to leave work it was it was five o'clock in the evening and i found out he was still there at school	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and they were calling me and they says somebody's got to pick him up and i kept thinking that she was gonna get picked up	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
she was gonna pick him up because_1 she only lives in you know like two blocks away from the school i was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff and he had a hundred and four fever they couldn't	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh to give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything i was so furious i i quit that job and i stayed home for a while longer then i went and got a um a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah but uh i haven't had any good really very good experience with child care	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated body of law	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards so i i really don't think it th[ey] they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
well won't well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
and you know the other two guys sat in the car	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
and they didn't get beat up	0 1 0 0 0 1
you know rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur[poses] you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
and uh um	0 0 0
just like the burning and looting is self-destruct everybody says well this is the nineties and they're gonna rebuild and it'll be even better	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
hey what do you think you know some some black guy with capital is gonna come in and invest in that area	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
with everybody with that mindset they they're they're gonna that whole area is gonna be turned into residential ghetto you know and a[nd] you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
well e[verybody's] everybody's saying this is gonna be a new era we're gonna reexamine this thing	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
hey the bu[nch] the average person is gonna take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed they're a bunch of animals	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
you know how can you really deal with an environment where you're gonna lose everything	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
forty deaths i mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
and i'm just trying to determine you know how you address and how you weigh you know rodney getting getting the the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah and there's no other i i'm not su[re] exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because i'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
is it a looter that got shot by a store owner	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i you know no tears	0 1 0 0 1
yeah and and so i but i i suspect a number of them_1 you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
and and my reaction is i would've run over fifty people before rather than stop	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
and uh and th[ere] there would've been just uh nothing but carnage after after if i'd been at the wheel no one would've stopped me	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
right i'm inside the beltway	1 0 1 0 1
you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus and so and i say well wait a minute i'm inside the beltway and i don't think like that	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i'm a government employee	0 0 1 1
i'm with the fbi	1 0 0 1
yes an[d] and so um	1 0 0 0 0
uh and and the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because you know rick who is another government employee wanted a spee[ch] segments of my speech that uh were done a year ago and he wanted another collection a year later	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
and so this is my seventh call a year ago i did eleven calls	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and so that's that's why uh	0 1 1 1 0 0
uh tha[t's] that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique you know i have a unique situation here in that if i don't participate	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um i i don't think so possibly in the jury selection would be the only	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
just for example what we're seeing in california i guess	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah it makes you wonder um had the jury been a different group of people	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
what would've happened with that outcome um	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
and and the problems that that has come	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating um	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
just makes you wonder i guess whether or not they	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
um-hum	0
that's that	1 0
um-hum	0
no	1
um-hum	0
uh-huh	0
oh yes	1 0
uh	0
that's right	0 1
they're only gonna suffer	0 1 0 1
yeah they're only gonna suffer they they've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence um	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or uh don't live there or whatever	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
we all saw the same thing on the on the tape and um	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i know	0 1
that's really ridiculous	1 0 1
against forty other people being	1 1 0 1 0
those deaths	0 1
um-hum	0
or just a by[stander] an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what um	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
it uh or or beaten	0 0 0 0 1
right	1
that's that's exactly how i feel too i wouldn't have uh they wouldn't have stopped my car for any anything had i seen them coming but i was just wondering since you were you're in you're back east um	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and a little closer to the the bigger cities probably than we are in idaho here	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
oh	0
um-hum oh in what uh section of the government do you work	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh oh that's interesting	0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
oh	0
oh i see	0 0 1
um-hum	0
