i thought gosh i'd probably have nightmares for the next six months	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

well you're not a thirteen year old [laughter-okay] i don't know i saw it when i was a kid and i thought oh [laughter-man]	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
well i'll tell well i guess i i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh uh-huh	0 0
and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh really huh gosh	0 0 0 0
yeah he's a very good writer and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know it was	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
oh boy	0 0
yeah and of course i was i was living alone at the time and it was late at night and scary and [laughter-you] [laughter-know] you start hearing noises you know	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
[laughter-gosh] call the crisis line	0 0 0 0 0
yeah i bet	0 0 0
and there's rats in the attic you know	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh gosh	0 0
uh let's see there was a couple of others that are out and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and i can't remember	0 0 0 0
i saw one i thought was crummy with that new uh michael j fox movie the hard way where he plays a a actor that's uh like th[e] oh	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah i i didn't i didn't even like the previews on that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh i know it was well i ended up at the theater and there was didn't seem to be anything else on i wanted to see so i'll try that	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
but it wasn't worth anything i didn't care for that at all	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
no	0
i don't i don't much care for michael j fox anyway	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah well the last two i saw him in one of those back to the future part three deals and that was crummy also i didn't think that was any good so	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
so	0
i saw the original back to the future and then i i know i hardly ever go see a sequel	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
i mean i think i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh boy	0 0
uh two thousand and ten was far better	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah	0 0
two thousand and one was a good movie if you had read the book	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i hadn't read it and i couldn't figure what was going on half the time so	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah	0 0
and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you c[ould] say what is this	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
you know what's the significance of the apes you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh the book is really good i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again and that's one of them it's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
wow huh	0 0
it's it's so well written	0 0 0 0 0
huh huh well i have one i bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids otis and milo	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh you're right i haven't	0 0 0 0 0
oh that is that is the most precious movie it has w[as] to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life and it's all this it's the story of this little cat and dog and it's not like cutesy it's just uh it's just so realistic everything they do you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
huh oh those a	0 0 0 0
and it was a real dog and cat and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a real dog and cat	0 0 0 0 0
huh	0
and all the other animals they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised and then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up all over creation i don't know where in the world it is somewhere in china somewhere i think that it was filmed	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
huh	0
but uh it's just really an incredible thing	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
s[ounds] sounds sort of like the incredible journey	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it was pretty wild and of course the only sound is dudley moore narrates it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
but there's no you know nothing else to keep it going but it really keeps keeps me going i	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
huh	0
i i've seen it twice now	0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah th[at] that sounds a lot like a walt disney film	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
huh	0
sounds a lot a like a walt disney film	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah it was like the best of the walt disney ones walt disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion in the past few years	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
oh yeah not anymore i mean i i i was raised on walt disney films you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
old yeller uh big red	0 0 0 0 0

oh boy	0 0
hm	0
i mean that's that's something for a kid	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
that's pretty good	0 0 0
really	0
and that was something for greedy old me at christmas time i'll tell you	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
let's see what are some other ones i've seen lately i'm trying to remember i can't oh i just saw one on the video oh um have you seen the gods must be crazy part two	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
no	0
that is a riot	0 0 0 0

yeah the first one was really good but the second one is really good too i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
i was really surprised	0 0 0 0
yeah i didn't much care for the first one maybe that's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
no i thought it was funny but that's my sense of humor i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
well i i'll have to go get that one i guess	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
it's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore and i'm just i guess i'm just middle america or something i just go to be entertained and and not really interested in some of the like the terminator or some of the schwarzenegger stuff i	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah it's it's yeah	0 0 0 0

i just can't believe it it's like rocky films i i haven't seen a one i	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
[laughter-yeah] yeah yeah i've never seen any of those	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i can't stand stallone	0 0 0 1
yeah i can't either he seems so macho i just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah and i i was afraid that rambo was going to do the same thing that rocky was going to do you know go into fourteen hundred episodes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

yeah	0
now i don't i hardly ever watch tv if i ever get the hankering to see something i've got i don't know maybe about thirty or forty movies and i just	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah when they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah i don't even rent them you know i	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
that's	0
i i figure if i find a movie i like i'll buy it because_1 i just watch them over and over again	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's like my husband does that he can watch them over and over and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i	0 0
and i'm there's very few i would want to see that many times so he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh excalibur	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah that was a good one i haven't seen that one in a long time	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i i loved that film um it's just so well done	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and i lived over in england for four years	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh boy	0 0
that was the first place i ever saw it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and it was just gosh it was so good	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
oh huh	0 0
it was it was filmed in ireland	1 0 0 0 0 0 1
huh	0
and they got pretty scenery in ireland	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i bet	0 0 0
yeah it's nice	0 0 0
gosh	0
and i i've been down to the south of england where supposedly king arthur's castle was	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh boy so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it was yeah it was unimpressive to look at i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium house yeah it wasn't no	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
oh really well when i was in england years ago and i went to to like shakespeare's and you know stratford-on-avon and all that	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
oh yeah	0 0
and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it because it was so short the	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
the ceilings were so short but	0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
but yeah	0 0
yeah there's some nice stuff over there to see	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
i i spent four years traveling around and didn't see you know hardly anything i just	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh boy	0 0
i need to go over there and stay about twenty years so i can just travel go around all the places	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
stonehenge of course you know every everybody makes the obligatory trip to stonehenge	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah	0 0
okay big deal here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field okay it's boring	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
did you see any movies over there	0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i remember i went to see don quixote over there when it came out it came out right around the time with sophia loren and that was a riot to see that	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
you know something i come to think of it i don't think i went to the movies one time	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah because_1 when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie but	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
i uh where i lived uh it was a little town called newmarket about seventy miles north of london and	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
huh	0
oh boy	0 0
and there was another town called barry saint edmunds about twenty miles away from us	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and they had a little uh theater company there and we use to go go out to that about once a week	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh boy	0 0
yeah a really nice place you know amateurs but really quite good	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
uh that that was interesting course used to go to london quite a lot and see shows down there	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
that sounds great	0 0 0
yeah	0
uh but other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies you know	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
never show any anyway anything that i ever wanted i rented a lot of videos	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
because_1 the closest movie theater was barry saint edmunds and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh boy	0 0
probably some of them did	0 0 0 0 0
a lot of a lot of people did but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
but it would have to be a good show	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore because	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by and	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah i i use they they they have all these neat phrases you know you know the like critically acclaimed	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
that's what they say when the thing hasn't won any award	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh i see	0 0 0
you know they can't	0 0 0 0
it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're you know if you're two miles away from water	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah yeah	0 0
yeah from love canal	0 0 0 0
water view	0 0
waterfront property here at love canal you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that's wh[at] i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh well what would you say your opinion is on gun control	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i don't know i've i've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to uh the radio and and watch tv about the different uh things that are happening i uh i'm against it but on the same token um i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
well	1
so i i have a rifle in the house um the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it but uh i bought it for target practicing and uh and also because i wanted a weapon uh how do you feel about it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
well i think uh down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
hm	0
and i think they need that uh now i do have a i have a pistol it's a little twenty two and i have a twenty two or a twelve gauge shotgun	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and you know i do like to have my guns	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh i don't know if i'll ever use it you know and like you my bullets to my little pistol's probably uh about three years old uh my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
but uh i like to have them_1 where handy	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well up uh up in new england where i'm from uh y[ou] you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammu[n]it[ion] amm[unition] ammunition and i thought that was really good and i think it they uh takes	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
takes two weeks for that system to process um your request for uh not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition you have to get a p[ermit] permit from the police station in your local area to do that	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
i've never heard of anything like that	0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah um	0 0
that would be nice but a[nd] you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i i i agree i	0 0 0 0 0
i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh to to stop the impulse buyer from um buying it quickly and and um maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it but	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
but if someone's really determined to to pick up a firearm uh you can pick it up anyplace and	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and you can get them really cheap	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i know i i uh th[e] i had a waiting period on my pistol because_1 i was down in uh tennessee and uh they had a waiting period and	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
and uh we bought it there and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0
how long was the waiting period out there	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
about_1 nine days	0 0 0
ah that wasn't too too bad	0 0 0 0 0 0
no no	0 0
because i[f] if you're gonna go buy something um of of that nature i think you've you're gonna have some idea as to what you're gonna do with it you're not gonna react that quickly in other words you know you [d]on't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah somebody want do th[at] i i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah i do too uh because [laughter-it] doesn't make any difference uh uh whether it's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose they both do the same kind of job	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh yeah i suppose i'd never got shot with either one but i don't know um i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a [laughter-shotgun]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
a shotgun's got too much of a spread or at least ours does uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
uh it you know you have a little uh thing on the bo[ttom] bottom of th[e] on top of the barrel where you a[s] you turn it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
you can make it either tight or [laughter-as] loose as loose can get	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh	0
and the spread changes	0 0 0 0
uh i've got a a manual singled shot and i guess it doesn't have any any automatic features to it the further away i get the the uh wider the shot gets from the target	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets it's got a hell of a kick to it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah my husband had a uh a police gun at one time and i shot that thing one time almost knocked me down	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
it was just a little i don['t] i forget i think it was a three fifty seven i'm not sure	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
do you belong to a gun club or you uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
he belonged to one awhile back uh since we mo[ved] we've only been here in texas for about a year	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
uh we can't even find a place to shoot just for target practice	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
no kidding	0 0
i'd love to get used to that shotgun we traded his pistol for that shotgun	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
huh well the the um uh clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive but uh it's well worth it you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and so[me] targets and have uh competition um i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire uh there's an annual membership fee uh that's that's fairly high plus there's initi[ation] initiation fee that you have to pay as a first time uh uh member	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars just to join the club plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
yeah well that's what uh my husband wh[en] when he was in it gun club when they's done that it you know he went mostly just to um shoot at paper targets	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
i think the the gun clubs serve a useful purpose in fact i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
that's a good i've never thought of that	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
that's a good point	0 0 0 1
and you know it it even a[fter] after you wait your nine days if you don't know how to hand[le] it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive and you give him a license because he waited nine days	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah that and yeah	0 0 0 0
he could he could not only um uh shoot himself he could he could uh mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
and well we uh we was living on a navy base down in memphis and uh this one guy decided to play uh lonesome cowboy or something and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
wow he was fortunate he [laughter-could] [laughter-he] [laughter-could] [laughter-of] [laughter-hit] [laughter-something] [laughter-else]	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
well he went tumbling down the steps along with uh shooting his foot almost off he broke his leg and a collar bone and couple of other things i'm sure being mister cowboy i	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
wow	0
i can't remember what the na[me] term was going around it was about four to five years ago	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
but naw th[e] i guess that would be a good idea	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
about_1 uh private citizens selling uh weapons like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me huh how do you feel about that do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the um buyer and the seller and or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh because you own it	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh that's a hard one because_1 we did that but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it i'll uh you know the person who sells the gun ought to protect themself because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are gonna come to you	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah but is[n't] isn't there a way to um to deregister yourself after you register a gun	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
ah	0
i have no idea i've only had one gun and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
because i have	0 0 0
and i've kept it you know uh the one gun that was in my name	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah is it registered	0 0 0 0
yeah i	0 0
the um the rifle that i've got is not registered	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and um i don't know why i never registered it but the uh	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don't think you have to register a shotgun	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
um i'd i'd i think it's it's voluntary the um the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well see uh my husband has a thing if they go to uh regulating uh all right uh banning guns o[f] pri[vate] private pri[vate] private ci[tizens] citizens	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
yeah	0
this my kid is jumping on me i can't hardly talk	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
my husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i guess that could happen it's just like the uh the social security system once they uh they gave everybody a number and now they're making you um uh get one at at birth	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and once they have your number they have you know your identification and	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and if you try to to do anything um like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
and everything about you	0 0 0 0
and that's true	0 0 0
uh i bu[t] you know they know it from how much money you make a week to uh probably your uh my kid is banging i was seeing what they was banging on uh i've lost my train of thought i'm sorry	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
that's all right yeah you were talking about uh um fed[eral] what the federal government knows about people	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh the social	0 0 0
yeah they pr[obably] they probably know everything from half the time wh[at] ho[w] what time you go to the bathroom	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
they probably do	0 0 0
no that's that's a little bits extreme but they could know anything and everything about you and uh i'd like to have my gun if they go to banning banning them_1 i'd lose my gun but we wouldn't lose our pis[tol] or ou[r] shotgun	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
and uh we're wanting to get a couple more that no one knows about	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
but i don't i don't uh	0 0 0 0 0 0
do you find it difficult picking up uh guns that that are not registered	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
naw	0
no i don't either i can i can buy some uh today if i wanted to just you know put up the money	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah w[ell]	0 0
yes well you can look in the uh the we got the thing down here called a shopper	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
it's a a who a it's a it's a bargain thing uh you go and everyb[ody] you know i always see guns in there five to seven guns a day	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
it comes out every tuesday	0 0 0 0 1
and there's there's no waiting period on that	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
naw [laughter-none] whatsoever	0 0 0
you ca[n] call w[e] we sold a refrigerator through it and it took us all of twelve hours	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
you sell the refrigerator	0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
you know and i'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
hm yeah i think the federal government is um is really far away from uh um control i i don't believe in um should i shouldn't probably say control i mean regulation control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have b[ut] um but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah well i'll agree with you there they do have too much control over us already	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money so i can't complain too much	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i guess so i don't know they're	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay so wh[at] now what are your opinions on recycling	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i've heard that too	1 0 0 0 1
and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my pap[er] i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	1
and i can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them_1 and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait [un]til i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them_1	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	1
and uh th[at's] i can't remember where i went to take them_1 but they wou[ldn't] they wouldn't take them_1	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
oh i know	0 0 1
glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
there's no really recycling facilities	0 0 0 0 1
no we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i think that's a good idea	0 0 0 0 0 1
and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
besides well like a law or whatever and that's how it is in new york or isn't it	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
i think so it's just because they have to you know	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	1
you get ticketed if you don't do it right	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's a it's trouble for me to do what i do i	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
i mean i am willing to do it but	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
plus you have to have a place to store all of it and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah	1
and see i live in an apartment	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in iowa the state i'm from uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	1
everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
and then you take it back to the store and you get it back	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah that's true	0 1 0
it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian i don't know if you've tried it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i've seen them_1	1 0 1 0
and they have on the ba[ck] it's five cents okay it's still five cents	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	1
and it even shows the states that	0 0 0 0 0 1 0
that take them_1 back	0 0 0 1
yeah well wh[at] some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
is texas one of them_1	0 0 1 0 0
texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them_1 away cause there is no place to take glass	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at jc penney at their corporate headquarters	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and we have a paper recycling program that's um company wide and i do the recycling for that	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
do they save like the paper the[y] they use like the office paper	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
good because_1 there is a lot of waste there isn't there	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah i know there's a lot of computer paper though that you can't use	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
right	1
right	1
but um we use to have uh i mean i i don't even remember how much money that they've um m[ean] i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program they've donated it to charities	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
right	1
i mean they've made a substantial amount of money from it	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with downy because they were first	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
you know i want them to have my business and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
well now you see some of this stuff and you're and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why didn't you think of that before	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah and i think it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah that's true	1 0 1
and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
and i don't know it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
then that's pollution	0 0 1
i know amway i only use a couple things form amway that it says this is burnable material well that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah and then just like the glass bottles th[at] that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in texas	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
and there's no place i can take glass to	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
so i still throw away a lot of glass	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
truly sad	0 1
yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plas[tic]	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh being a former drug user i uh i'd i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
whoa	1
uh-huh	0
uh because i know that uh in using drugs i was not a good employee	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
and so i can see from the company's standpoint that there uh whenever you are an employee of the company you are using it's assets and uh a[nd] bu[t] you're also under their liability under the workmen's comp	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
uh on my job we had a lot of workmen's comp cases and uh i work for a tire company modern tire	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
where do you work	0 0 0 1
oh	1
and uh it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our uh injuries occur	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and what we do is we'll have a drug test i[f] if an if a a boy or a man uh has an accident then he's automatically uh given a drug test	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
right do they do it like you know within hours of the accident or is it	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yes when he goes to the doctor the first time	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and so that kind of uh i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
now we've let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i don't know how tec would handle it they haven't pursued it you know	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
uh if there's some uh problem i know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines and he went to a a separate drug testing firm and	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
and they showed it negative	0 1 1 0 1
huh	1
so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
yeah i think that's probably true too that's that's that's sort of scary	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh really and then i also had a friend who was uh just around some people that were smoking cocaine	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
and he tested positive on cocaine now then you always wonder well is he just saying that	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
[laughter-yeah] yeah really really	1 1 1 1
yeah	0
yeah that's that's a bad situation i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that i	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
um-hum	0
yeah	0
i think they should	0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
i'm a ti employee and and and uh i'm i'm really gung ho for it in	0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
in fact i you know some of the places now um like ibm don't allow even smoking you know in the in the plant	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
right	1
we we have designated smoking areas	1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
but um i work in sort of a building that's that's not really it well it's on the campus of the ti facility but it's a little bit you know separated we lease the building and it's m[ainly] it's a factory environment	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and uh they they have designated smoking but it's just wide open it's not ventilated properly and	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
and i think that's bad but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way i think it's a it's a definite i think it's essential	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
yeah because you're endangering everybody's lives if you've if it's something like that	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
in fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and uh i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know they	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
they never they never called me they never you know then finally the day we declared war was my time	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
[laughter-you're] kidding	1 1
[laughter-no] and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think and i told him he's obviously in a high risk group	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the executives right	0 1 1
right right and of course you know they they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the executives	0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah wouldn't that be awful if you were if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
which i thought was [laughter-interesting]	0 0 0 1 1
oh man yeah	0 1 1
ooh yeah	1 1
i can't believe i'd was so brazen before i'm like i say i'm a former drug user but	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
but uh i i well uh i accepted christ as my lord and savior and so i don't use drugs any more	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines	0 1 1 0 1
wow	1
um yes [laughter-uh-huh]	0 1 0
and all on the job too	0 1 1 0 1 1
really	1
you know it had gotten that bad	0 1 0 0 0 0 1
well it's really lucky that you got away from that	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
really	1
cause that's really downward spiral	0 1 1 0 1
it's it's life is so much more enjoyable	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
yeah yeah that's that's it	1 1 1 0 1
i mean you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah just life in general	1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh that's right	0 0 1
yeah well i'm well i'm definitely for it	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
plus you know you you want to think that that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share but that are not endangering your life in	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's right	0 1
in some cases like	0 0 1 1
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
like uh my husband uh several years back worked for motorola	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and they had you know i mean it was a chemical handling type	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
oh goodness	0 1
yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
yeah	1
like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh my gosh	0 0 1
you know that's really that's really frightening so	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know on on a on a greater frequency than than maybe just you know the paper pushers like like i am	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
right	1
i would think they would be	0 0 0 0 1 0
well you well you'd think so but uh	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
but they weren't	1 0 1
i don't know if they do it [un]til yet	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
isn't that awful	0 0 1
because when he was at course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at ti i	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh uh-huh	1 0
i forgot what i guess it was like eighty four eighty five something like that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
huh	0
so that's scary	1 0 1
yeah that's reminds me of uh i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
oh lord	1 1
oh	1
and i just you know went oh [laughter-where]	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
[laughter-yeah] yeah should we move	1 0 0 0 1
let me move as far away as possible	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
ooh	1
yeah	1
that's awful	0 1
but i'm proud though that that um you know i grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	1
but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah	1
and they really have a good campaign for the young people you know	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
they know it's not smart so so i guess it was just a generational thing	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah peer group is the other way now instead of	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
that's right and that's good	0 1 0 1 1
uh-huh that's	0 1
that's the best way to stop it	0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah that it really is	1 1 0 1 0
yeah well i think we did it	1 1 0 0 0 1 0
[laughter-okay] well	1 0
it's good talking to you	0 0 0 0 1
well i enjoyed talking talking to you cathy	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah bye-bye	1 1
i don't know what the the last thing i've done far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff i haven't gotten really involved in anything uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an oldsmobile	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah i had a similar thing that i've worked on cars ever since i was uh a kid and that was some time ago but i've gotten to the point where uh the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that uh oh most of the cars i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah i know what you mean	0 0 0 0 0 0
so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or or fuel injected so	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah they're fuel injected and so there's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
no there's no way somebody once said uh i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh yeah yeah basically that's it	0 0 0 0 0 0
you know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh the guys average guys can't really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i've got uh an eighty four chevy van that's uh a one ton van with a camper conversion on it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
it's got the the the good old three fifty standard engine in it	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
absolutely	0
regular gas engine and that engine i understand i can i can actually work on that engine	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah i used to have uh chevy van it was a short van that had the the three fifty in it	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
uh-hum	0
and basically it it was a motor and you didn't have all the other junk around it	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	0
and you could get to it to work on it	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah i had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
yeah the hardest part about uh water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
well that's true that you're right you know by the time you've finally got down to it i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
a few years ago i had an oldsmobile diesel and uh the uh it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it and uh i bought it when we were living in lubbock when i came back here i brought the car back here and uh i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah yeah	0 0 0
and uh the injector pump went bad so i found an outfit down here to rebuild it and uh i reinstalled that and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i don't think i'd know where to start with a diesel	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh well if you know diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
well that's true	0 0 0
and uh	0 0
i think the onl[y] closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop uh when i was in high school and uh we used to overhaul farm tractors basically	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
and they were nearly all all diesel but as far as cars i've never never been involved with them	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm tractors you know what are about the size of your thumb and the	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
well ye[ah] yeah and you ca[n] you can get to them	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah you can get to them and the ones in in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
well i	0 0
i've had a lot of good service out of that car but uh uh i finally gave it to my son and he drove it literally into the ground [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
he was out at tech and he he finished it off	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
i'm i guess you're right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why one of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at i su[re] i don't know if it's still uh limited like it was i don't notice it probably because i don't	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
what the availability	0 0 0
huh	0
you mean the diesel availability	0 0 0 0 0
yeah i don't i don't notice but maybe because i'm not looking for it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah well i'd bought uh a gmc diesel pickup and uh loved that thing you know i really liked it but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really needed and	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
yeah	0
and it was the van that i needed then to buying the you know traded it in on the chevy van but uh i sure enjoyed it	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
but you you got the you got the three fifty in the van	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah the three fifty regular gas engine	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah that's what i like because they've got plenty of power and uh if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
i'm convinced that uh detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah well	0 0
i'm convinced that the small v eight like the the mustang's original two eighty nine or some of the chevy two eighty threes were good little v eight engines that were not gas guzzlers but	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
but they had enough power to pull all this weight	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and the four cylinders just don't have it	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
think that little the little chevy v eight when it started out in sixty in fifty five i think was two sixty five something like that	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
little you know not a hold lot more than the than the six cylinder that i think was like about for about two thirty five or something but uh they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred small block four hundred that was uh the same block you know just just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i think those g[uys] those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well that was uh that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah	1 0
the two little cars i've got now bought a mitsubishi mirage here a couple years ago and and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah that's kind of like	0 0 0 0 0 1
the the first well my first car was a fifty six mustang and uh over the years uh all i had a uh dodge pickup several years ago and uh i can't remember the size of the engine it was a three o seven or something like that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
but uh i remember working on those cars you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
now you open the hood and it's scary	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the friend of ours over here he's got uh sixty five or sixty six mustang with the six cylinder	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and uh i was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
it's amazing	0 0
well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
my dad's got a new um i guess it's an eighty nine or ninety uh chrysler something or other it's one those transverse mounted v sixes front wheel drive	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah	0 0
and uh he was showing it to me and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean and you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front and i said well where are the other three	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and he had never really thought about it	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
and he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off yeah it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the three fifty with all the you know like well actually i guess here within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it the three o five was that that v eight that they put in the the three quarter and and half ton van and	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	0
and it had all the air pump and uh uh i don't know all that all that stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	0
yeah the antismog pumps	0 0 0 0
and all the antismog stuff and uh boy that was uh really a mess back under there under the in that van	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
and all that stuff loads the motor down	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
so it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things but that's one good thing i've got a uh eight ninety uh chevy blazer now and it's got one uh belt on it a serpentine belt	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh it's that one that's about uh what an inch and a half wide got	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
got a bunch of groves in it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having i've got an an olds tornado that i think's got six belts on the sucker	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and uh i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck you know when one of them breaks it's not the outside one it's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh man	0 0
it's it's the it's usually that power steering belt or something that's way back in there	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
you bet everything else's got to come off first	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
everything's got to come off	0 0 0 0 1
well it's a pleasure meeting you	1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah and we'll uh how many times have you done this now is this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh i've got uh five stickers here from ti so i guess i've done probably uh i'd say seven or eight of them	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah i hadn't uh hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last uh this is the first one in a week or so	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so i don't know if if it's tapering off or or what	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
if it's winding down or what	0 0 0 0 0 1
i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting uh answers	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
finding a taker	0 0 0
so it sounds it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so people or either not or maybe they're burned out or	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
well	0
anyway let you go thanks for talking	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay all righty bye-bye	0 0 0 0
okay what you mean my voice	0 0 0 0 1 1
yes	0
oh no i am from kentucky originally	0 1 0 1 0 1 1
oh well	0 1
so	0
i heard that the topic today was gardening and lawn care	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
ooh	0
i know we're about to hit it here a few minutes i figured i c[ould] make this call and get it over with we are going to mow and trim and edge	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh	0
[tha]t's all we have been doing all weekend	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
you know what it seems like we are doing it here forever we bought a a large house that was completely unlandscaped i mean it it was pro[bably] probably was up to your shoulder in in thistles that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
that was all that was there and	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and we hired a professional landscaper to do it and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
and so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year probably through the fall too and uh rip up rip out all the rest of these [laughter-junipers] or anything that requires uh more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
uh how many kids do you have	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
just two	0 0
okay	0
but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
what year i mean how old are they	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
four and five	0 0 0
four and five goodness	0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
i've got a four year ol[d] a four year old and a four month old and an eight year old stepdaughter	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh well i have a twenty six year old stepson	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and i don't know if that counts	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well you do not have to tend to [laughter-him]	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i did for many years so	0 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh you did okay it is over with	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
he is gone	0 0 0
yeah it is over with	0 0 0 0 0
but back to gardening are you one of these uh howard garrett organic enthusiasts or a neil sperry nuke the lawn [laughter-with] chemicals	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
if i can just nuke it i'd do it but i do not i just it is like oh i'll get out there and pull my weeds i do not have a real big front yard but i do have half of it is a flower bed just about all by the porch	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
because_1 the porch is pretty big i live in town but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts i do not like it and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff and i just plowed through the whole nine yards got up everything there was some plants that are just spring bloomers	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
and i the lea[f] when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
so i just broke all them off it was a hyacinth have you ever seen those	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh yes	0 0
oh they are pretty in the spring but the leaves i do not like them_1 you know once	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
all right now are you sure they are hyacinths because that is a bulb	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
yeah it is a bulb	0 0 0 0 0
well you should of just ripped the whole thing out	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
no because_1 i do like the i like the plant in the spring i love those pink flowers they are just pretty so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down because_1 i want them to come back up next year	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
have you had is this the first year they have been up	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
well let me tell you they do not come back very well at all maybe they will if up further north but down and you are not that much further north i have probably planted oh around here um maybe six hundred bulbs	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
of hyacinths	0 1
no i have probably have done hyacinths but	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh of everything	0 0 0
but i have just learned wi[th] with doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming because_1 they do not take the heat here and if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh they will	0 0 0
yep	0
hum	0
about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area is the uh uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
okay now i have got some daffodils and w[e] everybody down here calls these flags uh the irises i guess um	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

yep well the you know nursery men will se[ll] will sell you things here and they are they are kind of in a labor of love the other thing to do if you re[ally] really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

okay	0
and they make uh oh about a foot high plant and they send out this this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it but that purple ball	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay do you vote regular	0 0 0 0 0
yeah i do i try and vote in every single election	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
every one	1 0
but uh that's just since in the past say about six years before that i really didn't pay any attention at all	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well see that's me i've never paid any attention to voting	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh you haven't	0 0 0
hum-um	0
yeah i didn't use to but now i really because_1 i get so angry about what goes on and then i feel like i can't really complain too much unless	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
unless you have something to do with it	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
right	0
but the problem is that i am very liberal politically and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i [laughter-vote] [laughter-for]	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh liberal by what do you mean by liberal um	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
liberal politically i'm you know like pretty left wing demo[crat] democrat so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well see i don't know anything about politics	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh you don't	0 0 0
uh what's the main what's the main difference between republicans and democrats	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay well there's a lot of them_1 um [de]pends on what issue you're talking about but democrats are on a lot of issues are more liberal than republicans and well it used to be it's kind of hard to say now especially after desert storm but um i think back in the eigh[ties] times when uh my political opinions were being formed like in viet[nam] during the vietnam war and stuff the republicans were more you know what they called hawks which is more like aggressive in war and more pro-war and pro-aggression and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
and um the democrats were the doves they were more for peace and i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore i think you know the issues are	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay and you vote for the democrats or	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
usually	0
yeah and democrats usually are su[pportive] more supportive of public assistance programs and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
and and programs to um th[e] the big republican thing is that they don't they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
and so they're more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people or more m[ore] uh they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
huh okay	0 0
so so have you ever voted at all	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

hum-um	0
how old are you	0 0 0 0
i'm twenty six	0 0 0
oh gosh	0 0
i know i sh[ould] i	0 0 0 0 0
well	0
well i don't know mu[ch] that much about it i	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
i don't keep up on it and i don't feel like i ha[ve] have enough knowledge on it to even you know to pick the right person	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yep	0
yeah well uh-huh	0 0 0
so that's what they need well it uh they said something to improve voting	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
if they could make it more oh easier to find out you know what's going on do you know what i mean	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah	0 0
like uh like to me i don't i didn't know what would have been wrong with i can't even remember who ran for president against bush i think it was uh that woman	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
du[kakis]	0
wasn't it a woman	0 0 0 0
no it was dukakis from massachusetts	0 0 0 1 0 1
dukakis	0
okay didn't he have a woman or wasn't or was that reagan there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while ferraro	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh yeah that was	1 0 0 0
ferraro	0
yeah ferraro that was a while ago that was a couple elections ago yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
[laughter-okay]	0
yeah that's okay	0 0 0
well well that's what i mean like i didn't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
you know i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so what do you think about uh what do you think about what you see on tv about them_1 like in the news or on the ads do you kind of just	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
okay i don't remember anything about dukakis	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
you don't	0 0
but well they're all saying that they're going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	0 0
that's what i mean if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
i don't know like you know in school they didn't teach you about demo[crats] uh the government not really	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
right	0
you didn't get any government classes	0 0 0 0 0 1
hum-um	0
yeah it's really hard too because before they used to have um a lot of it seems like the stuff that they put out now it i mean i doesn't just seem like it i know for a fact that the any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material well what do you believe in what do you believe in they don't take any stands on anything they kind of say well what do you want me to believe	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i'm not sure they're yeah i know how they do it it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
it like i[t] with the abortion issues and stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum yeah they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and things like that so that's kind of how i judge there's a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control or let me see i try to look at what if some of the newspaper articles or the i don't trust tv as much but newspaper articles can show wheth[er] how they voted in the past and but you get you know it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
right	0
it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right and like i said most of the poli[ticians] the politicians i'm the also the politicians put out what makes them_1 look good anyway	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum yeah yeah	0 0 0
and everybody's got you know stuff they don't want known	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
right everybody's got a secret so	0 0 0 0 1 0
well anyway i'm sorry i didn't i didn't have much knowledge	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
well that's okay do you think do you think um	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don't even remember this being on there	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i mean what would it take like that this is really good actually tha[t] for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted i mean what kind of	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
incentive	0
how would it how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that that you would know more about it like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library or	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i guess that would be good now i'm sure they've got it at the library you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
i mean if i get to the library i've got two babies so i don't yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
oh do you yeah that'll tie you down a little bit	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
but i i don't know	0 0 0 0 0
or do you just not do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote or	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
um well a lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes you know if	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
if since you're what democrat th[en] then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote democrat right	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum yeah	0 0
right	0
um-hum	0
i mean	0 0
well not in my [laughter-family]	0 0 0 0 0
no	0
we're kind of really independent	0 1 0 0 1
all split	0 0
but a lot of families do that i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	0
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved golly	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i lie hm	0 0 0
but well	0 0
i don't know if i did understand politics i probably would vote more	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but like i said if i voted for bush or like when uh gary hart was running a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking not	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
hart	0
uh-huh	0
not that i think he was good looking but he was young	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
and then i didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but because it was he had an affair	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah	0 0
and it just threw him out of the whole running	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and a lot of people go by their uh personal life when they vote and	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum yeah	0 0
which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work but i'm sure there's a lot of people that have had	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
i think everybody does it just depends on how well you can hide it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
you know and i that's very true i i think that doesn't really have that much to do with um unless they've done something really horrible you know or something real abnormal	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
well	0
criminal or something like that's different but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah right	0 0
but if him and his wife weren't getting along i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
but otherwise	0 0
um-hum	0
i mean what is what effect does that have on him running for president do you know what i mean	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah	0 0
it's all so secretive see we really don't see the true person anyway	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
that's right	0 0
i think that's that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country's being run is that um the the election the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that you know that really don't have anything to do with how well they do the job	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	0
but see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no and if they don't say yes or no then maybe somebody'll vote for them_1 that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side do you know what i'm saying so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	0
so they just try and make it a personal thing i mean if you remember any of the tv commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had uh pictures of bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and even from reagan it was all just like looks like a mcdonald's commercial you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
that's [laughter-about] what it looked like	0 0 0 0 1 0
well what did you think of reagan as a president	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i just thought he was really inept i don't think he did anything at all he they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
do you think he won from carter because of the um the hostages that were held at that time	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
well i think that was part of it i think there's a lot of the the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff people	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
people just had a picture of carter as not being real capable but he actually all right [laughter-this] i thought he was great	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i thought carter was good too and that was yeah	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
did you i always liked him i thought he was great at the time and i i just couldn't get over the fact that reagan beat him i you know that i just couldn't believe that he got voted out	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
but i think i wasn't well let's see that's been about ten years ago right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum yeah	0 0
okay so i was only fifteen or sixteen but i remember carter and i liked him	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you did have you heard stuff about him lately do you know what he's doing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
no i sure don't	0 0 0 0
well he is just he is really active still politically he's been overseas you remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the middle ea[st] for pe[ople]	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
anyway what are your what are your first comments on that subject	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh my first comments on the budget i would say there has	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
what would you start cutting f[irst] what would be the first thing you'd cut defense	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
surprisingly no i would i would cut the prison systems and let them self-support	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
mean private enterprise	1 0 1
hm	1
have private enter[prise] enterprise do it	0 0 1 1 1 0
you mean the prisons	1 1 1 1
uh-huh they're already talking about it i mean they're talking about um having it uh as a you know business uh to uh you know to so the you know the government doesn't have to deal with it	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
i hadn't heard that	0 0 1 0
but uh yeah because i think it's all funded either state or federally funded so or uh obvious[ly] so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
right	1
so but um but see they're they don't have enough um um you know there's there's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
but to me well	1 0 1 0
they think they need to maybe have uh you know private you know business private enterprise come in so	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like um the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work rather than sitting there	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum	1
it's the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the united states i feel the same way uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	1
so it's self defen[se] you know self-defense on that point um as far as my defense budget uh they're cutting it back now what twenty five percent i wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
but again i'd like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today so i'm lost on that one i would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems and to come up with something a little better than what we've got	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum yeah its tough to to say what um you know what uh as far as this that good or bad or what but uh i was just talking to somebody else and all those european countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that they so uh	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
well not so much pay i'm not trying to see the government put out any more	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
no yeah i know what you are saying but i'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here it you know it's just up to high school	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah but see we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up you know why	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
hum-um	1
why not an apprentice out to a a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or you know just a technician you can learn on the job which of course again which m[ean] would mean again our	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	1
our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
but that would come down	0 0 1 0 0
i think the pro[gram] you know that's one reason uh you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh they're not willing to you know to put that you know the training for only a certain amount so	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
so um it's you know as far as the technical side but uh even like one one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff i mean they they're trying to get more people into that field but they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work you know for a lawyer as a paralegal	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum well yeah i i'm well ye[ah] i you know i'm assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously there's uh uh you know there's a lot to learn uh after that but but uh that's true i'm i'm sure there's a lot of um you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh let me change my channel i've got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up is that better	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yes	1
okay	1
wow	1
an[d] yeah it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something so we had some interference so i changed that	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah it sounded you were calling from around the world [laughter-somewhere]	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
anyway so um	1 1 0
we[ll]	1
but uh you know i think uh they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people you know stuff like that programs like that you know i	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
um-hum	1
i don't know you know what kind of options they've got	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well that's something about what germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school they're	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
they're they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around because they don't have any education	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	1
i don't mean college and i'm for college but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned they've had it	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only it was either sixty percent or forty percent go to college and then out of that percentage only so many can get their degree	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	1
so i thought that was interesting but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah but there's a lot of them out there that haven't	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah well i ju[st] you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area and	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
that's	1
and yeah so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on and they go to college etcetera	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
well it seems to me that kids that a[re] get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more they'll make a lo[t] happier life for themselves	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
well as as far as the you know the deficit that's a whole nother uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money or goo[ds] you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know and um you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours but um it's just that uh they're in i think you're you're going to find that just because the united states you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh uh the mon[ey] you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh sell products abroad as much as we bring in so	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldn't even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the the output from the united states was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
hum-um	1
what kind of car do you drive now	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
i drive a honda prelude and	1 0 1 0 1 1
do you i drive a honda accord	1 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh [laughter-yeah]	1 0
[laughter-yeah]	1
i bought mine a year ago so i'm not buying a car any time [laughter-soon]	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah me either i just bought mine uh it'll be a year in august	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
i love it though i love hondas	0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it	1 1
i think i found my car	0 0 0 1 0 1
well i i like where all the controls are they're they're in good spots and	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
right	1
and i i have an automatic i can't drive a standard	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh really i	0 1 0
yeah	1
i have a standard	0 0 0 1
but um i it's and it's supposedly real reliable the only thing i've ever heard about hondas is that the breaks go out first	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh really	0 1
yeah	1
i hadn't heard that	0 0 0 1
yeah	0
what did you have before you bought that	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i had a buick regal	0 0 0 0 1
did you	1 0
yeah	0
i had uh mazda rx seven before that and that was the worse car i've ever driven in my life	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
the buick was was great it was nine years old and and it was still going strong and	1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
really	1
the only problems i had had with it in nine years that i owned it i had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
really	1
and that was the only major problem that i had i mean i had little piddly things like i had to replace the muffler and	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and i had replaced the tires and uh seems like it had a radiator leak once but i never had any major anything other than the compressor	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
right	0
i never really had anything major with my mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end i had it five years and the last year or last two years it seemed to go out really easily i think it went out twice in two years and that's that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
no hm	1 0
and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the honda but i don't think i'm going to do that again i think i'm going back to automatic now	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i never w[ell] well i kind of know how to drive standard but i've never owned one so i had[n't] i don't drive one a lot	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
so i don't f[eel] feel comfortable in traffic with it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
and for everything i've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it is	1 0 1
and and resale value is really important to me	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
that's true	0 1
yeah it is me too that's why i got the honda	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
hondas have great resale value	0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
the mazda definitely did not not at [laughter-all] they're worse than american cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i did pretty well with my uh regal because it was in really good shape but it still looked real nice the	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
the the interior was still really nice there [what'n/wasn't] cracks all over the dash board and stuff an[d]	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
right	1
and it had some some nice features so i ended up okay with the buick	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
good	1
and i anticipate the same thing with the honda whenever i decide to sell it course i may never sell it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
[laughter-right]	1
i may drive it till it's dead but	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
[laughter-yeah] that's what i did with the mazda drive it till the till the clutch went out and the wheels fell off [laughter-so]	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
[laughter-so] probably what i'll do again	1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
but i really like the hondas i like foreign cars a lot	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
yeah	0
i looked at the mitsubishi galant i was looking for a four door car having driven the rx seven so long	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and it was so small and it's really impractical so i wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of and i looked at the galant and those were really nice and you can get them_1 for a great price	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
oh	1
so that's how i ended up with a honda	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i wasn't even looking for a car when i bought this car i uh i was thinking about buying a prelude from a friend who was moving to new york or something so and she was gonna sell her car because_1 she didn't need it anymore and it was only like a year old and i had never driven uh a prelude so i went to a dealership because they had like uh the same year and same model of prelude on their used car lot and	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	0
and i went and i test drove it and you know i just fell in love with this brand new white prelude you know two liter si with the the sun roof and the moon roof and	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
oh yeah	1 0
they're nice i think	0 1 0 1
and i i bought it loaded	1 1 0 0 0 1
oh yeah	1 0
oh yeah i have to have them_1 loaded i	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
i mean	0 1
i i love all those little things that you [laughter-don't] need but they're so wonderful	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah i went there looking at a used car and two days later i bought this car i	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
i felt i felt like that was the worst impulse that w[as] that was the largest impulse buy i had ever made the	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
the oth[er] the two other things that i've bought on impulse are vcr and a [laughter-washer] and dryer	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i would [laughter-say]	0 0 1
i go for the big stuff	0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i noticed mine was definitely not impulse i really needed a new car mine was just it's getting worn out i guess from being a sports car i drove it kind of hard	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and i got it right after high school so by the time i traded it in it was [laughter-ready]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i got i got my buick as a high school graduation gift	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
ready to [laughter-go]	0 0 1
did you	0 1
yeah but i i guess this [what'n/wasn't] really an impulse i mean buying it right then and you know right quickly was kind of impulsive but i'd been thinking about buying a new car for three years and i was just scared to	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
right	1
i was scared to start taking on payments because the buick was long since paid for	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right that's same with me would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
buy a buy buy a used car	0 1 1 0 0 0 1
like	1
right	1
sure	1
i i was going to buy one once and i just i worry about who's driven them_1 and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that just	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
just i can't seem to get over that that just bothers [laughter-me] i don't know why	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
well um like on hondas they supposedly the maintenance records are supposed to be registered with honda or whatever and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars and you can have them_1 checked out by mechanics and stuff	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah that's true	1 0 1
mean they can't stop you from doing it so	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
hoping that they do go to a honda dealership to get them_1 serviced	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	0
well and even if they didn't you can still get a good idea from a if you can get a good mechanic to check it over real carefully and check the blocks and everything	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
that's true	0 1
so	0
well i guess that's all	1 0 0 0 1
okay well i enjoyed talking to you	1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i enjoyed talking to you	0 0 0 0 1
bye-bye	1
bye-bye	1
well anyway i uh i uh oh i i did forget to ask you what is your name by the way	1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
um i'm ann	1 0 1
oh you're ann hi but um anyway i uh lot of lot of s[tuff] interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if we're going to talking about the subject to[night] tonight which is some i guess criminal courts the	0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
criminal courts yes	0 1 1
yeah the the one of which was uh something something that's been going on because of the rodney king trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race uh ye[ah]	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
oh really	0 1
yeah well the the uh the the people that the the the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel	1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
how is it	0 1 0
i can't i'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh	1
um it's in ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
well that videotape was just horrible	0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah it was everywhere	1 0 0 1
yeah	1
so you know and i i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh i agree with you but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
exactly you know um the you know i i'm kind of torn on this issue it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true but on the other hand is it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
exactly	1
based on fact right	0 0 1 1
how interesting ooh so what's the prevailing thought within the community	1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
um	1
i mean you know what the news media's gonna make of it but what about the community	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i i rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic oh here we go again folks kind of stuff	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
oh my goodness that can't be good for los angeles either	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
no no i you know on on on one hand y[ou] on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's th[ey] they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy um	1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh exactly	0 1
unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to uh a big city like los angeles you're going to have it just about anywhere	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
there	1
well	0
but that's that's interesting	1 0 0 1
yeah um	0 0
what about the judge who's hearing the case is he gonna be impartial is he going to be a g[ood] a good adjudicator	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i don't know you know and and again there's something else th[at] you know there was a uh i[t] something else along those lines there was a girl out here named latausha harlins i don't know if this this got this got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the rodney king problem um girl walked into a korean owned store and uh they she had a dispute black girl	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	1
she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store the owner of the store popped her	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh really	0 1
yeah and and well of course the you know the criminal case went up and and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh uh practically a suspended sentence i mean it was it was just she	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh my goodness	0 0 1
she gave her no time in jail and and you know all of these things and then oh there's uh we have these we have people wandering around to with petitions trying to get the judge	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
to get that judge recalled i would think	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah yeah	1 1
hm that's almost when you kind of wish that there where st[andardized] standardized sentences	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
yeah it would make it would make life easier	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
it would uh	0 1 0
yeah but	1 1
uh you	0 0
but	1
you would know the whole world would know what you were facing and then it's a matter of of deciding g[uilt]	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
okay uh as far as you know crime in the cities i'm sure i[t] like in yours it's pretty pretty bad uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how	0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
how about_1 you	0 0 0
uh well i don't actually live in the city but uh i'd probably say that's roughly right i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but i i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution um and sale of drugs	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum proba[bly] probably right if you look at it from that stand point	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
what uh is there anything that uh that you particularly are concerned with in in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh where i live no it's it's not so bad i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it um but i do have friends who live in the city and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing um just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum do you live in a real small town or or out in the country	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i live out in the country yeah	0 0 0 0 0 1 0
how far out from the city i mean do you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i am about fifteen miles out	0 0 0 0 0 1
about_1 fifteen miles i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
um-hum	0
but it's pretty congested we are considered in the country but	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
hm	0
but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
hm	0
our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drug uh reported	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
however i'm sure they're there	0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
wow	0
that's huge	0 0
and since that time everybody's gotten some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices the sensors and things like that	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
it's cut back you know considerably but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
are they are there any theories on why this is happening	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	0
most	1
but why why is it happening	0 0 0 0 0 0
well most families most families they are young and both people are working	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
uh so uh i would say that's probably their prime motivation they'll s[talk] they'll stalk your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
so they're professionals	0 0 0
um they classify most of them_1 as professionals	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
hm	0
uh you get a few of them_1 that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for uh jewelry are the major targets guns	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
guns that sort of stuff	0 0 1 0 0
hm	0
very few you know penny penny ante stuff	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
well uh the police force for one i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use uh it's oh right now i think uh we're about thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
right	0
and	0
but that mean that's gonna tend to i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right they're doing that in our state t[oo]	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh but for the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
so you think that would be a deterrent	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
that would be certainly be a deterrent	0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
and uh not necessarily you know uh give in to their uh human rights desires you know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them_1 in there till they just suffocate uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
right	0
uh	0
so you'd you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody and	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
hm	0
uh especially you you know in the case of murder	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
right	0
uh i know in my case i ha[d] my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh wow	0 0
oh my goodness	0 0 0
and we caught the individuals got caught we uh we went through the court system and all that sort of thing and	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh you know the the guy only got five years	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
right	0
wow	0
and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system so what what	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
did you did you sue him under the civil system	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
do what now	0 0 0
did you sue him under the civil system	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
n[o] no i'm not real familiar with that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well you probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh	0
and	0
well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him and they said well you know he they're he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that that you could go after	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah makes you wish they had uh still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah uh very seldom	0 0 0 0
but they g[ive] give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah they don't do that here course they pay them but they don't you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah that's too bad	0 0 0 0
and uh you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after them_1 because they're you know they're they're repeat offenders they uh they've been in jail before they've	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum um-hum	0 0
they've been released you know several times which is another uh deal i hate to see	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and uh and car theft on top of it and destroys my car he	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i i think that's a	0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
he we're out you know uh you know fifteen thousand dollars and you know the guy gets out in two months and	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's awful	0 0
and he goes out and commits it again fact he's back in [laughter-jail] now so what what uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes	0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah what what deterrent does he really have	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
uh we've had a couple instances where break-ins where the the people have actually you know shot the people	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh my god	0 0 0
and uh return offenders have they've actually waited for them_1 where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else and try to take it in their own hands course	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	0
course it doesn't always work out in their favor	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	0
but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us you	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
you can you know you can get some of us you	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i mean	0 0
you can't get all of us	0 0 0 1 0 0
mean that	0 0
uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
that sounds that's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah	0
hear you break in and you're gonna get shot	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah that's i mean that's certainly a a possibility an[d] an[d] we have had a a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
and uh it helps for a while	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
hm	0
uh i would say probably eighty percent of them_1 that are caught they're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas you know across the the border	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
wow	0
so you know people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
it's not many from the local communities	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but uh it's a problem and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
would be a definite deterrent and and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
um-hum i mean i i tend to agree with you i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes um there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	0
and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is um if someone is found guilty of a uh felony level offense they lose their citizenship and they lose their constitutional rights	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
you know and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just don't protect them_1	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i know and i think i think that's ridicul[ous]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they they went to all all	1 0 0 0 1 1
okay um i guess um this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh really	1 0
but um	0 0
what kinds of things have you done	1 0 0 1 0 1 1
um well i've made a lot of baby gifts	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
aha	0
it seem like that's like especially lately there's been so many babies that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings um	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
do you ever keep any of your stuff	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
isn't that funny no	1 0 1 0
i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and and it it's kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh well can you go to so and	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah isn't that funny i guess i do have one thing um a friend of mine gave me a clock kit and	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
ooh	0
and i i needlepointed the the face and i uh kept that because she gave me that so	0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
that that would be definitely something you'd want to keep	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh yeah and it's real neat	1 0 0 0 0 0
was was the whole face done or just the numbers uh and and like minute marks	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
um basically the the whole well no i guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they're like hearts	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh	0
and then the at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i did some needlepoint years ago and then i got into the bargello	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh what's that	0 0 0
well it's an italian um needlework using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the uh hum the what what kind of cloth uses that i i've just gone blank but it's used wi[th] uh with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
huh	0
and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
wow well that's interesting what did you what kind of things did you do	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
what i did when when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth and i can't find one that i've done	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh	0
it's one of those things i didn't i didn't give them away but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or or what and	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
and it i was so proud of them when i got them finished but i have no idea where they are	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
what did you call that	0 0 0 0 0
bargello it's b a r g e double l o	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
huh that's i've never heard of that before i've probably seen it though i	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i suspect you i suspect you have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i mean when you described it	0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess but um i've never heard of it before and it's really interesting um i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i've kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
me too	0 0
really	0
yeah that's interesting	0 0 0
yeah it [laughter-is]	0 0 0
how did you know to choose this subject tonight that's funny uh uh what how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas[kets] how were you decorating the baskets	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons um	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
um	0
um i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons they make them they like i don't know how to explain it they make them hard you know	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
like fabric that's been stiffened in	0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yes	0
i've never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but um	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i've seen some and there there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh definitely yeah	0 0 0
when i do um crochet it's it's usually the the lacy victorian type things like that and	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh	0
and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture it's like white glue and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then um allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don't know i	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh	0
i was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh uh high humidity in in a room	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
that's i think that's what my concern was you know wasn't really sure and how they would how they would last	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
do you know what my concern is how will i dust this thing	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
you're [laughter-right] no	0 0 0
i'm [laughter-terrible]	0 0
no that's true [laughter-though] that's funny	0 0 0 1 0 0
so many of my crafts well right now i'm looking at a little uh uh quilted uh uh hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be out and so forth and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and most of my things are dust collectors	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh and i hate to dust	0 0 0 0 0 0
i know	0 0
so that's the first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
that's funny no i just um i don't i have really have gotten out of it i don't do it quite as much as i used to um i guess because i i went back to school so i don't have as much time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh you don't have time	0 0 0 0 1
now and i have two children [laughter-also] [laughter-so]	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
you definitely don't have [laughter-time]	0 1 0 0 0
it keeps me very busy but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know it's really it's so relaxing to just sit and but once i get started i can't put it down i just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i have a similar problem i've got to have time or i don't even want to get into it in the first place	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	1 0
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i know i started a project it's been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for [laughter-christmas] and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
you just didn't say which christmas right	0 0 0 0 0 1 1
that's what i keep telling this [laughter-person] well i didn't tell you what year	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
what was this project	0 0 0 0
um well it's a it's uh cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and trees and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as i'd like to you know it's just so hard	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
now this is this is done in the needlepoint	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh uh well i shouldn't it's counted cross stitch actually is what i'm doing and so it's really since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work	0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yes yes i do know i	0 0 0 0 0 0
yep	0
i have done a little bit of that but i've decided that that's something that demands my time my my to[tal] my total attention	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and so i've got to have total almost total silence i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece it	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
yep	0
it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
no it really isn't and i tell you really i could just kick myself for even starting [laughter-it] because i have a feeling i'm never going to get it done i'm probably going to hear about it the rest of [laughter-my] [laughter-life]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh i'm sure you'll get it done but it just maybe not on the original obviously not on the original time schedule	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
no that's true i i just don't know when i'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard but i really do en[joy] like i said i really enjoy it when i do it's just hard	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and there's there's so many other things that i i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs and wall hangings and so you know those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
no no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay	0
and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don't usually use the colors they tell me to	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um	0
and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's what i would do too	0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i yeah yeah	0 0 0 0
or or whatever i have [laughter-that's]	0 0 0 0 0 0
there's yeah there's a a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many real simple ones you know i do i've made i made a little uh uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
ooh	0
it was really easy i mean just just did a thumb print you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
what with ink	0 0 0
uh-huh	0
oh okay	0 0
and then see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple [laughter-and]	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh that sounds really neat	0 0 0 0 0
it didn't take anything at all and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0
did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum and then i just	0 0 0 0 0
okay so you just just like being finger printed	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you wanna go first	0 1 1 1
no you can start	0 0 1 1
okay um one of the things they talked about was uh did we di[d] wha[t] do what do we think about a judge making the decision	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	1
and i really don't agree with that i think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than e[ven] having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
right	1
y[ou] you know what i mean	0 0 0 0 0 1
right there's there th[is] thi[s] this topic is kind of moot um there	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
yeah	1
there there's no way we we couldn't survive in a sy[stem] in a in a juror syst[em] in a trial system without a jury	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
um one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
that's it	0 1
um every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult um	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system i i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
i mean i[f] if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's uh no question it's	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
right	1
it's beyond a reasonable doubt you all these things i mean you know we've gone through this uh over and over again	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
right they shouldn't allow an appeal	1 0 0 0 0 1
and it can go on for ten twenty years	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
yep	1
i i think this is a little ridiculous	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
[laughter-um-hum]	1
i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
no that's right i work for a law firm [laughter-i] [laughter-ought]	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
i i'm serious and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha[t] ha[ppen] that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
right	1
you know if someone is	1 0 0 1 1
well plea bar[gaining] plea bargaining is a different story	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
well	1
plea bargaining is something completely different that that actually prevents trials or or at least speeds them_1 up	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
well i know tha[t's] that's what i'm saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh and that they have to do something	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
hum	1
you you know what i'm saying tha[t] we we don't have um well a lot of states don't have capital punishment	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
and um i i think they should	1 0 0 0 0 0 1
we do	1 1
i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and um you know all	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
right	1
they they're caught dead to rights i i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
right when you're saying as as far as the appeal um procedure is concerned	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
we just have the case i'm i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
um his fi[nal] his last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up	1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
oh really	0 1
so i mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail for cocaine possession	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
it uh	0 0
yeah	1
but um that was absurd there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i know that the	1 0 1 0
uh-huh an[d] i don't know uh wha[t] what would you do to change it to make it better	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
well uh the the only thing i can i was you know the the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of um i like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd there's no way that could work	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah i i i don't agree with that at all	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um but	1 1
imagine the guilt that person would have i mean it burned out	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh exactly	0 1
is there's no possible way that you could um you know feel good about yourself	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
exactly	1
right	1
if you had to do something like that day after day	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
no one would want the job	0 0 0 0 0 1
no rea[lly] not really	1 1 0 1
um and you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case	1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well wou[ld] do you think people should have a trial if they're caught dead to rights like	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
oh yeah i i feel that everyone is everyone is um entitled to a trial by jury that that that right sh[ould]	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
well i mean were there witnesses	1 0 1 0 0 1
in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
right that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place and	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
well it's i i feel	0 0 1 1 0
okay what do you think about it	1 0 1 0 1 1 0
well uh the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so	1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
oh yeah	0 1
um i i think a lot of it has to do with women working	1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah	0
i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby but that will be it	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
ye[ah] yeah	0 1
i mean i[t] it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
right right	1 0
they can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
and it and it seems if you're going to have kids uh that you are you know society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
and uh because if you have you know two well if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care two or three you know um	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
right	1
now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didn't have to work	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
oh that is good	1 0 1 0
i mean i didn't work i i needed to but i didn't	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah steve's steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in uh march and she doesn't have to work either i don't know how they do it i don['t] i don't know how people do it with one you know um obviously	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you wou[ld] you know	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
yeah obviously we don't have any and and i don't i think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married and not have kids	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh yeah	0 1
and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to se[t] have have your family and i don't think it's been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
right right	1 0
you know and	0 0 0
well it's getting where you can't hardly afford if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
right	1
and i mean it's hard with two now we uh my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh	1
but if i had a third one i just don't know where it would come from	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
[laughter-yeah]	0
yeah	0
because i work now i work full time and uh you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh yeah i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
right and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous i mean absolutely outrageous and	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1
oh i know i know	0 0 1 0 0
and they're getting worse uh my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
jeez	0
and this book is a little bitty skinny book	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
but it is it's getting worse and if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
but that's that's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if i'd of had four i guess it's always not not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right but i think i would have had to work	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
if i'd of had that many i'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
but i think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
then you go to work and you work	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah	0
because if you have two or three kids by the way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work and it's just going to be an accepted thing there isn't going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah and and that's all right with me because i don't want to stay home	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
you know i think i'm just part of tha[t] the new stuff that is just i don't know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
and um well i work all week and um i can't imagine how i stayed home	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
you know i think to myself what did i do and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job you know and then when everything's set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	1
where now when i graduated high school the thing	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
that's you did that's what you did uh	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i mean that's just the way it was you know	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
and uh that's like when my mo[m] i know when my mother's age it was always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i uh i i like the way it is	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
it's uh being see we're from houston and so it's not so hard for people you know you've been married three or so years and you don't have kids well it's okay no[t] nobody does but you come to a place like belton and th[ere] a lot of the kids here get married out of high school	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
it's real small town and it's and a lot of people in our su[nday] we're the only couple in our sunday school class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they can't have children who don't have children and they can't imagine why we would want to have children and i'm going well you know there's more to life you know there's life in there that's	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
you know not everybody has to have kids and i'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here it's your turn you know	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
and uh i didn't have kids for four and a half years but that was because i wanted to work and i wasn't ready for kids	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah i think that's what it is i'm not either	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
they're probably going oh i bet she can't get pregnant	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
well you don't just get ready but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and uh kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have it i don't care what anybody tells you	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
right	1
and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
and uh even though i'd like to have grandchildren i can see her point	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah steve's mom finally uh finally s[aid] you know said that that god will take care of us when it's our time	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
she finally admitted you know she finally told me it's okay if you don't but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
and she stayed home and raised her kids and and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives and to be the the housewife and have dinner ready by five and and you know be there at every beck and call and i was raised totally opposite [laughter-how] we got together i don't know but because my mother had six girls and you know she worked too	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
and i guess i just and i saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough it was hard you know	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah and it really is i know it just like now you know there's there's so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
but the rest of it we just buy things like boats or we go on trips or you know just the more or less like entertainment stuff	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
right	1
but	1
yeah i think you've you've earned that though	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah i feel like i have you know because well we're to the age now i'm not old but i'm older	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and uh i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
i really couldn't i don't think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but to me it [laughter-feels] [laughter-like] [laughter-i] [laughter-must] have done nothing	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	0
and i think it's just the new way that people are thinking	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i think so	0 0 0 1
but uh	1 0
i think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
well you know more and more of them are i don't know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals they're getting day care	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
are they	1 0
but the reason they had to do this was because so many people you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
right	1
so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i don't know if the ti in dallas does or not i know i know nobody around here does it we're it's too small around here	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
oh really	0 1
yeah	1
hello	1
hello	1
hi	1
this is lois	0 1 1
hi this is lisa	1 0 0 1
and um i called you know from that the the ti database calling instructions	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
um-hum yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah this is about changes in women in the	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
um-hum	1
uh there's really a lot isn't [laughter-there] [laughter-i]	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1
yeah	1
[laughter-i] [laughter-mean] there really is	1 0 0 0 1
[i]t's kind of an easy thing to talk about	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
yeah um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
okay all right	1 1 0
okay	1
are you ready now	0 0 0 1
yes	1
okay like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yes i know because_1 i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess she's in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and i've never faced that at all	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um no i think n[ow] now you go to work when they're six weeks old you know and	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
and you stay there and i feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband you know	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah um-hum i think it's definitely gotten better	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh i do too much and it's just gonna get better	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	0
it really is	1 0 1
because_1 women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh i can't either not a one	1 0 0 1 0 0 1
i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
i don't think that men really took the time to work on that [laughter-sort] [laughter-of] [laughter-thing]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah even in washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
yes yes	1 1
i think that would be the best goal	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess it's kind of an ideal world though huh	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social security numbers you know and	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
and that way they can't say well they picked the male over a female or female over a male you know you	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah yeah	1 1
your age or anything i think that'd be a wonderful way to do it	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i do too just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum and then	0 0 1
and if you get it you know then	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
um-hum also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
um-hum	0
like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah	1 1
as a matter of fact that's what i'm doing	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
is it	1 0
um-hum it sure is	0 0 0 1
that would be great	0 0 0 1
it sure is	0 0 1
or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on loa to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house and sh[e] you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh	0
i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah yes that is	1 1 0 1
i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
um-hum	0
all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh i do i	1 0 1 0
do you	0 1
i really do i think it's great	0 0 1 0 0 0 1
do you work like half days or half weeks or	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh well like one week she'll work three days and i'll work two and the next week you know i'll work three and she'll work two	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh is oh that's great	0 0 1 0 1
we just share off like that	0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh do you get the full benefits	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum yeah we get the full benefits	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh that's wonderful	1 0 1
but we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
yeah especially_1 with children and so many things going on that would be great	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
it really is and that way we're not really missing anything out you know of those children uh-huh	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
either way yeah	0 1 1
uh-huh	0
yeah you have your career and your home life and that'd be a nice way to especially_1 if you have young children	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
oh it is it is well both of ours is school age but we don't want to miss any of those pta's and you know all of that so	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you're involved in that	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum yeah yes i think it's great i really	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
and i look for more of that in the next generation	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yes oh i do too	1 0 0 0 1
plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because_1 you've got two days off that you can do everything so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
most time now you know it's just a weekend or just forget it	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
that's been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening so that's real helpful so you don't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour i don't know how many times i've done that to do [laughter-something] post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
to do [laughter-yeah]	0 1 0
so	1
um-hum yeah i think we've really come a long ways in that because	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because_1 i just it's always been that way	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but i know	0 0 1
yeah but i can remem[ber] remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh yes um-hum where oh yeah	0 1 0 1 1 1
i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and wor[k] women work in the same job i think men get paid more	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh i do too	1 0 0 1
but i think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but mean you can see that it's wrong and	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yes yes	1 0
and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
they really are	0 0 1
yeah i think it's getting better not worse well i should probably get back to my job	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
[laughter-i-] [laughter-know] [laughter-i] know the feeling	0 0 0 0 0 1
call again	0 1
okay and i sure will and bye-bye	1 0 0 0 1 0 1
okay bye-bye	0 1
okay um yeah one year public service for everybody is that that was it right	1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
right uh who wants to start this one	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
i don't know i've been i've been sitting here thinking here because it was you know took a couple tries before i found somebody well you know i'm like i'm not really sure what i think about this um uh i mean the first thing is the oh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory i mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know but you know senators' sons and all that stuff too i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0
right right	1 0
i mean everybody's got to do it um i don't know it'd probably be it'd probably be good i just don't know if you know if i was eighteen or whatever i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i'm not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision uh i mean uh that that doesn't sound right um i guess i see overall beneficial if we're if we're just going from that point of view	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
um i you know in the past i don't know i don't know how old you are but when i was uh in high school was uh beginning of vietnam and so forth and many of my peers were being drafted	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever but i i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that that they could help the country in other ways be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and i guess i see that as as not so much a a demand but but a privilege it's it's kind of uh uh it's something i[t's]	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah is um	1 0 0
it's since since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest i just see that as maybe a good idea i wouldn't mind doing it at forty four	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
uh and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others uh and i i guess i i can't see that as being something to really object to	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
well i guess it's going to depend on how i mean if if you're talking about any if you're talking about something that's like a full time you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know you're going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff i mean i you know i don't know	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i could see a a full a run a gamut of different kinds of opportunities things that need to be done that wou[ld] that could be done in an hour or two uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on saturday or something like that in addition to what one does uh besides that	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
i i can't imagine what kind of uh uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time oh you're going to go to this camp and you're going to you know like um back in the depression the ccc the the construction corps that went out and did things that was great it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
it was needed it gave folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but um i don't see that as being necessary now i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
uh i i guess i see all of us benefiting and i i don't see it just relegated to the young but i see i i see so much going on that that's bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem something	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
something that they turn back	0 0 0 0 1
well	0
and also you know you you you feel more like you know you're actually part of the community if you've done something in it	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
that's right	0 1
you take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
and i i see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives it	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh definitely	0 1
it may not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county because then you're you're coming in contact with it it's not as meaningful for me to go to minnesota and do something up there that i'll never be able to see again unless i happen to go on vacation up there	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
right	1
yeah	1
it's so it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah	1
but as far as putting that into work i don't want to i don't want to deal with the with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh uh that would be a nightmare	0 0 0 1 0 1 1
and just i mean just getting getting it going	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah	0
i i see a lot of things like uh scouting uh boys clubs girls clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing and	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
uh-huh	1
and and i guess i don't see uh this being that different but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
do you have kids	0 0 0 1
n[o] uh no not yet about_1 six months we will	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh well good good you have a little time think about that i guess i i have uh when i was teaching school i saw many ki[ds] so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose and i can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
i know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have but that's uh tha[t] that would be a part of selling it to the community to	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation there'd definitely have to be a major pr campaign in each community each county uh parish or however the state was divided up	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
hum i may well i don't know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee[p] and i i've seen it in other states too i	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah they have that here um	0 0 0 0 1 0
i don't know	1 0 0
um	1
they've got um in most of the states around here i think uh you know down in north carolina there was a big controversy for a while because_1 the uh the local chapter of the kkk wanted to uh um to participate in it and	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
and uh there was a	0 0 0 0 0
and there were those that said no you can't do that i'm sure	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah well uh it was it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know should	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
should these people be allowed to or not i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
oh and i hadn't even thought about that uh the oth[er] the other end of that that that's an interesting uh situation i hadn't thought of that we had visited relatives in virginia not too long ago and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah i think virginia's got it and i know maryland does and we just we went to indianapolis last weekend and back and um i'm pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in ohio and indi[ana] indiana about it and pennsylvania maybe pennsylvania i don't remember for sure now	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
and i don't know about your part of the country but uh down here in the last y[ear] oh year plus i it was las[t] beginning with last year's earth day there's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
and e[ven] i work for texas instruments and	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
and they they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because_1 they said well it's not feasible it's	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
it's not a good idea and i see that as being i i see that as being a a a change um it for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing it's	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah and but then they lost too much business	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it's just thing a part of everyone's consciousness	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh well the thing about that is though it's got a i mean because it was i mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that and you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue and i i'm worried that it it might you know it'll it the same thing will happen it's like you know environmentalism was really big for a couple of years and then people like well you know i'd rather rather spend you know fifty cents less on uh on on such and such you know and even if it's not environmentally safe who cares you know	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life and if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
but it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's burning out of control in [laughter-in] the persian gulf and and so forth just just every little bit does it makes me feel better it it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
well yeah uh uh well wouldn't it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
that's that's right because	0 0 1 1
of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say uh coming from where you are in texas	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh no no because if we what was it in seventy four when we had the the last last oil crisis an[d] and uh we started getting smart and and we were looking all these alternative sources of energy and so forth	0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swung the other way	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
right	1
and we need those reminders	1 1 1 0 1
yeah	1
uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right well my dad's in the in the solar energy business so um you know we're acutely aware of a lot of this but	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
ah	1
but [laughter-you] know on the other hand he voted for george bush so um you know i i wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
well i thi[s] you know just about anybody you could name whether i voted for them or not uh makes um uh decisions that i just can't go along with	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
but uh that's why they're there and not me i don't want the i don't want the [laughter-stress] and	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
well the the thing with bush	1 0 0 0 0 1
okay well like i was saying burlington's crime it doesn't involve children and what you see on the tv's from you know in washington and new york so what i believe the people want the subject is is big city crime which is something that i don't have any first hand experiences about but i have you know concerns and i have a few ideas of um how to combat it i	1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	1
i mean i don't i don't think uh ideally you know you need money to do everything so that's one thing that	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
that that's one thing that that's that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money so	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right yeah well when uh we lived in san antonio i grew up around san antonio and it's always been a very large uh city and increasingly growing it's has kind of the split population um there's a lot of retired military uh individuals that live there and then there's a very large hispanic population there and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic uh gang crime in the city	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh	0
and that is uh been the worse thing that we've seen happening uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people's community or does it stay in the bad neighborhood	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
um the majority of the actual gang crimes like the the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods but the crime spreads out into the more affluent uh divisions through robberies rape and uh car crime there's a very large uh or very high percentage of car theft and san an[tonio] san antonio's not far from the border to mexico so a a lot of the uh cars go to uh you know hack shops and they take them_1 apart and a lot of them_1 go over the border especially like mercedes a lot of those those in the the z uh the z cars the datsun cars end up over the border and uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
so that's a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
very much so	0 0 0
very much so in fact um for a while there uh they had downtown if you were to co[me] come to a stop light they had a a rash of where people were uh when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up so now uh ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there and uh once you've reached the the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during th[e] during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys and um you know or or alone if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have th[e] the river patrol cops it's very nice but at at evening um again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice but you don't want to get off the beaten track um there's a lot of parking garages there because um parking is very tight and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage um alone	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh my it sounds like um san juan puerto rico we were there just well for a lay over	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
and um well it wasn't a lay over we were some we had we were staying at the other end the island we drove into san juan to catch our plane	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
um-hum	0
it was at night and this boy really wanted to go on the beach and they look at you crazy you	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
you don't go on the beach i	0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
well it's a big tourist town you know don't they don't people go for a walk on the beach at night and they said no it's very safe in the daytime	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it's just so sad you know it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more um in san antonio i don't know what the answer is uh education i think is a lot of it um so many of the kids are are drop outs um uh they ha[ve] there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels i think education helps a little bit there um they again i don't know really what steps there are that they	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
and what we have here in burlington which it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
they set up kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
uh uh-huh	0 0
they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer and they have gyms open and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school you might keep them	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
but you again you need that one on one like a big brother trying to keep the the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school it'll get better you know so that your mom doesn't have a job and	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and and she doesn't wor[k] you don't know you can be better than that you don't have to live on the you know the for a street life	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
but	0
uh-huh that's good that sounds like they've got a lot going on there	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here i mean um they can deal with that scale	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
they might have five hundred troubled youths	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into th[e] well the kids now they're so it's twelve years old and they're selling drugs and	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0
it's just it's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society but if i had a child that that that did things so bad it's not they don't care about anybody	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and we don't have it so we deserve it and we should take it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh yeah i don't know how you combat that i i don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids um so many of them all they see is just the gangs	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old the	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh yeah	0 0
the parents might be thirty years old	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
and i'm thirty years old and i'm kind of irresponsible but i have the morals that keep me from you know if i was going to go out and drink or do something i wouldn't do it in front of my child these people you know they bring their their johns home and they bring their drugs home and the kids are just sitting there in the same room	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
it's ju[st] just that they have absolutely no no morals	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
and it's really sad	0 0 0 1
and i don't know how you combat that i rea[lly] i don't know what the answer is to that problem you know i	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
but i like your idea of education	0 0 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
if the parents aren't supplying it they've got to get it from someone else from the schools	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
and what do those kids do they get it at school and come home what do they do then i i feel i feel for them i don't know how to make it better for them or you know unless because it they can't remove themselves they can't just leave and say okay well it's not acceptable i'm leaving the big city mom and i'm i'm going off you know when they're ten they have to live in it and uh-huh	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah it's really sad like if they did have a big brother big sister program	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
those those people trying to help the kids the parents might have hostilities towards them you know like you're judging us and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
right i think so and uh	0 0 0 0 0 0
and i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
it it it's i'm glad i don't live in a big city just because i mean not just because i wouldn't feel safe it's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh yeah	0 0
it's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i don't see and	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and i might see it on a you know a a sixty minute special	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh no in san antonio it was like every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
i know it but san antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh oh yeah but um-hum but there's a lot of them it's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
but any big city has a bad section	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
it's very prevalent a lot of the the crime is very prevalent	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes they're very bold it seems	0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh very much when we moved here to monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above carmel and um there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed around here and um those that aren't there's celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there um migrant hispanic farm workers uh people that are down and out and uh they all seem to congregate in celinas not so much here in monterrey so it's it's pretty quiet i've bee[n] you know we walk the streets at night and uh people run in the park and you know you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
really even uh even in the worst crime areas in burlington i i can walk the streets i wouldn't i if i did it every night i think there would be trouble in our house so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
so you wouldn't get confronted or anything	0 0 0 0 1 0 0
right	0
but i don't think you would uh someone might grab you mess around with you but they're not going to grab you steal you[r] your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
[laughter-i] [laughter-mean] that's you you're gonna have to expect that to happen people are just totally unfeeling	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

yeah well i i have a dog that god gave us too	1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1

um	1
wow	1

and she just you know thinks it's great	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
thi[s] this friend of mine has th[e] well it's the same guy that was watching uh my german shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on friday and took he's got a full a pure bred golden retriever and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing and this they just they had a ball romping around and	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
and you know you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
getting in yeah	1 0 1
and uh this golden retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh no	0 1
well no actually he had no trouble at all he first jumped in and i he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really i don't think he'd swum before	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
really	1
but he jumped in in the the river	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
did puppy go to	0 0 0 1
well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the the fast moving water because_1	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh that's good yeah	0 0 1 1
because_1 if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
and up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
ewe ewe	1 1
and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh this dog dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he he jumped in again and	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon he loved it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
cocoa didn't think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and uh made me pull her back out	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad and	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
yeah	1
and so but she got over it so	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
well the german shepherd that i had before we we had a little pool	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step she'd just get on the first step and lay down you know in the summertime when it's really really hot	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
yeah	1

yeah i've i live right across the street from a a big lake here um it's on oneida lake and i'm wondering if uh if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year i mean i've got the yards all fenced in so she doesn't run loose but uh she could go in sometime when if i'm watching her some[thing]	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
um-hum	1

oh okay my my dog last german shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too and that was the thing i couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake it wasn't like he didn't	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
um-hum	1

yeah well that's how cleo w[as] you know she'd lay on her step	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
but that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0

it is great	0 0 1
uh really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately but	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah	1

well we always wait until we can rent them you know	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah yeah well i'm uh i'm a second lieutenant in the air force and so i travel a lot and	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

uh-huh	1
but it's nice having a dog here uh the	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah there's just	0 1 0 1
oh n[o] oh no what's the unrequir[ed] what's the word i'm looking for uh lots of affection no co[nditional] unconditional affection from the from the [laughter-dog]	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
that's it	0 1
yeah yeah	1 1
really not critical at all	1 0 0 0 1
no no	1 1
yeah they're really wonderful	0 0 0 1
yeah well it's been nice talking to you we seem to be degenerating here so	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i i guess i get my money's worth for	1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
okay	1
i'm not sure though whether i feel i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas i[sn't] isn't correct	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well i'm sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that because_1 everybody has a different idea of where the money should go	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
well i i lately i guess um uh or at least for the last t[wenty] twenty years or so i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there and i'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there uh regardless of the outcome of the desert storm uh desert shield uh situations	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi[litary] military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a as a given in any military operation and	0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh yeah no argument here	0 1 0 0 0
yeah and i gue[ss] i i should imagine that that that what the what the problem why i i'm i'm a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and and easy i don't know i shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh mideast uh uh over the uh iraqis uh might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe i'm i i don't know what other foe that would be but uh i i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah well of course uh a lot of uh a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the and the inventory's going to have to be restocked uh on now i work for ti and one of the things we were told is like they had eleven thousand harm missiles which ti is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in in the war so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed	1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah but it it it it would that be uh well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh i i should imagine that that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated w[as] was when the soviet threat i guess was perceived as being a greater one i don't think there's very much of a threat there today i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and who's controlling them but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
that that's true that's true	0 0 0 0 0
i i don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything uh that would be irrational	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
well of of course now we used up twenty per cents per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	0
yeah	0
and uh uh uh ti also makes the missile which was the the tv laser guided bombs	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
and and a big percentage of that was expended as well that that w[as] that was just a matter of	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
w[hat] what is the name of that	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh it's called paveway	0 0 0 0
yes yes	0 1
and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also so tho[se] those are two areas in which ti stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah well i i i'm what i'm uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and that that was an area that i i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i don't know it just seems to me that over the years now the and and it's it's a cliche i i but i see it myself i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh no doubt	0 0 0
i i i don't know uh i kn[ow] i'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas so i don't totally agree with the the great uh uh with the with the great ex[penditure] expenditure of effort and time there but i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh and uh rural school systems are like i i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah as a matter of fact in texas um we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by the a state judge and they and uh the legislature just passed what they called a robin hood bill which basically what it does is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that are that are you know come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
that they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system or	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
uh well	0 0
or is it all funded out of local taxes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay to g[ive] to give you some perspective this this town that i had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
then we had a number of education reforms that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts so	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
sounds like the way the federal and state system works [laughter-now]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
really so	0 0
yeah	0
so so what ended up happening was was a was a shift we went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years and uh i mean	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
uh do you mean a a complete reversal because i guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
oh complete complete it's all shifted to local districts and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
that's right and and i have i have no problem with uh a certain uh floor level minimum level that's a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
but i am opposed to any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yes i see what you're saying uh i uh i i do i i guess i am a s[trong] uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education i mean by that i mean i'm a product myself i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the gi bill	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so did i my master's anyway	1 0 1 0 0 0
what but uh when i look at it to me uh it doesn't really make any difference it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldn't have done i don't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial uh easement made possible	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
that's right	0 1
and i i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an [laughter-whether] [laughter-you're] [laughter-a] [laughter-veteran] or whether you i don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the that that the subsidy itself or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation would give many people who i i think i i think i perceive the fact at	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their uh out of their uh budget i know in the state of florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the in the uh state land grant colleges which which isn't i mean to me it doesn't sound like a lot of money but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year they	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
they went from eleven to fifteen hundred	0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent i don't know what that would be	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah they had to they had to raise uh community college taxes here a few years ago too	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
but that uh i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that that the program now is a uh program now is uh fees that that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states and the states now establish uh don't have enough money so	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
so they they must charge fees uh i i i'm not too sure of that reasoning	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
but i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes i i i travel extensively in europe and see enormous uh people p[ay] pay uh a great deal in taxes they tell me when i sit and talk to people there they tell me they they some states they pay uh in germany or in in england in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh oh i can believe that	1 0 0 0 0 1
but but i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of uh now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yep yeah	0 0
i'm not sure that i'm not up fairly close to that	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
well i guarantee you you'd be paying a lot more in taxes i[f] if uh the democrats had more say	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
you really think so	0 0 0 0
yeah i really do	0 0 0 0
but i mean w[hat] what's what's happened here is is is i feel that that in the last ten years uh my taxes have gone up they haven't gone down i pay uh quite a bit more taxes and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and and and	0 0 0
every everybody is	0 0 0
but that's been a republican government for the last ten years	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well what what what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase to keep it to keep it b[ecoming] from becoming even more obnoxious	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i	0 0
yeah	0
well this has been really interesting and i've enjoyed our talk	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay uh i guess i just push something here push one again right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
no you just uh we just say say good-bye and that's it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
just hang up okay don good talking with you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
nice talking with you too	0 0 0 0 0
bye-bye	0
bye-bye	0
i've uh i've well i've had i used to have the opinion that there wa[s] that there really wasn't any more crime in america in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries uh before uh simply because the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced uh reporting methods with computers and other devices	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
compile more statistics	1 1 0
that's right and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets	1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	1
however i have been persuaded lately i guess simply by the uh overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
more especially where you are you in washington dc or washington state	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
well yeah	1 1
no i am in i am in washington d c	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah i was going to say	1 0 0 0 1 0 0
actually it you know i do a lot of business here and i come here quite often and and that again is a is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington regardless of the racial makeup but	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
oh yeah	0 0
but it's it's these real uh there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
it just really grabs your attention it	0 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
it just makes the whole place seem like that	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right now just to focus on that a minute i guess uh um when um previous secretary of uh educate bennett i think his name was became the drug czar uh for uh uh president bush he was going to focus on it on this area and do something about it and	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
yeah	0
and i see that even he was met without with with little success even though the entire i guess a a quite a bit of money and and other uh planning efforts went into that	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
what do you what do you think is is causing all this because	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
well	0
because it seems that there there even though crime though though i think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yes	0
well i uh i have three theories about it you know three things i have one theory and it's by two things one i i believe that this is a function of uh the violence that young people see on television and in the movies	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
um-hum	0
and i am not just talking about you know uh role models of uh of tough guys and gangsters and things like that i'm i'm not even i'm not even convinced that maybe things like uh football hockey and the the and and you know the the and even baseball games now where the everything is settled with a fight you know the the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the uh the argument and	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
and and then i i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree so i think that particularly i i was reading the other day about uh corpus christi texas which has the highest i think it's corp[us] corpus christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in america uh per capita i	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
hum	1
yeah i i haven't seen that but uh	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
i mean the saturday night special stuff so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	1
that that's what i think about it that's some of the things i think about it plus uh i know what are your views	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well yeah i tend to agree with you with you know it seems anymore uh a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some some sort of violence or something in it and	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yes	0
and and along with that you know and then you start making a movie and it it has no there's no call for something violent but so they just throw something in there just to say they have it	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
exac[tly] well that's that's that's the impression i get yeah and	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
and i and i imagine it's it you know it just feeds upon itself when when we have this sort of violence in society people want to it conditions people to it and uh you have to emph[asize] it has to be even uh magnified to attract people's attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah you become callous	1 0 0 0
yeah	0
and i am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
uh i mean i i read now where where you know women are arr[ested] young women are arrested fighting with knives over over whatever whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when i was young now	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um	0
now i do not want to sound like an old fart but but that that's what	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
seems that those things happened before it didn't happen in that manner before television and	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and i i i i have to think that that it has some influence on it but	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i listening to a radio talk show today at lunch time uh rush limbaugh i	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
i do not know if you listen to him or not he's	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
no	0
he's on am but uh there there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the uh that there was a interview done on the assistant chief of police for los angeles the guy under gates	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh yes	0 0
and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals for instance uh they asked him if he spanked his kids and he said you bet i believe in discipline and people i i i i guess they confuse confused discipline with punishment	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
you know and	0 0 0
yeah	0
and ju[st] it seems anymore that uh if if you have you know this type of a moral stance that people come down on you it's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing and i disagree and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yes yes well i mean i i guess so what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was uh that uh there's so mu[ch] there's so much of a return from pris[on] to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure and and that is not emphasized i recognize there's there's over crowding problems and and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that that's complicated the entire process	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
what i also think is that i i guess it's the reflection of of the society where where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to uh you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you where you live or i do not mean respons[ibility] attachment and responsibility i guess i mean any sort of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
well nobody feels responsibility to do something it's like oh boy i wish they would stop doing that [laughter-yeah]	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yes that's right th[at]	0 0 0 0
[laughter-yeah]	0
yeah i i do not know how that's i do not think it's done by uh the changes come simply by statutory nature i do not know what it really will take	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
hum	0
and i do not know if i have solutions except except to you know i am sort of a a an advocate of of uh of letting people of having free speech and i guess to curb uh television uh the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
however there does seem to be a right now in verbalizing it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah and then how many	0 0 0 0 0
and the sacrifice isn't that great	0 0 0 0 0 0
how how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between you know what you see and how you i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
yeah	0
i mean what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes yes i think i think that's correct	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and and yes but you know as soon as you start uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well texas has uh texas has uh has always struck me i mean i i i have lived in and out of texas both in the service and and uh uh short business stints and it seems to me they are a pretty pretty tough law and order state but but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state just citing that you know	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
yeah uh unfortunately you man got a lot of the uh some well a lot of it can be contributed to the the the racial differences i mean just you know we are so close to the border with mexico we've	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
we've got a lot of that influence	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh information about selecting a school	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do	1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
uh-huh	0
uh once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah uh do you do you feel that the first two years that the um depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway it's it's your core education your general requi[rements] general education requirements	1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
um if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't i don't know what advice i'd give them go to the school you'd like to go to	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
that's what i did	0 0 1 0
yeah	0
i didn't care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah what was your degree in	0 0 1 0 0 1
uh political science	0 0 0
political science oh okay well i kn[ow] i know i'm going to school right now and uh i have a friend	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
where are you at	0 0 0 0
uh utd university of texas dallas	0 0 0 0 0 0
well yeah i guess everybody's in dallas that i talk to i'm in north carolina	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i know	0 0
that's where texas instruments is	0 0 1 0 0
yeah right	0 0
um something that i i think that i've noticed that i i have a friend i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sure	0
and uh it's a lot cheaper	0 0 0 0 0 0
oh yeah	1 0
my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um	0
and she found out after that she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money this is about twenty years ago	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
but uh well right now i just i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it does um i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
um originally i had planned uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration and i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided to hell with it i didn't want it um and from that point i went to law school	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay	0
haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean that's that's where i wanted to be but i didn't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney i just wanted a law degree	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i like	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and you don't have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
right	0
so that's that's what i'm pursuing right now	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
um	1
and i'm pretty happy with it so far	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah i'm i'm pursuing what they what's what's called an interdisciplinary field i'm a speech therapy major	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah that's	0 1
and	0
that's probably very useful	1 0 0 1
yeah it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and um i also have a good languages background linguistics and some psychology so	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
so it's all working together	1 0 0 1 1
yeah	0
the only field i'm not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires about four or five different fields really	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
oh good grief	0 0 0
so it's a	0 0 0
yeah yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
i said uh i couldn't do this everyday	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
no way	0 0
um	0
maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
oh so you are a disgruntled graduate student	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i am a dis[gruntled] i am i am just a disgruntled person all around	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh	0
i'm the uh i'm the uh original uh mister scrooge i guess	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah bah humbug	0 0 0
yeah bah humbug yeah i just	0 0 0 0 0 1
i i i think yeah there is i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into um i know one time i was in a political science class and you know talking about fields people going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers about uh their integrity being questionable and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
and i mean oh that was like a can of worms	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
no no there was a woman she said my my best friends are lawyers and you know all this and it was just	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
well that remark in itself is a slam my best friends are lawyers	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
yeah i know it	0 0 0 0
you know like like uh you know my best friends are blacks	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
or jewish it used to be jewish you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
jewish now blacks and	0 0 0 0
yeah	0
and i guess i i guess uh iraqi now is the	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
i know it but	0 0 0 1
law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
and it doesn't become fun anymore	0 1 1 0 0 0
yeah i have a i have a friend she's studying she's going into law another friend going into law and that she's i i i'm really i'm really concerned about you know she's just going to be you know what's going to happen when she gets there	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah you going	0 0 0
you know all of her dreams will be dispelled	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah yeah if if if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
yeah it's i i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
it is	0 0
i i see i see that happening	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah very much so	0 0 0 0
yeah it's it's a lot of that um	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	0
it it was enjoyable for a while um but it's such a grind	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and you begin to wonder you know if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it if	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
um-hum	0
i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard and i aged ten years	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
but i i i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world i mean it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah i i went to a language school and and that was a it was a an i guess uh united states institution it was i was military at the time and i i think probably the biggest	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what branch were you in	0 0 0 0 0
huh	0
what branch were you in	0 0 0 0 0
i was in the air force	0 0 0 0 1 0
i was too	0 0 0
yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
yeah yeah well what was your job	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh uh command post	0 0 0 0
uh i was i was a linguist	1 1 0 0 0 0 1
i was just wondering were you in sac by any chance	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
hum	1
were you in sac	0 0 0 0
in tac	0 0
sac	0
uh no i wasn't	0 0 0 0
oh okay i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh r c one thirty fives	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
no no i didn't i didn't go flight crew matter of fact i didn't make it completely through that through that field i was i was in intelligence school and about three weeks short	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh	0
i didn't make [i]t i sort of washed out	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
well that's	0 0
that's	0
yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it's it's something you know i	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	1
i think that's why you know children really need to think about the field they're going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about they	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	1
they actually should do some reading	0 0 0 1 0 1
that's right and it and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and they should study it	0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
i i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh sure	0 0
i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that's true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at mcdonald's	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
oh and i tell you what i worked at mcdonald's as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some people that i you know you just came to the point where i mean and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a la[b] as a lab technician and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah i was the same way too i'm not a people person i i i hate um having to play such a nice guy you know especially when it's all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
uh-huh	0
i it's just not for me i'm uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that which is why i'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
um-hum	0
yeah that's good i was just wondering um getting back to the school thing so i mean i i i almost wish that there was some	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i'll let you go first	1 1 1 0 1
oh well what's there to say doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
yeah i know what you mean um i in maryland they they do have capital punishment	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and uh i've seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
yeah	0
uh-huh well from what i underst[and] i saw a statistic just a few days ago um so far this ye[ar] year or was it during the last year somewh[ere] during a years time i think it was they executed twenty five people in the nation meanwhile there were twenty five hundred people on death row	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so i i and it's building up you know they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
and uh here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons uh just	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah everybody's got that	0 0 0 0
yeah but i mean in here it's uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes in order to put more people in into the jails and	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
uh-huh	0
and it was just uh amazing to me and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and being rearrested and	0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
isn't isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh i can't remember refresh my memory	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign in the politica[l] in the presidential race uh may it may not have been maryland it may have been massachusetts i don't remember	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
um i don't remember myself	0 0 0 0 1
anyway well the question is you know do you think i[t] it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um i think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis uh that i think it might make a difference right now i don't see it making a difference i	1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
if it	0 0
i don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death i mean most people out there committing murders like don't care	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	0
they just don't care	0 1 0 0
yeah well i think in large measure the reason they don't care it's not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	0
the police don't catch them or the courts don't convict them or or they don't serve very much of the time and so uh you know their their success rate is very high crime does pay ca[sh] you can make a good living at it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah yeah and there's uh there's a lot of people here in baltimore that uh have and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust and of course you know they're they're playing it up real big that it was uh looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
but i mean uh baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year i think they've got over a hundred dead already this year	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
last year it was dc i guess baltimore caught them	0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
well it's kind of it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it uh there's i think x number of people out there that are going to commit murders	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and uh once you kill off a few of them	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
yeah	0
i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to uh i think i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
yeah	0
i mean i i personally think life imprisonment i don't think much of li[fe] of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then why bother just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty so	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah you know it makes sense um you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean uh so few and far between uh you know makes good tv movies and that's about it	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
yeah and and also um the the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened and and base the ver[dict] sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i had my uh my father-in-law participated in a uh a jury trial he was he was actually on the jury	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman um point blank in the face of course he didn't die	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	0
and uh this was during a holdup of a uh uh a restaurant and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies and uh you know jumbo cookies and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
just started shooting people because they botched the first job and	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
you know it's	0 0 0
and so now they're going to get even	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
yeah and get even with who i [laughter-mean] you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
you know stupid guys and uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	0
and of course you know they tried to make the cop look ou[t] like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
i mean it was amazing	0 0 0 0 0
so what was the verdict what was the results there	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh he was found guilty yeah	0 0 1 0 1 0
oh	0
he uh um last i heard he uh he beat a push for the death penalty now whether they finally got it or not i don't know i	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
i kind of uh stopped listening after a while	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to dec[ide] you know after he had to go	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
the the penalty phase yeah they've decide the penalty separately from the verdict	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
right and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just within an hour decided the man's fate	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah well you know you just have to decide you know wha[t] you well yeah there's really two separate decisions there i guess one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
and that w[ill] i i've never been on a jury i've never had that experience i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
hm yeah well it it it went pretty pretty quick from what he said	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
but i mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder i think uh now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something uh it there's uh a death penalty associated with it	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
yeah	0
well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence i mean ye[ah] i can handle people people selling drugs you know it's it's wrong but it it's not worth somebody getting executed for but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah yeah i agree	0 0 0 0
and so i go le[t's] you know these are the kind of people i would like to ye[ah] get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i agree i i've i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh that kind of person and uh as far as uh you know there are some some other crimes that i think uh you know kidnapping um you know when they i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh uh fine and penalty associated with it but	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
but um some of these people are just out and out brutal i some of the cases i've heard about over the years	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
well what would you have at a dinner party	1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1
well uh lately since i have children i've cut down on having dinner parties but	1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
but when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time uh i have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball it's called burgundy meatballs and it's made with r[ed] red wine and um	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
oh gosh that sounds great	1 1 0 1 1
um	0
it's it's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when you're ready to um to serve it	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
uh-huh	1
that's one of my favorite things to to serve	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
sure	1
but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh really well i guess being from that part of the country	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but you know i i wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
but if it was a formal uh dinner party i would probably think of something else like um shrimp shrimp fettucini is real easy to um make and everything and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1
yeah	1
and it's usually well liked by people i guess i'm just a seafood fan so i think on the lines oh	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
well how do you make how do you you cook crawfish i	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i in fact i just came back from the grocery store and being in texas we don't have too many you know people that that eat crawfish but they had live crawfish on sale	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
oh yeah um	0 1 1
um you're not supposed to i mean you're not supposed to eat them_1 dead i mean well you eat them_1 dead but	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
um-hum	1
but	0
don't buy them_1 that way	0 0 0 0 1
right because_1 if if they're dead for too long you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because_1 their tail straightens out	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
uh-huh	1
and you're not supposed to eat those because_1 they're the bad for you	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
okay well i'll remember that	1 0 0 1 1
yeah so if you ever go in a restaurant and order crawfish i mean every once in a while you'll see o[ne] i mean it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then yeah don't eat it	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
but um you just put some cajun well lots of pepper	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	0
and you just boil them and they're absolutely wonderful but there's uh they're a pain to peel for some people once you get used to it they're real easy but um you know if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
when you were um whe[n] when you serve it do you shell them and then serve them to	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i think for a dinner party i i don't know it depends	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	1
like if like my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no i they would shell their own you	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
sure	1
you know we'd just have crawfish and beer or something but um if it was more formal like if i was you know working environment then i would probably um sh[ell] shell them_1 or at least disconnect them from the head but there's a there's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
so they don't have see that ooh	0 0 0 0 1 0 1
so um it it would just depend that's	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's the best part of the crawfish	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
sucking the head but um i don't know it just i[t] it just depended on what type it was i guess but you can buy uh the crawfish tails already peeled an[d] everything and usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um you know make a sauce with or something like that but	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
um-hum	1
but you can go ahead and buy them_1 cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
does it taste a lot like shrimp	0 1 1 0 0 0 1
um yeah it really does i like shrimp better	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
yeah	1
just um but crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own it also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use and stuff like that but	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
sure	1
but um i think that and also to get totally off c[rawfish] the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah we have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
and	1
that's what i need	0 1 0 1
yeah that's what i wish i had but in our family i'm the one who who cooks and i i really enjoy it it's gotten a little more difficult with kids but i really do enjoy cooking and we um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot and	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
oh	1
and we we was	1 0 0 0
was really a lot of fun and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i bet that	0 0 1
and	0
that that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it	0 0
it did and	0 1 1
we we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other or	1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
that would be fun	0 1 0 1
or	1
uh it was a lot of fun you know it something unique you know and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh uh elegant theme or you know	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh huh	0 1
it was a lot of fun	0 0 0 0 0 1
sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
that's right	0 1
well that's you know that's fun	1 1 1 1 0 1
it was fun and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh huh	0 1
that sounds right i would i'd take him up on that	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i'm	1
it does except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to uh make sure that they didn't have to do it again	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	1
maybe i	1 1
make hot dogs or some potato chips or	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i that's about how much i can cook you know	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
i'm i'm doing a lot more cooking now then i used to but	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
but that's only because my mom just started working so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon so i try to have things cooked for her but uh um i usually try to stay out of kitchen	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh that's nice	1 1 0
i don't know	0 0 1
not one of my favorite hobbies	0 0 0 0 0 1
it can it can be fun i if you have the time but you know a lot of times it's too it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she um every christmas and and easter whenever	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce and it has i don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are just absolutely delicious	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
i don't know what she calls them and i don't i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol but	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um	0
i don't know i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it's um it's in the other room i don't know if we have enough time for it it's	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
oh	1
it's real easy one of the unique things in this like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um um what ever seasoning usually just light seasonings	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
seasonings like salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different um	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
oh	1
that would be wonderful	0 0 0 1
makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop them_1 up real fine	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
but um it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it and then the sauce is just made with um bouillon cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	1
oh	1
so it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um chinese food the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	1
and it gives it a bit of a different consistency	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well um how long do you cook the meatballs	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're uh browned on all all sides and	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh huh	0 1
and then drain off all the grease uh then what i usually do is i freeze them and then when you're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it probably	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh	1
yeah	1
probably you have to heat it up for a good oh if they're frozen you know it may take a half hour for them to thaw out but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself let them simmer in the sauce itself	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
hum	0
that's real good	0 0 1
that sounds great especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance i	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
right	1
i mean like if if you are having a dinner party on wednesday night you could do it on a weekend	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and then freeze them	0 0 1 0
sure	1
that would be great i'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because i hope to have lots of dinner parties because_1 i like to	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i mean i'm i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company and i know that my future husband will be you know he's going to be working for chevron in houston so	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
so he's going to be um you know i'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah you'll meet friends invite	0 1 0 1 1
invite invite the boss over and and the friends at work	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah i	0 1 0
i have to impress the boss and clients because_1 um i'm in i'm in public relations in school	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
so i'm going to have you know my whole job's going to be based on my clients an[d] stuff like that so i'm gonna have lots of dinner parties and	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
sure	1
and have to take them_1 out to eat and right now i am taking a class on etiquettcy and all the little bitty things that i didn't even know i	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
oh really	0 1
really	1
i mean i thought for sure i'd been raised properly but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
but i'd been doing a lot of things wrong i didn't know about	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
but um so is there anything else	1 0 1 0 0 0 1
well i i think we've we've covered the subject i've got some interesting information about crawfish i was in fact i	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
it's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh yes	0 1
yes you need to try them_1 oh they're wonderful	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh i will i'm sure my husband will be surprised because_1 we were talking about them the other day even before	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
okay um i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know ti is a very casual atmosphere	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
uh-huh	1
and uh what i usually do on the weekend is is lay out five outfits and uh on monday i i wear the the worst looking one because and it doesn't seem like people are really are you know are that alive on monday you know so	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
so	0
yeah	1
and then progressively through the week i'll i'll wear nicer looking things and then on friday most everybody wears jeans jeans and sweatshirts or you know jeans and blouses or something like that uh but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and uh pullover sweaters or uh you know little two piece dress suit[s] suits like but	0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
yeah uh you know that's a good way to approach it i've never thought about um i do plan my clothes a week in advance actually i plan them a month in advance i usually do a month at a time so i don't repeat an outfit	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but um i've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on monday because really no one's paying attention but anyway um i really i don't work outside of school um i work in the computer lab at school so i can just wear whatever i have on for school and and um and really it's i try to dre[ss] dress presentable but very comfortable	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
right	1
like um in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or or pants i usually um you know college is so casual you really don't want to dress up unless you you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that so	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
right like where i work it's it's pretty casual um it's it's i guess it's more like a a college campus also i mean there's hundre[ds] you know hundreds of people work for ti	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
and um a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time and they dress up like when customers are coming in or uh when we have department meetings or something like that	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
and um you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their the real um higher ups like the the lawy[ers] the ti lawyers and uh those that work for the the higher executives those secretaries they uh they really dress up all the time	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
um-hum	1
oh	1
so there's a good combination in the hallways all the time you know	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
well that's good that they're so casual	0 0 1 0 1 0 0
yeah	0
i mean uh my brother works for ti and he's a computer programmer or computer engineer	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	1 1
and um you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear uh a tie or a dress shirt everyday but uh he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt and tennis shoes and	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
and he just loves it	0 0 0 1 1
and that's very acceptable at ti i	0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
i believe at ibm they they make you wear a blue suit and uh some kind of colored shirt and a tie	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
that's what i've heard	0 0 0 1
uh-huh i wou[ld] i would hate to be in that atmosphere	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
but uh i mean they they just moved into the new building he calls it the new building i don't know it's where all the executives are	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and um and so they were they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans but he just left for italy today at four	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh	1
and he'll be over there until july first setting up some kind of computers for them	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i see	0 1
over in ti mean for ti but over in italy	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah oh ti is everywhere	0 0 0 0 1
oh yeah he was so excited about going	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
but uh he didn't carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude that well if i don't take it then they won't make me wear it	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's true that's a good idea	1 1 0 0 1 0
because_1 uh he just he didn't you know he's not really into all that he would wear it if he had to for his job and all but you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um blue jeans and a t-shirt so	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
but i think that's great about ti and also uh to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff i	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
the no	0 0
right	1
i think that's great	0 0 0 1
yeah and if you happen to go into one of the areas that is a smoke smoke area and you don't smoke you almost strangle	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
oh really do you smoke	0 1 0 0 1
so much smoke in the air yeah areas the smoking area you know it's closed in and	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
and if you don['t] if you don't smoke and you go in there tha[t] everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when when you go in there i used to smoke a long time ago	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
i think that's um	0 1 0 0
i used to burn my clothes talking about getting back to clothes i used to burn my clothes with cigarettes that's one of the reason that i stopped	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well um y[ou] you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

and she you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and uh buys clothes um whe[n] you know when they were coming up i i didn't sew but now i've i've learned how to sew so i'm well i'm i'm still learning how but i'm ge[tting] and i'm getting much better at it and i i'm going to be able to make my own clothes	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's great	0 1
i wanted to take a sewing class at school but i just haven't fit it into my schedule yet but that i mean that can really benefit	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
um that's something that i'd be very interested in very interested in learning	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right because clothes are s[ome] are really expensive you know uh	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
uh they're outrageous	1 0 1
uh uh a little simple shell shell blouse you know that you can make for about say ten dollars at you know at at the most out of a decent fabric boy runs you like twenty something dollars in the store	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
yeah it's it's marked up	1 0 0 0 1
just a little shell to go under a suit you know	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
it is it is really outrageous but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom i never understood this then but i do now but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or um or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that and	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and she always told me it was because i was still growing and she wasn't going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
right especially t[o] to pay that kind of money for it	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
i have a friend who um she had a she had a ba[by] a little boy and uh sh[e] she used to dress him out of neiman marcus i mean she dressed him oh fabulously	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
oh no	0 1
and then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff and	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	1
and she finally learned that you just can not do this you know so now she finds the basement sales and just like you know everybody else	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
that's the best way to shop i mean i always thought my mom was being mean to me but i look back at it now and my child is going to i mean i'm going to raise mine the same way	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
um i don't know i just ah they're just so outrageously priced it's just incredible	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yes and your[self]	1 0 0
i try to uh always catch the sales	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
always	1
and yeah and you just have to keep buying them you know if you if you if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah it it depends on um yeah there's there's always a reason why they're on sale	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
right	1
so that that has a lot to do with it	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	0
but um well	0 0 1
like i bought i bought the most beautiful sw[eater] uh sweater from uh i believe it was ross dress for less	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and it wa[s] it was really pretty it was just you know it was just plain a plain uh ro[und] you know round uh necked uh sw[eater] sweater	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and it had uh like it was embellished around the the top you know it had uh leather leather designs and um some othe[r] other little things on it and i just thought it was so pretty and i go[t] i got it at a real good price i think maybe it was nine ninety nine or something	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
oh that's great	1 0 1
and it was so pretty and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why [laughter-it] [laughter-was] why it was it was so cheap	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
huh oh	0 1
there was in the middle of the back of it there was it's like there it had been slit and they had like just sewed it back together right in the middle of [laughter-the] the back you know wasn't	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
oh no	0 1
wasn't a seam or anything you know	0 0 0 0 1 0 0
uh-huh	1
and that's why it was so cheap although it's not it's not really noticeable um from the outside but but still it's you know it's really not not not a good quality	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
and then i was told by somebody that works for jc penney's that um ross ross is just one of those places that sell[s] sells seconds	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
the defect	0 1
yeah yeah um they don't really buy the first quality they buy the [laughter-second] and uh places like jc penney's that they'll reject the seconds they'll send them back every time but	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
but places like ross dress for less and uh tj max	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
tj max does that yeah	0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
yeah we have a tj max over here and um	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
you want to start	1 0 1 1
well i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
yeah	1
um i am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in both in society and in the work place uh there's no doubt about the fact that when i f[irst] was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily uh now i think the change that i've seen as much as anything is one where couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to sh[are] both share homemaking duties and also how women will uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place	1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
i	0
and i guess that's a significant change that of i've both participated in an[d] and noticed	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
i agree um the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
um i have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother go uh and the children are left without either parent now to me that's kind of a drawback but uh i guess it's a price you pay and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the uh uh day care centers	1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
wonder about them in what way	0 1 0 0 0 1
well uh from what i understand there's been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious uh they term it as more uh creative but uh that they uh are much more contentious	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
so i i don't i i guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up you know in in a kind of a uh community rather than a home	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
i have not to be honest had much experience with children in that situation i	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
i i guess one knows one's own story and i know uh in my children's case it was one where uh pretty much up until the older of two was in uh let's see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
um	1
so they	0 1
so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
they were able to be home together um and we never actually experienced that what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next generation or so i guess i anticipate um an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum uh-huh	0 1
um i don't know whether there will be an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see i just don't know	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
what do you mean	0 0 0 1
um deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother	1 0 1 0 0 1
oh yeah	1 1
sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh uh whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um a professional mother a person for instance that	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
that's strange	1 1
a nanny sort of	0 1 1 0
uh-huh uh-huh	0 1
uh-huh	1
and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh uh story or whatever i	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
i i don't think i have a philosophical problem with that in fact i think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
that's right that's right	0 1 0 1
uh um i i don't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on the var[ious] on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not uh i know that that my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent i i don't know that i uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
uh i don't have boys that doesn't didn't bother me never has vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes uh a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh	1 0
it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
um i know that there are young people characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means they're young uh that in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child i	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum um-hum	1 0
to come in and live with them_1	0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i could easily envision that pardon	0 0 0 1 0 1
to come in and live with them_1	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
or to put their child into a s[etting] into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	1
and and you were paying for really high quality care	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
right	1
uh i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that's what the experience they want and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum um-hum	0 0
i know the day care centers are not cheap either you know they're	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
i haven't ever really looked at them are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh well no i	0 1 1 0
i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it they have to go with the a single uh wh[at] i mean a babysitter more more or less	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
but i think it's like about sixty dollars a week for two children if i'm not mistaken	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and you have to pay that whether you're on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
uh-huh	1
i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay and uh	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
what what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh i think i really don't have a vision	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
that's okay too	0 1 1
[laughter-yeah] i um i think that they will be more in the work place because uh the door's open	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	1
and uh it's just human nature to walk through an open door so and i would be glad to see that i hope i don't see a lot more single moms but i it seems in my experience i'm running across single women all the time	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
i'm i'm noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place and	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah	1
and that that is a little troublesome uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
yeah yeah	1 1
it's awful	0 1
yeah	1
uh and maybe that's a change we'll see maybe uh p[ossibility] the possibility of of women uh who deliberately say no we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
right	1
so	1
well i think we've done it	1 0 0 0 1 0
well i think we're about done okay	1 0 1 0 1 0 1
thank you very much it's	0 0 0 1 0
uh good bye	0 0 1
it's been interesting	0 0 1
you take care	0 1 0
okay	1
bye	1
bye	1
okay	1
so are you a freshwater or	1 0 1 1 1 1
mostly freshwater uh	0 1 1
freshwater	1
yeah i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in galveston with my parents and i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to to do anything and i didn't know anybody who had a boat now so i don't fish too much in saltwater	1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum most of my fishing has been in the saltwater huh mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
oh really	0 1
oh neat	1 1
and uh huh i have caught one or two small sharks	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
oh really	1 1
and uh yes	1 0 1
what'd you do with them	0 0 0 1 1
put them [laughter-back]	0 0 1
you didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
no no no i love shark steak but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything uh	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
do they have a limit on sharks i mean is that like a a sport fish can you actually catch those and there's no limit	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1

well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
um-hum	0
and um most of it i haven't been really in a long time last time i went i actually was in galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

i don't i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i wanna i want to say i brought something [laughter-home] i	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the last time i went uh bass fishing uh i was with my daughter a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter we i was the only one who did not catch a single fish	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
really	1
my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
he caught fish	0 0 1
everybody but you	0 0 1
i did not even i did not even i have been i was out on a party boat a few years ago and we we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing everyone on the boat was catching snapper snappers except guess who	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0
it had to be you	0 0 0 0 1
i co[uld] [laughter-i]	1 0 1
couldn't catch one to save your life [laughter-right]	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
that's right i would go from one side of the boat to the other and uh the uh the party boat captain could not understand you know	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
he even even he started baiting my hook and holding holding the uh the fishing rod	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
how funny just hoping maybe he could fool them_1	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
right and it was it was really really really bad uh i as i said i am a fisher i'm not a catcher	1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
but uh i enjoy it though i don't really get out as much as i uh as i would like too	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
and uh they do of course you know here in um we're only just a you know few not a few minutes we're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
right	1
and they do a lot of fishing there of course what i used to like to do though is uh go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh or oy[ster] for oysters	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
oh yeah	1 1
that would be fun	0 0 0 1
and uh that i was able to do uh when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the [laughter-bottom]	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
right	1
hand picked	0 1
[laughter-that's] [laughter-right]	1 1
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh rockport which is close to corpus	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area and uh we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything and something i had a rock to weight it down something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
i'm i'm sure it's not a fish right and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life it had real teeth like human teeth and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it's mouth it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
hm	0
they say it's a dogfish from everything i've described it was brown with these little white dots	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
it it was the strangest thing it oh i'll never get over that to this day i don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i'm sure one of those fish are there	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well we used to i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is uh in some of the inlets and the rivers around rehoboth delaware	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
um-hum	1
they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker i don't know if you've ever heard of it	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i've never heard of that one	0 0 0 0 0 1
and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
that's where it gets its name obviously huh	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
um-hum and this is the ugliest fish i have ever seen and	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
and i me[an] and they come in all si[ze] you know i've i've caught them from you know three or four inches long up to uh	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
um-hum	0
i guess the la[rgest] largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
huh	1
can you eat them	0 0 1 0
no no	1 1
ooh i i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly but	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
that's like this dogfish it was it scared me to death	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	0
it was u[gly] it really it didn't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
well the first time i went uh surf fishing was in and i threw my line out and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or uh two feet long	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
and scared me to death	0 0 0 0 1
oh	0
i i had never seen anything and then i was fi[shed] fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth and then i felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here i'm really going to get one	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
and i pulled	1 0 1
okay this topic is is russia a threat to our security i think they're more of a threat to their own people at this day and time how do you feel about it	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
well they do have uh a major internal problem everybody wants to defect and i can understand why um i think their biggest problem is just you know obtaining food to live so when you have the basic needs uh being unmet i don't think you think globally as far as you know being a threat to other people in the world	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
so as soon as they get their their own home country taken care of then they'll consider what they can do with the rest of the world	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
i believe communism is very much waning it's uh pretty much on the way out of the door in so far as the strong hold that they used to have and the russian people are all realizing that the communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world and their rebellions right now is the result of that i[f] if they can get the army or the military to sway to their side i think that uh it will be on the way out eventually	0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
it's just a matter of time because in the baltic states they've already massacred so many people who protested and	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
and that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy for the regarding the uh outcome of their affairs what's your synopsis	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
well i do i do realize that um uh the bush administration isn't too happy with with how they're handling their internal um strife you know as far as diplomacy is concerned i think it's been a good a good uh positive direction for um the soviets as far as yeltsin is concerned you know he was um allowed to what wh[at] in his in the in the congress they they gave him more power as far as his republic in russia is concerned which is gives him more power overall which i think is a good sign that there'll be some you know politically speaking you know he's going to have more power and i think it's a step in the right direction i think gorbachev realizes that he's got a a major uh uh power figure you know competing against him and i think it's gonna be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with yeltsin as far as uh realizing well he does realize it you know with the fact that they reduced the uh or they increased the prices on their food food and goods	1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
uh-huh i	1 1
uh it yeah	0 1 1
i think that it went up a thousand percent on most	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah tha[t's] that's incredible but they had to um go in the direction of a market driven economy and and they had to bite the bullet for that so that's a good move on on gorbachev's part in doing that	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
um-hum	1
so	1
but gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that he's moving towards a two to three party system of government that nor eliminating or diminishing the communist power	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
and i guess that's where yeltsin steps in so far as his politics of government goes uh but i don't know how convinced the people are of him yet myself	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
well that's all they got right now that's their ray of hope	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
so you know they'll go with you know w[ho] whoever comes through for them i	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
i it it's just that w[hat] the weird thing is is that gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates as far as with glasnost and [poistroi[ka]-/perestroika] perestroika and stuff and	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
and i think he's caught between the old guard and and the new uh glasnost um i think it's kind of uh escalate to a point where it's out of control	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	1
and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how in order to keep the peace on peace on both sides so i think that's where you know kind of where he's stuck you know what i'm saying	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah uh i understand it	1 0 0 1 0
and that's the that's the situation that he finds himself in and you know he's a tough guy i mean he's been through it so i have no doubt that he'll i mean y[ou] i i think overall he's been a a good ah figure for the the soviet union i mean i think his intentions and his ideals are are uh well intentioned	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and in the long-term but i just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have i think that that makes the problem most severe and makes him look look worse that what his um what his ideals are personally	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
i agree what's bad for the soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
i think it's i think it's a lot of uh oh how do you put it bureaucracy and and and uh one thing and then all the corruption i think there's a a a large amount of corruption on the the have and the have nots you know i	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah that's probably more true than a lot of people realize	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i i know you're going to have that with every society at	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
at least we're more blatant about it but it's very secret and it's been going on for years i mean you can't change things overnight	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
uh-huh	0
and but if it gets to a point where people can't survive i mean there's revolution you know and that's	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
it seems to be headed in that direction too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
[laughter-yeah] big time major but you know that's that's what happens when you know the cork blows and you can't handle it anymore i mean that's that's the way the world uh you know revolves that way	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
uh-huh well their knowledge with uh better communication processes in this world now that's reached them is more educated than to the uh ways of the western world	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
i really question though how much technology the average soviet is exposed to	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
and um i think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things to	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
they probably not enough but i'm sure i lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind of what they're missing out on	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i think they're starting to realize but i i just don't think they have the resources if you were to compare uh the americans to the soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines fax machines and cellular phones and state of the art equipment that we are so used to i don't think they even realize what's out there and to what extent	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah i'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
yeah all the major conveniences of life	1 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah what we consider just i don't [laughter-know] normal everyday things to them is real luxury which is unfortunate for them	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and of course most of us we don't really appreciate what we've got because we've been so used to it	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
this is true this is very true and we it's human it's human nature though to take things for granted and it kind of you know when	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
when you've lost something or or uh uh don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize you know what's out there and what you know what you have and what you don't have	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i agree	0 0 1
so the original question do we think they're a threat to our you know a s[ecurity] s[ecurity] security threat	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
um yes and no	0 0 0 1
yeah i can go with that answer too the only yes i could go to is if uh a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching of something to that effect to for to a nuclear exchange but i don't even see that occurring uh because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to i guess	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
um no	0 1
well i don't really feel that the soviets really want to blow up the world i mean um we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as as nonfeeling machine type people and they're people just like us i mean you know they get up everyday and	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
and they put their pants on the same way and they have to eat and everything else and i just don't feel that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
it's it's hard to[pic] topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or state school	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
okay but you're excluding high-level education	0 1 1 1 0 1
yes well yeah i am um	0 0 1 1 0 1
okay	0
act[ually] actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in new york city or washington dc uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to arkansas and texas after living in ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
well that's really too bad because i[t] it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in florida	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
right	0
what we learned	0 0 0
well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done because we were so far advanced	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
and uh the you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	0
so you know i i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh they they have that down there that	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools but uh you know	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
right	0
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there's no point in you know i'm an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them_1 and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
right in high school	0 0 0 0
so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
right	0
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there to socialize not really to learn and	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
and	0
right	0
and the parents send them_1 there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them_1 just want to go play	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if they're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
yeah that's true i'm wondering with the boom down here it's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
yes are they going to move to uh mexico	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so	0
oh i don't know about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now we're we're we're behind down here	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
i say we because_1 i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them you know if the industry comes hopefully they'll promote good schools	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	0
because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large ibm plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1
right	0
they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
you hope	0 0
yeah you hope well i think i i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in i can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader i don't see where she's going to have much time for him so i don't know it's just like	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the govern[ment] the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from is it you know what	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t[o] to see what they need and not overinflate it	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	0
we're in a recession here we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah	0
so	0
starts hitting closer to home	0 0 0 0 1
yeah but i always see it's all it's all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime it it's it's all money based and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school who knows bu[t] maybe we do we need some more catholic schools support the church instead they seem to have done a the good job in the past in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school so	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah they're a lot more strict	0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah the i don't	0 0 0 0
you uh have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
yeah i don't know if i would do that to my [laughter-child] [laughter-though] but so hum pretty much though see i don't have any good ideas or or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the university of texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
is it	0 0
i i don't think i'm getting what i should but you know in texas it's next to free because th[ey] they pay so much of it it's state supported	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
well that	0 0
but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to mit my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of mit and that's it's really too bad	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
well	0
but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and col[lege] junior colleges that don't have the background for an mit kind of curriculum so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's it's university of vermont um we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
the aids issue is is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more peo[ple] mean more people than aids and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded aids has more money than uh breast cancer	1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
and well that's interesting isn't it yeah	1 1 1 0 0 0 0
so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh it's just one big pr campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to aids and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
right	1
and it's just one of those well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded and uh having thought about that for a while	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
what did you think about that idea	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i go[t] i got to thinking the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood an[tigen] antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
they've not really given it attention either yeah	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
so it's not really cure f[or] yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it through different organizations march of dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever um illness they wish	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
right	1
it's kind of hard to to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
well i'm i'm glad i'm not the one that's that's in charge of of making those decisions they uh you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because_1 they're all so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden it's the most important thing	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
right	1
so i i would hate to have that responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address i uh i guess i it it frightens me to think of so many people with with aids and with cancer and many of those things um if they're not able to to be insured then the country's gonna pay for it one way or the other whether it's through prevention or or treatment or you know just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
right	1
it seems like one way or the other we're gonna end up paying for it	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
that's true	0 1
just	1
you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a a unfair advantage as they were but	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
but the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but we have such an affluent [s]ociety society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
just change our p[riorities]	1 1 0 0
of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but [laughter-that's]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
right just change our priorities a little bit and	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but are they that enhancing for the m[asses] for the masses you know they	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
right	1
they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
so well you['re] you['re] you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose	1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last genera[tion] well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1
uh-huh	1
well take it back thirty years i'm going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home period an[d]	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
yeah	1
and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
yeah	1
if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it until the kids you were little	1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
yeah you you weren't supposed to want a job	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
and then and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah	1
and and we have these wonderful people who are who are totally prepared to tea[ch] to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
yeah but but but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and and uh we'll see how the generations go huh	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did i've	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
i've i was an engineer with uh mechanical engineer with t i and uh i did it for six years and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old and and it just drove me crazy	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
did you	0 0
i could not do either well enou[gh] i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess[ary] or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as is you know as is needed and because my husband had had for a long time was out of the country also with uh with work for like three months and	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
oh yeah	0 1
and and	0 0
so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're going to be there	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah it might have been better	1 0 0 1 1 1
yeah	1
but uh if you're going to be more pro[fessional] professional oriented then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that that doesn't really go with the family	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once	1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
um-hum so you figure one of these days	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
you're going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
i'm i'm i'm a photographer now	0 1 0 0 1 1
oh okay you've found something else	0 0 0 0 0 1
i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
and i'm i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else to do	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
yeah and it['s] it's great while they're really little but as they get older and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
um-hum	1
i mean it he goes to a a mother's day out program now once a week both of my kids do and so they're getting they they get the socialization with other kids and y[ou] you know and not really school but but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah i think they do too	0 1 0 0 1 0
and i need it for the break	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
um-hum	1
and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and and if it's not if it's not mom then then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
and enjoy it that's that's the whole thing	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten year[s] even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
because if if i if i had been allowed to work you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
because i liked my job really well	1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy and now with the photography that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and and use those hours to do the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
the the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
uh-huh	0
yeah	0
um-hum	0
so my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if it's you know an[d] an[d] when he's at home can take care of them	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
yeah	1
it's going to have to be both	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father's attitudes about you know who[se] whose job is this	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
well it['s] it's his job too and i to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to so uh	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
it's just convincing your husband that's important or that that that it's important enough for him to do it	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
yeah to yeah to m[e]	1 0 1 0 0
yeah well	1 1
because if he saw mom doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it in that other you know uh that i should do it or tha[t] or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it i	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
and you you you	0 0 0 1
yeah you talk yeah	1 0 1 1
yeah	1
i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
yeah	1
this is what you do it now [laughter-no]	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this and i agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yes and	1 1
and and that's a very hard attitude to change	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
yeah and without and and it's just they don't look at things most men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
um-hum	0
they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be do[ne] this is the time this needs to be done but	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
hm uh um-hum yeah	0 0 1 1
and	0
but	0
and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas to so that they know that uh you know male and female are both responsible for doing this and	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
that's right	0 1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
um-hum	0
and and uh	0 1 0
and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
uh-huh	0
	
you both got to they were both working at whatever things were needed to be done they're	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
um-hum	0
um-hum	0
they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
yeah	1
yeah	1
but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and it's gonna it's gonna yeah	0 0 1 0 1 1
and i i think that's happened in a lot of cases	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah some kids are really having it if they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't yeah the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum um you know some time day care is really good but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
but sometimes it's just it's baby sitting	0 0 0 1 0 1 0
yeah	1
it's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any relationship with the adults to say you know here's what's right and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah	1
and here's what's wrong and and here's what we expect of you	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little you know this	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah	1
this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because_1 i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum	0
but if no one does anything when they're little then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
yeah i'm i'm saying this as i'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yes i understand i i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah well she's usually in bed by this time but she's staying up late tonight but yeah you know i want to i want to have a relationship with her you know m[y] my dad was a very traditional dad and when i was a child i didn't really know my dad very well and i miss that and i want	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
yeah the men have to be convinced of that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work but i think if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
no	1
i know i know mine almost never did	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
