sw2604B-ms98-a-0023	sw02604-B_017160-018204	back in the depression the ccc the the construction corps that went out and did things that was great it was needed it gave folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2604B-ms98-a-0024	sw02604-B_018204-018872	um i don't see that as being necessary now i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
sw2604B-ms98-a-0025	sw02604-B_018872-019560	uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1

sw2604B-ms98-a-0027	sw02604-B_020085-021087	but i see i i see so much going on that that's bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem something that they turn back	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1

sw2604B-ms98-a-0030	sw02604-B_022419-023401	and i i see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives it may not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1

sw2708B-ms98-a-0019	sw02708-B_008087-008763	well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like um the prisoners make	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
sw2708B-ms98-a-0020	sw02708-B_008763-009876	license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
sw2708B-ms98-a-0021	sw02708-B_009876-010854	rather than sitting there it's the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the united states i feel the same way	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
sw2708B-ms98-a-0022	sw02708-B_010854-011634	uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
sw2708B-ms98-a-0024	sw02708-B_011760-012130	so it's self defen[se] you know self-defense on that point	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1

sw2708B-ms98-a-0041	sw02708-B_020915-021847	to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1

sw2708B-ms98-a-0046	sw02708-B_023075-023975	which of course again which m[ean] would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2708B-ms98-a-0047	sw02708-B_023975-024171	but that would come down	0 0 1 0 1

sw2717B-ms98-a-0065	sw02717-B_030680-031961	the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1

sw2759A-ms98-a-0020	sw02759-A_006628-007454	well uh uh i i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0

sw2759A-ms98-a-0022	sw02759-A_007814-008518	i i know the the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0023	sw02759-A_008518-009145	that are specifically drug and alcohol related and it's like in the billions of dollars every year	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0024	sw02759-A_009145-009909	um and th[e] the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0025	sw02759-A_009909-010351	and you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0026	sw02759-A_010351-011633	like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it but c[ould] you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0

sw2759A-ms98-a-0042	sw02759-A_015870-016652	yeah well and it's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0043	sw02759-A_016652-017405	if somebody else is impaired because generally you know it um you find out one way or another	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0044	sw02759-A_017405-017686	if somebody's got a problem on the job	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0045	sw02759-A_017686-018916	and if e[ven] even if like you say even if it's just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers then it it's still a problem	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0046	sw02759-A_018916-019040	so	0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0049	sw02759-A_020841-021094	well yeah i guess it comes with the turf	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1

sw2759A-ms98-a-0052	sw02759-A_021573-021813	i[n] i[n] in terms of	0 0 0 1 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0053	sw02759-A_021813-022087	drugs they're illegal so you're	1 0 1 0 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0054	sw02759-A_022087-022306	you're breaking the law anyway	0 1 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0055	sw02759-A_022306-022965	um probably the the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0056	sw02759-A_022965-023276	and that's probably the biggest problem there is	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0059	sw02759-A_024534-024659	yeah	0

sw2759A-ms98-a-0062	sw02759-A_025061-025882	well i guess that's one of the positive things that ha[s] has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0063	sw02759-A_025882-026634	they will give you an opp[ortunity] o[pportunity] opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0064	sw02759-A_026634-026809	and i th[ink]	0 1 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0065	sw02759-A_026809-027226	yeah and i think the benef[its] the company benefits in the long run	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0068	sw02759-A_027953-028357	what what kind of testing do they do when you went	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1

sw2759A-ms98-a-0077	sw02759-A_030978-031401	there there are people that kn[ow] pay other people for that	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0078	sw02759-A_031401-031532	to help them out	0 1 0 0

sw2759A-ms98-a-0082	sw02759-A_032171-032295	yeah	1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0084	sw02759-A_032424-033302	yeah it depends r[eally] r[eally] really on how how strong a test it is they've got different degrees as far as as how far back they can check	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0085	sw02759-A_033302-034098	they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests they've they've got some companies that are doing um hair tests	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0086	sw02759-A_034098-034625	yeah well that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0087	sw02759-A_034625-034753	um	0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0088	sw02759-A_034753-035019	back a certain period of time	1 0 0 0 0 1
sw2759A-ms98-a-0090	sw02759-A_035190-035725	um because um some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0092	sw02759-A_035839-036182	hair follicles i guess are just dead protein and they	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0093	sw02759-A_036182-036678	and it it's apparently al[most] almost like a a calendar they they've got it	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw2759A-ms98-a-0094	sw02759-A_036678-037661	pretty precise now that they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and and that type of thing	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

sw2759A-ms98-a-0099	sw02759-A_038324-039231	so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

sw2836A-ms98-a-0003	sw02836-A_001007-002173	uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how about_1 you	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

sw2836A-ms98-a-0012	sw02836-A_009092-010168	about_1 fifteen miles i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0013	sw02836-A_010168-011023	but it's pretty congested we are considered in the country but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country our major crimes in our immediate	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0014	sw02836-A_011023-011482	town uh is probably robberies house robberies	1 0 0 1 0 1 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0015	sw02836-A_011482-012343	and very few instances of you know alcohol drug uh reported however i'm sure they're there	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0016	sw02836-A_012343-013531	but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0017	sw02836-A_013531-014306	and since that time everybody's gotten some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0018	sw02836-A_014306-015165	uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices the sensors and things like that it's cut back	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0019	sw02836-A_015165-016206	you know considerably but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0021	sw02836-A_016382-017420	uh i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0022	sw02836-A_017420-018633	most well most families most families they are young and both people are working so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work uh so uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0023	sw02836-A_018633-019527	i would say that's probably their prime motivation they'll s[talk] they'll stalk your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0024	sw02836-A_019527-021012	um they classify most of them_1 as professionals uh you get a few of them_1 that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0026	sw02836-A_021144-022449	probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for uh jewelry	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0027	sw02836-A_022449-022893	are the major targets guns that sort of stuff	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0028	sw02836-A_022893-023296	very few you know penny penny ante stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0030	sw02836-A_023569-024914	well uh the police force for one i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use uh it's oh right now i think uh we're about	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0031	sw02836-A_024914-025939	thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many and	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0033	sw02836-A_027287-028256	well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0034	sw02836-A_028256-028885	yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0035	sw02836-A_028885-029449	uh but for the that would be certainly be a deterrent	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0036	sw02836-A_029449-030613	and uh not necessarily you know uh give in to their uh human rights desires you know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them_1 in there till they just suffocate uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0038	sw02836-A_030792-031838	uh i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof uh	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0040	sw02836-A_032011-033159	i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0041	sw02836-A_033159-033917	to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0042	sw02836-A_033917-035402	especially you you know in the case of murder uh i know in my case i ha[d] my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five and we caught the individuals got caught we uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0043	sw02836-A_035402-036594	we went through the court system and all that sort of thing and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0044	sw02836-A_036594-037562	uh you know the the guy only got five years and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system so what what	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0045	sw02836-A_037562-037741	do what now	0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0047	sw02836-A_037885-038289	n[o] no i'm not real familiar with that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0049	sw02836-A_038509-038661	oh	0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0050	sw02836-A_038661-039642	well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him and they said well you know he they're he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that that you could go after	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0052	sw02836-A_039918-040353	yeah uh very seldom	0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0053	sw02836-A_040353-041073	yeah they don't do that here course they pay them but they don't you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0054	sw02836-A_041073-042160	and uh you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after them_1 because they're you know they're they're repeat offenders they uh they've been in jail before they've been released you know several times which is another	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0055	sw02836-A_042160-043512	uh deal i hate to see but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and uh and car theft on top of it and destroys my car he we're out you know uh you know	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0056	sw02836-A_043512-044529	fifteen thousand dollars and you know the guy gets out in two months and he goes out and commits it again fact he's back in jail now so what what uh	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0057	sw02836-A_044529-044881	yeah what what deterrent does he really have	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0058	sw02836-A_044881-046153	and i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility uh we've had a couple instances where break-ins where the the people have actually you know	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0059	sw02836-A_046153-046713	shot the people and uh return offenders have	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0060	sw02836-A_046713-048067	they've actually waited for them_1 where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else and try to take it in their own hands course it doesn't always work out in their favor	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0061	sw02836-A_048067-048877	but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us you can you know you can get some of us you can't get all of us	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0062	sw02836-A_048877-049432	uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0064	sw02836-A_049790-049945	yeah	0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0066	sw02836-A_050069-051036	yeah that's i mean that's certainly a a possibility an[d] an[d] we have had a a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0067	sw02836-A_051036-052015	and uh it helps for a while but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0068	sw02836-A_052015-053127	uh i would say probably eighty percent of them_1 that are caught they're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas you know across the the border	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw2836A-ms98-a-0069	sw02836-A_053127-054207	so you know people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever it's not many from the local communities but uh	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0070	sw02836-A_054207-055014	it's a problem and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties would be a definite deterrent and	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
sw2836A-ms98-a-0071	sw02836-A_055014-056005	and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1

sw2836B-ms98-a-0005	sw02836-B_002933-003606	crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but i i think with the current war on drugs	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw2836B-ms98-a-0006	sw02836-B_003606-004768	and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution um and sale of drugs	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1

sw2836B-ms98-a-0011	sw02836-B_007050-007745	but i do have friends who live in the city and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1

sw3925A-ms98-a-0009	sw03925-A_003632-004377	that's an int[eresting] yeah that's interesting i had read something one time and it was just applying to governments in general it was written many years ago	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
sw3925A-ms98-a-0010	sw03925-A_004377-004674	it said that is impossible to have	0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw3925A-ms98-a-0011	sw03925-A_004674-005615	a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers	0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
sw3925A-ms98-a-0012	sw03925-A_005615-005846	and i thought that was interesting	1 0 0 0 0 1
sw3925A-ms98-a-0013	sw03925-A_005846-006574	it wasn't just talking about our government it was just government in general from times past you know on and	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw3925A-ms98-a-0015	sw03925-A_006757-007697	right and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for pub[lic] for but because they wanna be of service to us	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0

sw3925A-ms98-a-0025	sw03925-A_010856-012243	and they talked uh the other let's see third question was how m[uch] how much self-serving for their own gains do you think goes on then they that's hard to answ[er] i'm sure there's a lot but i agree with you there's a lot in business i think that's just	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0

sw4090A-ms98-a-0015	sw04090-A_005107-005795	well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw4090A-ms98-a-0016	sw04090-A_005795-006597	we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw4090A-ms98-a-0017	sw04090-A_006597-006965	and then we divvy them up between	1 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw4090A-ms98-a-0018	sw04090-A_006965-008211	our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1

sw4090A-ms98-a-0020	sw04090-A_008586-009432	and then um we don't have a lot ex[tra] extra for extra spending so it's pretty well earmarked	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
sw4090A-ms98-a-0021	sw04090-A_009432-010286	yeah ev[ery] every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw4090A-ms98-a-0022	sw04090-A_010286-010832	and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
sw4090A-ms98-a-0023	sw04090-A_010832-011841	found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
sw4090A-ms98-a-0024	sw04090-A_011841-012640	um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

sw4090A-ms98-a-0036	sw04090-A_016624-017341	where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the s[ame] the same frustration before you got on a budget but	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw4090A-ms98-a-0037	sw04090-A_017341-018394	you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
sw4090A-ms98-a-0038	sw04090-A_018394-018898	huh and also we have found that if we write down	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
sw4090A-ms98-a-0039	sw04090-A_018898-019809	a[nd] and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0

sw4096A-ms98-a-0006	sw04096-A_001242-001897	i was kind of interested to hear because_1 they had some people from the epa and lots of different places	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0007	sw04096-A_001897-002107	and uh	0 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0008	sw04096-A_002107-002289	they	1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0009	sw04096-A_002289-003008	had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0011	sw04096-A_003399-003679	well it's not too new	1 0 1 0 0

sw4096A-ms98-a-0015	sw04096-A_004457-004924	they really didn't propose any solutions actually they were	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0016	sw04096-A_004924-005415	the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the epa	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0017	sw04096-A_005415-005847	but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0018	sw04096-A_005847-006375	things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0019	sw04096-A_006375-006553	and uh	0 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0020	sw04096-A_006553-007371	uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print and he was talking about um	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0022	sw04096-A_007473-007982	the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0023	sw04096-A_007982-009081	and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0025	sw04096-A_011310-011990	yeah we're doing some here in in cash valley the community here there's uh	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0026	sw04096-A_011990-012350	we've actually got a kind of a nice set up we've got a	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0027	sw04096-A_012350-012788	couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0028	sw04096-A_012788-013283	and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0029	sw04096-A_013283-013683	a fire hazard and make it into insulation	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0030	sw04096-A_013683-014541	and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them_1 because they're actually buying it and shipping it in from outside	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0032	sw04096-A_014649-015268	so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0034	sw04096-A_015368-015831	get some sort of business to actually want it once you've collected it	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0036	sw04096-A_018309-018443	um-hum	0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0038	sw04096-A_019934-020469	and there's a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0039	sw04096-A_020469-021267	and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0040	sw04096-A_021267-021798	oh i can't remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0041	sw04096-A_021798-022591	how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0042	sw04096-A_022591-023024	and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0043	sw04096-A_023024-023522	and it was really quite amazing because_1 he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them_1	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0044	sw04096-A_023522-024083	he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0045	sw04096-A_024083-024510	it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0046	sw04096-A_024510-025559	and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there's a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it to produce electricity	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
sw4096A-ms98-a-0047	sw04096-A_025559-025950	so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0049	sw04096-A_026346-027066	yeah and it's more than even paper or something like that there's more energy in it per pound or whatever	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
sw4096A-ms98-a-0050	sw04096-A_027066-028144	well that was he didn't deal with that he just said burn it he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so it's not very practical is it	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0

sw4108A-ms98-a-0081	sw04108-A_029420-029553	right	1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0001	sw04108-B_000000-000124	okay	1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0003	sw04108-B_000703-001143	well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0004	sw04108-B_001143-001934	uh sometimes it is there's no alternative uh you do not have uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0005	sw04108-B_001934-002692	uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family that is uh	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0006	sw04108-B_002692-002969	in and who around	0 0 0 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0007	sw04108-B_002969-004254	so sometimes it's not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0008	sw04108-B_004254-005105	um especially after if it's after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0009	sw04108-B_005105-005883	sometimes you know it sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0011	sw04108-B_006014-006948	um-hum because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them_1 out much faster than what they're really able to	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0012	sw04108-B_006948-008035	but so so there is some good to it uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job you know the fam[ilies] well the families do not necessarily	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0013	sw04108-B_008035-008648	uh know what to do with them_1 and they don't wanna take the responsibility so they will put them_1 in a nursing home	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0014	sw04108-B_008648-009194	so you see uh there's both sides to it too what do you think	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0016	sw04108-B_009930-010043	yeah	1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0018	sw04108-B_011138-011298	that's true	0 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0020	sw04108-B_011901-012839	well i think that's also where you're gonna to have a lot of people who are going to it's there's not a choice it's because_1 there it's not economically feasible even to put them_1 in a nursing home	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0021	sw04108-B_012839-013514	so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either medicare or insurance to cover it	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0022	sw04108-B_013514-013668	so	0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0024	sw04108-B_014322-014781	yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0025	sw04108-B_014781-015369	i know some el[derly] unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0026	sw04108-B_015369-015854	i guess it's alzheimer's or where they wander or or um	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0028	sw04108-B_015963-016242	confused or have some mental problems	1 0 0 0 1 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0029	sw04108-B_016242-017250	and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0030	sw04108-B_017250-017716	yeah so so there's different types of nursing homes i think	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0032	sw04108-B_019094-019217	um-hum	0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0034	sw04108-B_021878-022451	gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0036	sw04108-B_024260-025053	that's right and i i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0037	sw04108-B_025053-025462	so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0039	sw04108-B_026814-027215	yeah i think i think of the um	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0040	sw04108-B_027215-028320	i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw4108B-ms98-a-0041	sw04108-B_028320-028827	and the family that's going to be uh effec[ted] effected by it	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
sw4108B-ms98-a-0042	sw04108-B_028827-029831	and uh you know sometimes it can those choi[ces] those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when they're	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
sw4127A-ms98-a-0005	sw04127-A_000343-000700	okay i thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1

sw4346B-ms98-a-0013	sw04346-B_006399-007289	well yeah it it's it's pretty much what i was going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
sw4346B-ms98-a-0014	sw04346-B_007289-007887	um i grew up in new york and um the place or not new york city upstate new york	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
sw4346B-ms98-a-0015	sw04346-B_007887-008718	and i went to uh the city of rochester school district and s[o] a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
sw4346B-ms98-a-0016	sw04346-B_008718-009312	and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
sw4346B-ms98-a-0017	sw04346-B_009312-010383	the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw4346B-ms98-a-0018	sw04346-B_010383-011359	and that would result in some um could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw4346B-ms98-a-0019	sw04346-B_011359-012004	and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
sw4346B-ms98-a-0020	sw04346-B_012004-013357	as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior as some other schools had	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw4346B-ms98-a-0021	sw04346-B_013357-014465	and uh it it so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
sw4346B-ms98-a-0022	sw04346-B_014465-015789	of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
sw4346B-ms98-a-0023	sw04346-B_015789-016655	or they'll move farther away to get better schools so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of	1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0

sw4646A-ms98-a-0006	sw04646-A_001710-002895	uh wife's grandmother had alzheimer's and they were going to put her into a a nursing home and uh	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
sw4646A-ms98-a-0008	sw04646-A_003019-003554	they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
sw4646A-ms98-a-0009	sw04646-A_003554-004779	take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance i mean sh[e] she sort of went you know bananas and they couldn't couldn't deal with her	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
sw4646A-ms98-a-0010	sw04646-A_004779-005769	so i guess you need to uh know whether it's a you know no deposit no return kind of thing whether	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0

sw4646A-ms98-a-0017	sw04646-A_007775-008518	my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that um there was a retirement hotel and then a uh	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
sw4646A-ms98-a-0018	sw04646-A_008518-009214	there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it so for	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
sw4646A-ms98-a-0019	sw04646-A_009214-010134	um the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw4646A-ms98-a-0020	sw04646-A_010134-011120	and then um as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
sw4646A-ms98-a-0021	sw04646-A_011120-011746	um provide full-time care and um she didn't have to do anything anymore	0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw4646A-ms98-a-0022	sw04646-A_011746-012525	but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly and that's	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
sw4646A-ms98-a-0023	sw04646-A_012525-013173	some i don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
sw4646A-ms98-a-0024	sw04646-A_013173-014176	what the what the reason is but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

sw4646A-ms98-a-0031	sw04646-A_015328-015842	if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
sw4646A-ms98-a-0032	sw04646-A_015842-016306	stay where you are and then you only go there as a last resort	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw4646A-ms98-a-0033	sw04646-A_016306-016632	or people send you there as a last resort	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1

sw4646A-ms98-a-0041	sw04646-A_020039-020205	yeah i guess	0 0 1
sw4646A-ms98-a-0043	sw04646-A_020606-020902	right when you need it you need it i guess	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1

sw4646A-ms98-a-0053	sw04646-A_023067-023851	and you probably if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
sw4646A-ms98-a-0055	sw04646-A_025781-025941	yeah	1
sw4646A-ms98-a-0056	sw04646-A_025941-026778	well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1

sw4646A-ms98-a-0062	sw04646-A_028673-029499	i i've known quite a few people that have um gone to retirement communities i don't know if they have them back there but	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0

sw4646B-ms98-a-0002	sw04646-B_000535-001240	no but i my grandparents were looking into it before so i know what they've said	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0

sw4646B-ms98-a-0007	sw04646-B_005626-005777	right	1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0008	sw04646-B_005777-006783	if they're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you're gonna have you know to put in there too because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0009	sw04646-B_006783-007112	they wanted someplace they can go and have their meals and	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
sw4646B-ms98-a-0010	sw04646-B_007112-007659	a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0011	sw04646-B_007659-007838	have their own room	1 0 0 1

sw4646B-ms98-a-0015	sw04646-B_014179-015054	well a lot of that's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help they need health care so they're already ill before they go	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0017	sw04646-B_015159-015392	that's probably a large factor	1 0 0 0 1

sw4646B-ms98-a-0021	sw04646-B_016556-016782	right right	1 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0022	sw04646-B_016782-017143	that's my grandparents it was just so that	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0023	sw04646-B_017143-017744	the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
sw4646B-ms98-a-0024	sw04646-B_017744-018372	so that was their thinking somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0026	sw04646-B_018472-018992	and also so they could find someplace they enjoyed while they still had	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0027	sw04646-B_018992-019976	choices to make so they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time i guess that's a problem too for people wait lists	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
sw4646B-ms98-a-0028	sw04646-B_019976-020614	and all that um you can't always get in when you want to and of course you can't just sit around and wait	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0030	sw04646-B_020753-021317	yeah and the money is also another issue how you're gonna pay for it	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
sw4646B-ms98-a-0031	sw04646-B_021317-021728	at that stage of life you only have so much money left and	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
sw4646B-ms98-a-0032	sw04646-B_021728-022752	i guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put in their savings i mean it is kind of fair but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0033	sw04646-B_022752-022986	so that's another problem	0 1 0 1
sw4646B-ms98-a-0035	sw04646-B_023792-024015	right right	1 1
