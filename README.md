Other things to maybe change:
* Brackets around unpronounced parts of words -- conveys important info, but also could mess with vocab size a lot.
* 'laughter' tokens -- same problem

Things I did change:
* leading and trailing hyphen on tokens -- dropped
* mispronunciations -- replaced with target tokens

Things I'm not going to change:
* tokens with '_1' on them (notation for common variants like 'cause' for 'because')
