Other things to maybe change:
* Brackets around unpronounced parts of words -- conveys important info, but also could mess with vocab size a lot.
* 'laughter' tokens -- same problem
* tokens with '_1' on them (keep -- this is notation for common variants like 'cause' for 'because')
* trailing hyphen on tokens -- gonna drop these
