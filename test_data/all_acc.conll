much	0
When	0
we	0
moved	1
here	0
to	0
Monterrey	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
big	0
change	1
because	1
it's	0
such	0
a	0
small	1
community	0
we're	0
just	0
above	0
Carmel	1
and	1
um	0
there's	0
hardly	1
most	1
everybody	1
seems	0
pretty	0
well	0
employed	1
around	0
here	1
and	0
um	0
those	0
that	0
aren't	0
there's	0
Celinas	1
which	0
is	0
about	0
a	1
fifteen	1
minute	1
drive	1
which	0
is	0
mostly	1
migrant	1
workers	0
and	0
there's	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
crime	0
there	1
um	0
migrant	0
Hispanic	0
farm	0
workers	0
uh	0
people	0
that	0
are	0
down	0
and	0
out	0
and	0
uh	0
they	0
all	0
seem	0
to	0
congregate	0
in	0
Celinas	0
not	0
so	0
much	0
here	0
in	0
Monterrey	0
so	0
it's	0
it's	0
pretty	0
quiet	0
i've	0
bee[n]	0
you	0
know	0
we	0
walk	1
the	0
streets	1
at	0
night	1
and	0
uh	0
people	0
run	1
in	0
the	0
park	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
you're	0
just	0
have	1
your	0
normal	1
smarts	1
about	0
you	0
then	0
you	0
really	1
don't	0
have	0
to	0
worry	1
or	0

really	0
even	0
uh	0
even	0
in	0
the	0
worst	0
crime	0
areas	0
in	0
Burlington	0
i	0
i	1
can	0
walk	0
the	0
streets	1
i	0
wouldn't	0
i	1
if	0
i	0
did	1
it	0
every	0
night	1
i	0
think	1
there	0
would	0
be	0
trouble	1
in	0
our	0
house	0
so	0

uh-huh	0

so	0
you	0
wouldn't	0
get	0
confronted	1
or	0
anything	0

right	0

but	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
you	0
would	0
uh	0
someone	1
might	0
grab	1
you	0
mess	1
around	1
with	0
you	0
but	0
they're	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
grab	1
you	0
steal	1
you[r]	0
your	0
money	1
and	0
slit	1
your	0
throat	1
which	0
in	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
big	0
cities	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-mean]	0
that's	0
you	0
you're	0
gonna	0
have	0
to	0
expect	0
that	0
to	0
happen	0
people	1
are	0
just	0
totally	1
unfeeling	1

uh-huh	0
oh	0
well	0
i	1
didn't	0
know	1
that	0
about	0
Burlington	0
i'll	1
have	0
to	0
keep	1
that	0
in	0
mind	1

well	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
like	1
that	1
topic	1

uh	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
i've	1
got	1
mixed	1
feelings	1
about	1
the	1
topic	1

do	1
you	1
i	1
don't	1

no	1
okay	1

no	1
i'm	1
pretty	1
opinionated	1
about	1
that	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know	1
i	1
agree	1
with	1
it	1
i	1
think	1
uh	1
i	1
think	1
a	1
company	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
test	1
at	1
any	1
any	1
employee	1
anytime	1
they	1
see	1
fit	1

well	1

i	1
just	1
i	1
just	1
don't	0
think	1
there's	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
our	1
en[vironment]	1
environment	1
you	1
know	1
in	0
the	1
work	1
force	1
for	1
drugs	1
or	1
alcohol	1
either	1

well	1
i	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
drugs	0
or	1
alcohol	1
but	1
if	1
you'll	1
remember	0
when	1
the	1
teachers	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
TCAT	1
they	1
were	0
talking	1
about	1
drug	1
testing	1
us	1

right	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
we	1
were	1
laughing	1
that	1
we'd	1
have	0
to	1
go	0
to	1
that	0
examination	1
to	0
prove	1
we	0
could	0
read	0
and	1
write	1
with	0
a	0
specimen	1
of	0
urine	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
we	1
found	1
it	1
belittling	1

you	1
did	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	1
well	1
i	1
can	0
sort	1
of	0
understand	1
that	1
uh	1
but	0
not	1
being	1
a	1
teacher	0
as	0
you	1
are	0
you	1
know	1
i	0
i	1
was	0
not	0
quite	1
as	0
sympathetic	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
as	1
i	1
probably	0
would	1
have	1
been	0
if	1
if	1
Kay	1
were	1
a	1
teacher	1
or	0
something	1

that's	1
true	0

but	1
uh	0

but	1
then	0
you	1
know	1
at	0
the	1
same	1
token	1
i'm	1
not	1
against	1
because	0
i	1
look	1
at	1
airline	1
pilots	1
bus	1
drivers	0
you	1
know	1
people	1
that	1
really	1
have	1
other	1
peoples'	0
lives	1
in	0
their	1
hands	1
truck	1
drivers	1

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	0

that's	0
right	1

that's	1
right	1

it's	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	1
a	1
huge	1
problem	0
with	0
truck	1
drivers	0
using	1
drugs	0
and	1
alcohol	0

th[at's]	0
that's	0
right	1
and	0

and	0
i	1
think	0
it	0
is	1
a	0
big	0
problem	1
with	1
them	0
using	1
drugs	0
from	0
what	0
you	1
read	1
you	0
know	1

and	1

but	1
uh	1

you	1
know	0
in	0
those	1
areas	0
i	1
really	1
you	1
know	1
do	1
believe	1
that	1
maybe	1
we	1
should	1
clean	1
up	0
our	0
you	1
know	0
house	1

yeah	1
i	1
think	1
so	0
too	1
i	1

i	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
it	1
uh	0
i	1
know	1
Kay's	1
company	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
started	1
it	0
couple	0
of	1
years	1
ago	0
and	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
the	0
people	1
even	1
the	1
professional	1
people	1
were	0
boy	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
against	1
them	0
doing	1
that	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
i	1
thought	1
jeez	1
to	1
me	1
it's	0
quite	1
simple	1
uh	0
you	0
either	1
need	1
a	1
job	1
or	0
you	1
don't	1
the	1
the	0
job	1
is	1
what	1
provides	1
all	1
of	1
your	1
needs	1
and	1
uh	1
if	0
they	1
say	0
hey	1
you	0
can't	0
do	1
this	1
work	1
i'd	0
say	1
hey	1
i	0
agree	1
i	1
don't	0
i	0
won't	1
do	1
that	0
and	0
i	1
think	0
most	1
of	1
them_1	1
have	0
agreed	1
to	1
that	0
now	1
although	0
they	0
didn't	0
like	1
it	0
at	0
first	0

yeah	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
just	1
like	0
anything	1
else	1
a	0
new	1
concept	1
you	1
know	0
as	1
i	1
had	1
said	1
if	0
i	1
have	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
testing	1
area	0
with	0
my	0
urine	1
specimen	0
i	0
was	0
insulted	1

yeah	0
i[t]	0
it	1
it	1
is	0
i	1
can	1
see	1
where	1
you	1
would	1
think	0
yeah	1
that	1
is	1
belittling	1
you	1
know	1
i'd	1
probably	1
feel	1
the	1
same	0
way	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
do	0
that	1

but	0
at	0
the	0
same	1
token	1
in	0
education	1
we	0
can't	0
do	0
d[rug]	0
drug	1
random	1
drug	0
testing	1
on	0
kids	1

yeah	1
that's	0
true	1

you	1
know	1
i	1
mean	1
their	1
rights	0
are	1
protected	1

you	1
bet	1
oh	1
gosh	1
they	1
w[ould]	1
they	0
would	0
really	1
raise	1
a	1
stink	1
if	1
that	1
was	0
to	0
happen	1

what	1

well	1
but	0
why	1
if	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
do	0
teachers	1
or	0
professionals	1
why	1
not	0
do	1
the	0
kids	1
when	0
we	0
see	1
them	0
and	0
they're	0
you	1
know	0
under	1
the	0
influence	1

right	1
yes	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
that	0
i	0
i	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
be	0
opposed	0
to	0
it	0
at	0
all	1
it's	0
just	1
our	0
bleeding	1
heart	0
liberals	1
that	1
would	0
fight	1
it	0
too[th]	0
tooth	0
and	0
nail	1
you	0
know	1

that's	1
true	1

but	0
uh	1
well	1
Lynn	1
i've	1
enjoyed	0
talking	1
with	1
you	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
how	0
long	1
we're	0
suppos[ed]	0
to	0
carry	0
on	0
a	0
conversation	1
do	0
you	1

it's	0
three	1
minutes	1
and	0
the	0
clicker	1
comes	0
in	0
when	1
it's	0
time	1
to	0

oh	0
well	0
we'd	1
better	0
keep	0
talking	1
because_1	0
i've	1
not	0
heard	1
it	0
have	1
we	0

yeah	1

have	0
you	1
heard	0
it	0

no	1

anyway	1
we	0
both	1
a	0
sort	1
of	0
agree	1
on	1
it	0
don't	1
we	0
a[bout]	0
about	0
random	1
testing	1

well	1
do	0
we	0
agree	1
or	1
unless	1
it's	1
it's	0
not	1
me	1

well	0
you	0
see	1

you	1
know	0
here	0
we	1
go	1
again	0
i	1
mean	1

yeah	0
yeah	0

yeah	1
you	1
know	0
i	0

if	0
you	0
agree	1
yeah	1

i	0
believe	1
that	0
truck	1
drivers	0
and	0
people	1
that	0
have	0
even	0
though	1
teachers	1
have	1
other	0
kids	0
lives	0
in	0
their	1
hands	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
stoned	1
or	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
drunk	1

yeah	1

and	1
there	1
was	1
an	0
incident	1
in	0
my	1
children's	1
high	1
school	0
where	1
a	1
teacher	1
stayed	1
drunk	0

is	1
that	1
right	1

uh-huh	0

you	0
just	1
don't	0
think	1
of	0
that	0
happening	1
with	0
teachers	1

and	1
yet	1

i	0
really	1
don't	1
i	0
when	0
i	1
think	0
of	0
drug	1
testing	0
i'm	1
thinking	0
of	0
the	0
uh	0
you	0
kn[ow]	0
outside	1
of	0
education	0

uh	1
well	1
no	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
we	0
are	1
as	1
susceptible	1
a	1
society	1
as	0
anybody	0
else	1

sure	1
sure	1

i	0
know	1
that	0
but	0
uh	0
you	0
don't	0
think	1
of	0
that	0
first	0
hand	1
normally	1

and	1
uh	1

yeah	1
well	1
did	0
you	1
hear	1
on	0
the	0
news	1
where	1
the	1
teacher	1
of	0
the	0
year	1
was	0
up	1
for	0
child	1
molestation	1

isn't	1
that	0
isn't	1
that	0
mind	1
boggling	1

it	0
was	0
on	0
the	0
news	1
tonight	1

goodness	1
it	0
it	0
is	1
it's	0
mind	1
bogg[ling]	0
and	0
well	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
agree	0
with	0
you	0
i	1
know	0
teachers	1
are	0
just	0
like	0
everybody	0
else	1
same	1
problems	1
the	0
same	0
uh	0
good	0
qualities	1
as	0
anybody	0
else	1

yeah	1

then	1
i	1
think	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
it	0
came	1
push	1
came	0
to	0
shove	0
i'd	0
probably	1
be	0
drug	1
tested	1
you	1
know	0
because_1	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

because_1	0
it	0
does	1
you	1
know	0

y[ou]	0
you	0
think	1
the	0
benefit	1
would	0
be	0
greater	1
than	0
the	0

yeah	1
because_1	1
you	1
know	1
as	1
i	0
say	1
i'm	0
sitting	1
there	0
fussing	0
and	0
fussing	1
and	1
yet	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
you	1
know	0
one	1
teacher	0
who	0
was	1
an	1
alcoholic	1
in	1
school	1
as	0
well	0
as	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
presume	1
out	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
that	1
was	0
in	0
your	1
children's	0
high	1
school	0

um-hum	0

isn't	0
that	0
amazing	1

and	0
you	1
know	0
my	1
children	1
brought	0
it	0
to	0
my	1
attention	0
i	0
never	0
was	0
there	1
to	0
see	1
it	0

if	0
it	1
if	0
it's	0
if	1
it	0
was	0
true	1
there	1
i'm	0
sure	1
it's	1
true	0
with	0
just	0
about	0
probably	1
to	0
some	1
degree	0
every	0
school	1
there	0
is	1

um-hum	1

you	1
know	0
because	0
they	0
represent	1
a	0
pretty	1
good	0

and	0
that's	1
not	0
giving	0
a	0
good	0
example	1
to	0
students	1

no	1
certainly	0
not	1
uh	0
certainly	0
not	1
they	0
don't	0
need	1
that	0
example	0
but	0

okay	1
well	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
start	1
because_1	1
it	1
said	1
i	1
was	1
suppose	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
do	1
you	1

do	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
elderly	1
relatives	1
currently	1
in	1
uh	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
now	1

yes	1
i	1
do	1

do	1
you	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
grandmother	1
she's	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
two	1

oh	1
my	1
gosh	1

she'll	1
be	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
three	1
in	1
August	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
we	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
she	1
lives	1
with	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
who	1
also	1
live	1
here	1
in	1
town	1
and	1
then	1
my	1
sister	1
takes	1
care	1
of	1
her	1

uh-huh	1

she	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
two	1
she	1
still	1
has	1
all	1
of	1
her	0
faculties	1

right	1

she	1
still	1
has	1
her	1
snap	1
she	1
takes	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
business	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
that	1
she	1
has	0
gotten	0
weak	1
and	0
actually	1
has	0
to	0
have	1
a	0
little	0
walker	1
but	1
with	1
somebody	1
that	0
needs	1
around	1
the	1
clock	0
care	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
family	1
age	1

right	1

i've	1
seen	1
them	1
in	0
the	1
she's	0
been	0
there	1
ten	1
years	1
now	0
and	1
i	1
have	1
seen	0
them	0
age	1
twenty	1
in	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
and	0
with	0
the	0
expense	1
and	0
everything	1

yeah	1

i	0
th[ink]	0
i	0
still	1
think	0
it	0
is	0
worth	1
it	0
if	0
you	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
a	0
good	1
nursing	1
home	1
and	1
they	1
needed	1
some	1
quality	1
care	1
i	1
would	1
put	1
someone	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	1

right	1

my	0
mother-in-law	1
finally	1
they	1
had	1
to	0
make	0
a	0
family	1
decision	1
there's	0
seven	1
children	1
in	0
my	0
husband's	0
family	1
and	1
fortunately	1
four	1
of	1
them_1	0
live	0
in	0
the	1
same	1
home	1
town	1
and	1
she	0
has	1
Alzheimer's	1
it	0
was	0
getting	1
where	0
she	1
was	0
getting	1
th[ings]	0
dangerous	1
i	0
mean	1
letting	0
strangers	1
in	1
and	0
things	1
like	1
this	1
but	1

um-hum	0

but	1
they	1
were	0
very	0
fortunate	1
it's	1
a	1
small	1
town	1
and	1
she	0
happens	1
to	0
room	1
with	1
one	1
of	0
the	1
doctor's	1
mother's	1
and	0
then	1
she's	0
got	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
family	1
there	1
and	1
that	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
all	1
of	0
the	1
time	1
but	0

oh	1
well	1
that's	1
good	1

but	0
she	1
really	1
doesn't	1
nobody	1
thought	0
she	0
would	1
adjust	1
but	0
she's	1
adjusted	1
beautifully	1

oh	0
that	1
is	0
great	1

but	0
then	1
i	0
am	1
also	1
facing	1
my	1
father	1
who	0
is	0
very	1
sick	1
and	0
my	1
mother	1
and	0
father	1
reside	0
in	0
Colorado	1
she's	1
been	0
taking	1
care	1
of	0
him	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
how	0
much	1
longer	1
this	1
can	1
last	1
and	1
at	0
that	0
point	1
because_1	1
he	1
requires	0
round	1
the	1
clock	0
he	1
can't	1
do	0
anything	0
without	1
her	0
he	1
doesn't	0
know	1
when	1
to	0
take	0
his	0
medicine	1
and	0
it's	0
really	1
sad	1
and	0
i	0
have	1
thought	1
if	0
something	1
would	0
happen	0
to	0
my	0
mother	1
for	1
uh	0
my	0
brother's	1
are	0
not	1
interested	0
in	0
helping	1
me	0
so	1
i	1
would	1
have	0
to	1
move	1
him	1
down	1
here	1
that	1
way	1
i	1
want	0
to	1
see	1
the	0
nursing	1
home	0
if	0
i	1
have	1
to	0
put	0
him	0
into	1
one	0
you	1
know	1
where	0
i	1
can	0
go	1
see	1
it	0
i	0
i'd	0
be	0
very	1
uncomfortable	1
with	0
him	0
being	1
in	0
Colorado	1
and	1

why	1
yeah	1
i'm	1
sure	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
really	1
good	1
nursing	1
homes	1
around	1
Dallas	1

yes	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them_1	1
are	1
limited	1
care	1
too	0
where	1
people	1
can	0
do	1
uh	1
like	1
they	1
have	0
apartment	1
styles	1
but	1
that	1
wouldn't	1
work	1
for	0
him	1
i	0
think	1
he's	1
beyond	1
that	1
where	1
if	0
you	0
need	1
help	1
you	0
can	0
get	1
it	0
but	1
basically	1
people	1
kind	0
of	0
have	1
a	0
small	1
apartment	1
and	0
doctor's	1
are	0
available	1
if	0
they	0
need	1
them	0

um-hum	1
i	1
i	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lady	1
that	0
lives	1
in	0
a	1
place	1
similar	1
to	0
that	1
in	1
Austin	1

and	0
allows	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
well	0
the	0
only	0
problem	1
with	0
these	0
are	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
very	1
expensive	1
of	1
course	0
i	0
guess	1
all	1
nursing	0
homes	1
there	0
is	1
but	1

and	0
the	0
bad	1
thing	0
about	1
it	0
before	1
you	0
can	1
get	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
government	1
help	1
you	1
just	0
practically	1
have	0
we	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
pauper	1

right	1

it	0
it	1
takes	0
every	1
penny	1
they	0
want	1
you	0
to	0
spend	1
every	0
dime	1
you	0
have	1
before	1
the	0
government	1
will	0
pay	1
for	1
your	0
your	1
care	1

yeah	1

right	1

and	0
that's	1
the	0
sad	1
part	0
about	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	1
s[ee]	0
uh	1
yeah	1
and	0
i	1
think	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
people	0
who	1
do	0
it	0
now	1
in	0
Colorado	1
it's	0
interesting	1
i	0
talked	0
to	0
my	0
mother	1
they	0
allow	1
you	0
sixty	1
five	0
thousand	1
dollars	1
and	0
your	0
car	1
and	0
your	0
home	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
could	0
make	1
it	1
on	0
that	1
what	0
she	1
probably	1
would	0
do	1
is	1
disburse	1
the	0
money	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
i	0
would	0
send	0
it	1
back	1
to	0
her	1
so	0
that's	0
[laughter-probably]	1
what	0
would	1
happen	1

um-hum	0
i	1
think	0
that's	0
what	0
most	0
people	0
do	1
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
give	1
it	0
everything	1
away	1

yeah	1
it's	1
unfortunate	1

i	0
i	0
i	1
work	0
at	0
a	0
brokerage	1
firm	1
and	0
i	1
have	0
seen	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
that	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
gift	1
you	0
know	1
their	0
belongings	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
they	1
can	1
each	0
year	1
in	0
anticipation	1
of	0
having	0
to	0
move	0
to	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0

right	1

yeah	1
it's	0
frightening	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
uh	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
how	1
old	1
you	0
are	0
i'm	1
forty	0
six	1
you	0
know	1
we're	1
the	1
generation	1
moving	0
into	1
this	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
our	0
kids	1
are	0
gonna	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
us	0
you	0
know	1

i	1
can't	0
imagine	1
i'm	1

i'm	1
twenty	0
nine	1

yeah	1

and	1
everybody	1
in	1
my	1
family's	1
always	1
had	0
we	0
don't	0
have	1
any	0
children	1
everybody	0
that	0
has	1
has	1
them_1	0
later	1
in	0
life	1
so	1

yeah	1

so	1
my	0
my	0
mother	1
and	0
my	0
father	1
are	0
in	0
their	0
late	0
sixties	1
so	1
i	0
mean	1
they're	1
not	0
that	1
far	1
away	1

right	1

i	0
also	1
fill	1
in	1
my	1
generation	1
a	0
squeeze	1
between	0
looking	1
to	0
having	1
to	0
help	1
my	0
parents	1
and	0
still	1
having	0
to	0
help	0
my	0
son	1
because	0
things	1
are	1
so	0
rough	1
out	1
there	1
job	1
wise	1
and	0
he's	0
still	1
living	0
at	0
home	1
and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	0
he's	0
ever	0
going	0
to	0
[laughter-get]	1
on	0
his	0
own	1
the	0
way	0
things	0
are	1

oh	1
i	0
know	1

and	0
so	0
it's	1
kind	1
of	0
sq[ueezed]	0
you	0
feel	0
squeezed	1
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
having	0
both	1
generations	1
but	0
it	0
something	1
will	0
have	0
to	0
change	1
as	0
more	1
and	0
more	1
of	1
us	1
get	1
older	1
uh	0
luckily	1
if	1
we	0
could	1
be	0
like	1
your	0
grandmother	1
i	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
would	0
love	1
to	0
live	1
to	1
a	0
hundred	1
and	1
two	1
if	0
i	1
were	0
okay	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
these	1
people	1
in	1
their	0
seventies	1
yeah	1

it	0
but	0
yeah	1
most	0

most	0
people	0
aren't	1

yeah	1
most	1
aren't	1
that's	0
the	0
problem	1

and	0
that's	0
the	0
bad	0
thing	1
i	0
would	0
hate	1
to	0
have	0
lived	1
so	0
long	1
she	1
lived	0
by	0
herself	1
my	0
grandfather	1
passed	0
away	0
before	0
i	1
was	0
born	1
so	0
she	1
lived	0
by	1
herself	1
up	0
until	0
she	0
was	0
ninety	1
ninety	0
one	1
and	0
just	0
did	0
everything	1
and	1

that's	1
incredible	1

well	1
anyway	1
i	1
uh	1
i	1
uh	1
oh	1
i	1
i	1
did	1
forget	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
name	1
by	1
the	1
way	1

um	1
i'm	1
Ann	1

oh	1
you're	1
Ann	1
hi	1
but	1
um	1
anyway	1
i	1
uh	1
lot	1
of	1
lot	1
of	1
s[tuff]	1
interesting	1
procedural	1
things	1
i	1
think	1
we	1
could	1
we	1
could	1
change	1
if	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
talking	1
about	0
the	1
subject	1
to[night]	0
tonight	1
which	1
is	1
some	1
i	1
guess	1
criminal	1
courts	1
the	1

criminal	1
courts	1
yes	1

yeah	1
the	1
the	0
one	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
uh	1
something	1
something	1
that's	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Rodney	1
King	1
trial	1
here	1
in	0
town	1
and	0
that	1
is	1
uh	0
and	0
that	1
is	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
jurors	1
because	1
of	1
or	0
in	1
spite	1
of	0
their	1
race	1
uh	1
ye[ah]	1

oh	1
really	1

yeah	1
well	1
the	1
the	1
uh	1
the	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
the	0
the	0
the	1
uh	1
the	1
jury	1
that's	1
trying	1
uh	0
the	0
officers	1
in	0
that	1
case	1
is	1
is	1
an	0
all	1
white	1
panel	1

right	1

and	1
there's	1
been	0
a	0
lot	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
local	1
papers	1
of	0
that	0
fact	1

how	0
is	1
it	0

i	0
can't	1
i'm	1
a	0
little	1
surprised	1
they	0
didn't	0
get	1
a	0
change	1
of	0
venue	1
on	0
that	1
one	1

they	1
have	1
they	0
have	1
they	1
moved	1
it	0
up	1
to	1
the	1
county	1
north	1
of	0
here	1

oh	1

um	1
it's	0
in	1
Ventura	1
and	1
there's	0
there's	0
still	1
quite	1
a	0
bit	1
of	0
publicity	1
obviously	1
and	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
debatable	1
whether	1
you	0
could	0
get	0
a	0
fair	1
trial	1
almost	0
anywhere	1
because	0
that	1
uh	0
that	1

well	0
that	0
videotape	1
was	1
just	1
horrible	1

yeah	1
it	1
was	1
everywhere	1

yeah	1

so	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
i	1
i	1
think	0
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
someone	0
uh	1
find	1
a	1
panel	1
that	0
would	1
be	0
not	1
have	1
seen	1
it	0
and	0
and	0
known	1
of	0
what	1
was	0
going	0
on	0

oh	0
i	1
agree	1
with	0
you	1
but	0
i	0
can't	1
imagine	1
that	0
they	0
would	0
do	1
an	0
all	1
white	1
jury	1
without	1
having	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
of	1
discrimination	1
or	1
or	1
you	0
know	1
uh	0
appeal	1
on	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
jury	1
of	1
his	0
peers	1
and	0
all	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
stuff	1

exactly	1
you	1
know	1
um	0
the	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i'm	1
kind	0
of	0
torn	1
on	0
this	0
issue	1
it's	0
like	1
they're	0
saying	1
well	1
on	1
the	0
one	1
hand	0
they're	0
not	1
he's	1
not	0
getting	0
a	0
jury	1
of	0
his	0
peers	1
which	1
is	1
in	0
some	1
ways	1
i	1
think	1
true	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
is	1
it's	1
also	1
saying	0
that	1
white	1
jurors	1
are	1
not	1
going	0
to	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
convict	1

right	1

uh	1
you	1
know	0
they're	1
not	1
going	1
to	0
do	0
their	1
job	1
which	1
is	0
the	0
whole	1
the	1
whole	1
point	0
of	1
being	0
on	1
a	1
jury	0
is	1
to	0
convict	1
or	1
or	1
or	0
uh	1
let	1
go	0
based	1
on	1
whether	0
or	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
whether	1
or	0
not	1
the	0
evidence	1
says	1
that	0
there's	0
enough	0

exactly	1

based	1
on	0
fact	1
right	1

how	1
interesting	1
ooh	1
so	1
what's	1
the	0
prevailing	1
thought	1
within	1
the	0
community	1

um	1

i	1
mean	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
the	1
news	1
media's	0
gonna	1
make	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
what	1
about	1
the	1
community	1

they	1
well	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
depends	1
on	0
who	1
you	0
talk	0
to	0
i	1
haven't	0
talked	1
to	0
uh	0
i	0
haven't	1
talked	1
to	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	1
of	0
black	1
people	0
on	0
it	0
but	0
i	0
i	0
rather	1
imagine	1
there's	1
there's	1
some	1
snickering	1
about	1
it	0
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
usually	1
fatalistic	1
oh	0
here	1
we	0
go	0
again	1
folks	1
kind	0
of	1
stuff	1

uh-huh	1

oh	0
my	1
goodness	1
that	1
can't	1
be	0
good	1
for	0
Los	1
Angeles	1
either	1

no	1
no	1
i	1
you	1
know	0
on	1
on	0
on	0
one	1
hand	0
y[ou]	0
on	1
the	0
one	1
hand	1
you	0
almost	1
hope	1
that	1
they	1
convict	1
them	0
because	1
it's	0
th[ey]	1
they	0
have	1
that	1
very	1
strong	1
piece	1
of	0
physical	1
evidence	1
showing	1
these	1
people	0
beating	1
the	1
heck	1
out	0
of	1
this	1
guy	1
um	0

oh	0
exactly	1

unfortunately	1
that	1
kind	1
of	0
thing	0
is	0
not	1
limited	1
to	1
uh	0
a	0
big	0
city	1
like	0
Los	0
Angeles	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
just	0
about	1
anywhere	1

um-hum	0

there	1

well	0

but	1
that's	0
that's	0
interesting	1

yeah	0
um	0

what	1
about	1
the	1
judge	1
who's	0
hearing	1
the	1
case	1
is	0
he	1
gonna	1
be	0
impartial	1
is	0
he	1
going	0
to	1
be	0
a	0
g[ood]	0
a	0
good	1
adjudicator	1

i	1
don't	0
know	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
and	0
again	1
there's	0
something	1
else	1
th[at]	0
you	0
know	0
there	1
was	0
a	0
uh	0
i[t]	0
something	1
else	1
along	0
those	0
lines	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
girl	1
out	1
here	1
named	1
Latausha	1
Harlins	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
this	1
this	0
got	1
this	1
got	0
as	0
much	0
notoriety	1
but	0
it's	0
rather	1
almost	1
as	0
infamous	1
here	1
as	0
it	0
was	1
as	0
it	0
was	1
with	0
uh	0
the	0
Rodney	1

kind	0
of	1
a	0

popped	1
her	0

of	0
course	1
the	1
you	0

up	1
and	0
and	0
the	0
judge	1
gave	0

i	0
like	1
watching	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
thing	0
it's	0

do	0
you	1
like	0
um	0
like	1
someone	1
recent	1
like	0
Enya	1
have	0
you	0
ever	1
heard	0
of	0
her	1
she's	0
not	0
rock	1
but	1
sh[e]	0
she's	1
from	0
Ireland	1

no	1
i	0
haven't	1
heard	1
her	0

oh	1
okay	1

and	1
uh	0
she's	1
gotten	1
some	0
uh	1
she's	1
been	0
on	0
like	0
the	0
top	1
ten	1
i	0
guess	1
or	0
whatever	1

oh	0
really	1

she	1
she	1
did	0
the	0
Orinoco	1

uh	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
uh	1
to	1
jury	1
trials	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
i	1
really	1
feel	1
as	1
though	1
uh	1
jury	1
trials	1
are	1
are	1
uh	1
whatever	1
system	1
has	1
been	1
been	1
used	1
historically	1
in	1
particular	1
jurisdiction	1
you	1
know	1
is	1
really	1
the	1
the	1
only	1
kinds	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
use	1
because	1
the	0
the	0
jurisprudence	1
is	1
you	0
know	1
based	1
on	0
on	1
uh	0
you	1
know	1
on	1
accumulated	1
body	1
of	1
law	1
and	1
if	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
situation	1
where	1
you	0
change	1
that	1
body	1
of	0
law	1
then	1
all	0
of	1
sudden	1
they	0
they	1
start	1
they	1
could	0
start	1
going	1
back	1
and	0
digging	0
up	0
all	0
these	0
cases	1
that	0
uh	1
that	0
would	1
be	1
handled	1
differently	1
were	1
they	0
judged	1
by	1
today's	1
standards	1
so	0

um	0

so	0
i	0
i	0
really	1
don't	0
think	1
it	0
th[ey]	0
they	1
can	0
really	1
do	1
much	0
of	1
anything	0
to	1
change	1
it	1
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	1

i	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
so	1
possibly	1
in	1
the	1
jury	1
selection	1
would	1
be	0
the	1
only	1

just	1
for	1
example	1
what	1
we're	1
seeing	1
in	1
California	1
i	1
guess	1
yeah	1
it	1
makes	1
you	1
wonder	1
um	1
had	1
the	0
jury	1
been	0
a	1
different	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
what	1
would've	1
happened	1
with	1
that	1
outcome	1
um	1
and	0
and	1
the	0
problems	1
that	1
that	0
has	0
come	1
that	0
has	0
come	1
from	1
this	1
decision	1
that	0
that	1
jury	0
came	1
to	1
after	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
witnessed	1
what	1
we	1
did	1
with	1
the	1
video	1
tape	0
beating	1
um	1
just	1
makes	0
you	0
wonder	1
i	1
guess	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
they	1

well	1
won't	1
well	0
maybe	1
they	0
used	1
a	0
little	1
bit	0
too	0
much	1
force	1
with	0
stuff	1
like	0
that	1
but	0
then	1
then	1
you	0
know	1
the	0
defense	1
lawyer	0
addressed	1
each	1
and	1
every	0
one	1
of	1
those	0
blows	1
apparently	1

um-hum	0

and	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
other	1
two	0
guys	1
sat	1
in	0
the	0
car	1

that's	1
that	1
um-hum	0

um-hum	0

and	1
they	1
didn't	0
get	1
beat	1
up	1
you	0
know	1
Rodney	1

no	1
um-hum	0

Rodney	1
got	0
beat	1
up	0
because	1
he	0
he	0
you	0
know	1
he	0
pur[poses]	0
you	1
know	0
he	0
involved	1
himself	1
in	1
some	0
sub	1
self-destructive	1
behavior	1

um-hum	0

and	0
uh	0
um	1
just	1
like	0
the	0
burning	1
and	0
looting	1
is	0
self-destruct	0
everybody	1

uh-huh	1

everybody	1
says	0
well	0
this	1
is	0
the	0

they're	0
a	0
bunch	1
of	0
animals	1

with	0
an	0
environment	1
where	0
you're	0
gonna	0

dead	1
as	0
a	1
result	0
of	0
that	0

i	0
know	1

that's	1
really	0
ridiculous	1

and	0
i'm	1
just	0
trying	1
to	0
determine	1
you	1
know	0
how	1
you	1
address	0
and	1
how	0
you	0
weigh	1
you	1
know	0
Rodney	1
getting	1
getting	1
the	0
the	0
hell	1
beat	0
out	1
of	1
him	0
against	0
you	1
know	0
forty	1
deaths	0

against	1
forty	1
other	0
people	1
being	0

yeah	1
and	0
there's	0
no	1
other	1
i	0
i'm	0
not	1
su[re]	0
exactly	1
sure	1
uh	0
what	1
the	0
circumstances	1
surrounding	1
the	0
deaths	1
and	0
i'm	0
very	1
upset	0
that	0
the	0
news	1
media	0
has	0
not	0
identified	1
those	0
deaths	1
and	0
and	0
pursued	1
it	0
you	1
know	0
because	0
i'm	0
interested	1
in	0
the	0
circumstances	1
surrounding	1
this	0
thing	0

those	0
deaths	1

um-hum	1

is	0
it	0
a	0
looter	1
that	0
got	0
shot	1
by	0
a	0
store	1
owner	0
i	0
you	1
know	0
no	0
tears	1

or	0
just	0
a	0
by[stander]	1
an	0
innocent	0
bystander	1
or	0
somebody	0
got	0
actually	0
beat	0
to	0
death	1
or	0
what	1

yeah	1
and	0
and	1
so	1
i	0
but	0
i	0
i	0
suspect	1
a	0
number	1
of	0
them_1	0

um	0

you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
see	0
film	1
of	0
people	1
being	0
pulled	1
out	0
of	0
a	0
car	1
and	0
shot	1
you	0
know	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
street	1

it	0
uh	0
or	0
or	0
beaten	1

and	0
and	0
my	1
reaction	0
is	0
i	1
would've	0
run	0
over	0
fifty	0
people	1
before	0
rather	1
than	0
stop	1
and	0
uh	0
and	0
th[ere]	0
there	1
would've	0
been	0
just	0
uh	0
nothing	0
but	0
carnage	1
after	0
after	0
if	0
i'd	1
been	0
at	0
the	0
wheel	0

right	1

no	1
one	0
would've	0
stopped	1
me	0

right	1

that's	1
that's	1
exactly	0
how	0
i	1
feel	0
too	1
i	1
wouldn't	1
have	0
uh	1
they	0
wouldn't	1
have	0
stopped	0
my	0
car	1
for	0
any	0
anything	1
had	0
i	1
seen	0
them	0
coming	1
but	0
i	1
was	0
just	1
wondering	1
since	0
you	1
were	1
you're	1
in	0
you're	0
back	1
east	1
um	1
and	0
a	0
little	1
closer	0
to	0
the	0
the	0
bigger	1
cities	0
probably	1
than	0
we	1
are	1
in	0
Idaho	1
here	1

right	1
i'm	0
inside	1
the	0
beltway	1

oh	0

you	0
know	0
how	0
capital	1
gang	1
they	0
always	0
say	1
well	1
inside	1
the	0
beltway	1
they	0
think	0
thus	1
and	0
so	1
and	0
i	0
say	0
well	0
wait	1
a	0
minute	0
i'm	1
inside	0
the	0
beltway	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
like	0
that	1

um-hum	0

i'm	0
a	0
government	1
employee	1

oh	0
in	0
what	1
uh	0
section	1
of	1
the	0
government	1
do	0
you	0
work	1

i'm	1
with	0
the	0
FBI	1

[laughter-oh]	0
oh	0
that's	0
[laughter-interesting]	1

yes	1
an[d]	0
and	0
so	0
um	0
uh	1
and	0
and	1
the	1
reason	1
i'm	1
doing	1
this	0
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
know	1
Rick	1
who	1
is	0
another	1
government	1
employee	1
wanted	1
a	1
spee[ch]	0
segments	1
of	0
my	0
speech	1
that	0
uh	1
were	0
done	1
a	0
year	1
ago	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
he	0
wanted	1
another	1
collection	0
a	0
year	0
later	1

oh	0

and	0
so	1
this	0
is	0
my	0
seventh	1
call	1
a	0
year	1
ago	0
i	0
did	0
eleven	1
calls	0

oh	1
i	0
see	1

and	0
so	1
that's	1
that's	1
why	0
uh	0
uh	0
tha[t's]	0
that's	1
why	0
i'm	0
religiously	1
getting	0
on	0
the	0
phone	1
because	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
unique	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
unique	1
situation	1
here	0
in	1
that	1
if	0
i	0
don't	1
participate	0

do	1
you	1
have	1
any	1

sure	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
Springer	1
Spaniel	1
and	1
her	1
name	1
is	1
Thumper	1
she's	1
about	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1

old	1
i	1
got	1
her	1
for	1
Christmas	1
from	1
my	1
family	1

uh	1
back	1
when	1
we	1
lived	1
in	1
Nebraska	1
i	1
like	1
to	1
hunt	1
and	1
uh	1
so	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
hunting	1
dog	1
like	1
Thumper	1
that	1
boy	1
i	1
could	1
just	0
go	1
out	1
and	1
get	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
game	1

did	1
it	1
work	1

yeah	1
except	1
we	1
live	0
in	0
Plano	1
Texas	1

for	1
many	1

a	1
dog	1
that	1
was	1
part	1
Springer	1
Spaniel	1
i	1
just	1
love	1

her	1
name	1
was	0
Molly	1
but	1
she	1
isn't	1
alive	1
anymore	1
we	1
had	1
her	1
for	1
hm	1
fifteen	1
years	1
i	1
think	1
my	1
family	1
did	1
and	1
just	1
loved	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
greatest	1
greatest	0
um	1
went	1
through	1
two	1
generations	1
of	1
children	1
in	1
my	1
family	1
and	1
was	1
always	1
very	1
gentle	1

do	0
you	1
have	1
a	0
pet	1
now	1

yeah	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
cat	1
now	1

also	1
and	1
he's	1
i	0
um	1
got	1
him	1
in	1
Arizona	1
and	0
when	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
live	1
there	1
and	1

eighteen	1
pounds	1

what	1
kind	1
of	1
cat	0
is	1
it	0

just	1
um	1
i	0
got	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
um	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
like	1
in	1
a	1
in	1
a	1
shed	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
building	1
when	0
i	1
got	1
him	1
so	1

uh-huh	1

so	1
he	1
and	0
he's	1
he	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
part	1
cross	1
part	1
with	0
some	1
kind	1
of	1
desert	1
animal	1
because_1	0
he's	1
very	0
long	1
and	1
lanky	1
but	0
he's	0
a	0
very	1
tame	1
spoiled	1
house	1
cat	0
you	1
know	1
now	1
that	1
i've	1
had	1
him	1
for	1
seven	1
years	1

being	0
born	1
outside	1
you	0
didn't	0
have	0
any	0
problems	1
house	1
training	1
them	0

no	1

uh	0
he's	0
uh	1
he's	1
really	0
spoiled	1
though	1
so	1
but	0
he's	1
really	1
big	1
so	1
lots	1
of	0
times	0
he	0
it	0
he	0
he	1
seems	0
to	0
get	0
in	0
fights	1
and	1
when	0
he	0
was	0
younger	1
i	1
think	0
he	0
started	1
them	1
and	0
now	1
i	1
think	1
he	0
barely	1
makes	1
it	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
gets	0
beat	1
up	0
even	0
though	0
he's	0
big	1
because_1	0
he's	0
pretty	1

a	1
few	0
scratches	1
now	1
and	0
then	1

sure	1

and	0
older	1

yeah	1

well	0
we	1
went	1
to	0
a	1
uh	0
cat	1
show	1
at	1
the	0
Plano	1
Center	1
here	0
in	0
town	1
and	0
uh	1
we	1
thought	1
that	1
we	1
have	0
a	1
cat	0
now	1
but	1
we	1
thought	0
well	1
if	0
we	1
ever	1
get	1
another	1
cat	1
you	1
know	1
we'd	1
want	1
something	1
kind	1
of	1
unique	1
so	1
we	1
kind	1
of	1
looked	1
around	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
everything	1
from	1
hairless	1
cats	1
to	1
Siamese	1
cats	1
and	1
Persian	1
cats	1
and	1
we	1
sort	1
of	1
fell	1
in	0
love	1
with	1
the	1
uh	1
Maine	1
Coon	1
cats	1

oh	1
i've	0
seen	1
them	0
i	0

they're	1
huge	1

yeah	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
they	1
um	1
weren't	1
they	1
they	1
were	1
actually	1
i	0
can't	1
remember	1
they	1
were	1
used	1
to	1
be	0
used	1
on	1
ships	1
and	1
in	0
for	0
for	0
mousers	1
you	0
know	1
so	0

oh	1

so	0
they're	0
very	0
nautical	1
too	1

i'll	0
be	1
darned	1
i	0
didn't	1
know	0
that	1

yeah	1
i	0
just	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
i'm	0
i	0
think	1
i'm	0
being	0
accurate	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
area	1
of	0
folklore	1
but	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	1

we[ll]	1
that's	1
interesting	1

yeah	1

we	1
kind	1
of	0
like	0
well	1
my	1
family	1
didn't	1
necessarily	0
like	0
like	1
them	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
i	1
did	0
but	0
the	0
Manx	1
is	1
that	1
the	0
one	0
that	0
doesn't	1
have	0
a	0
tail	1
it	0

yeah	1

it	0
sort	0
of	0
has	0
a	1
bob	1
tail	0
i	1
kind	0
of	1
like	1
that	0
too	1
but	1

yeah	1
i'd	0
love	1
to	0
go	0
to	1
a	1
cat	0
show	1
i'm	1
real	1
li[ke]	0
a	0
real	1
cat	0
lover	1
i'd	0
i'd	0
have	1
a	0
lot	1
more	0
cats	1
if	0
my	0
boyfriend	1
would	0
let	1
u[s]	1
let	1
me	0

he	1
doesn't	1
really	1
like	1
mine	1
let	1
alone	0
another	1
one	0

well	1
i'll	0
tell	1
you	0
an	0
interesting	0
story	1
about	0
how	1
i	0
got	1
my	1
dog	1
and	1
then	1
i	0
suppose	1
our	0
five	1
minutes	0
will	0
be	0
up	0
huh	1

yeah	1
okay	1

i	0
uh	0
work	1
for	0
a	1
university	1
and	0
i	1
went	1
to	0
uh	1
Omaha	1
Nebraska	1
to	1
recruit	1
students	1
and	0
i	1
had	1
some	1
time	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
a	0
a	0
pet	1
shop	1
and	0
i	1
saw	1
these	0
little	1
Springer	0
Spaniels	1

hm	0

and	1
so	0
i	1
decided	1
well	1
you	0
know	1
this	1
would	0
really	0
be	0
a	0
nice	1
dog	0
to	0
have	1
so	1
when	0
i	0
got	1
back	0
home	1
to	1
Carney	1
Nebraska	1
i	0
told	1
my	1
wife	1
about	0
it	0
and	1
i	0
said	1
you	0
know	1
this	1
is	0
just	0
a	0
i	1
i	0
can	1
just	0
hear	1
the	0
dog	0
crying	1
for	0
me	0
now	1

i	0
know	1
what	0
you	0
mean	1

and	0
and	0
Christmas	1
is	1
coming	1
up	0
you	0
know	1
hint	1
hint	1
and	0
so	0
i	1
had	1
to	1
go	0
back	1
the	1
next	1
week	1
as	0
well	1
as	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
other	1
people	0
from	1
the	0
university	1
and	0
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
uh	1
that	0
we	1
went	1
with	1
uh	1
they	1
were	0
friends	1
of	1
ours	0
and	1
so	1
we	1
uh	0
got	1
to	0
Omaha	1
and	0
i	0
decided	1
i'd	0
take	0
my	0
friend	1
over	0
and	0
show	1
him	0
the	0
dog	1
and	0
so	0
i	0
got	0
over	1
there	0
and	0
she	0
said	0
oh	1
that's	0
too	0
bad	1
the	0
dog	1
has	0
already	1
been	0
sold	1
and	0
i	0
didn't	0
realize	1
it	0
but	0
this	0
guy	1
had	0
somehow	1
worked	0
it	0
out	1
so	0
that	0
he	1
got	0
there	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
earlier	1
bought	1
the	0
dog	1
and	0
she	0
was	0
in	0
the	0
back	0
room	1
and	0
uh	0
so	0
that	0
night	1
we	0
had	0
a	0
reception	1
for	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
uh	0
potential	1
high	1
school	0
students	0
or	0
college	1
students	0
and	0
and	1
uh	0
he	1
had	0
the	0
dog	1
the	0
whole	0
time	1
in	0
his	0
room	1
and	0
and	0
i	1
had	0
no	0
idea	1
and	0
so	1
we	0
headed	1
back	0
to	0
Carney	1
that	0
night	0
and	0
the	0
dog	0
rode	1
in	0
the	0
car	1
and	0
we	0
stopped	1
along	0
the	0
way	1
and	0
had	0
a	0
bite	0
to	0
eat	1
and	0
they	0
left	1
the	0
dog	0
in	0
the	0
car	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
while	0
we	0
were	0
inside	0
eating	1
Thumper	1
just	0
tore	0
the	0
heck	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
inside	0
of	0
the	0
car	1
and	0
uh	0
finally	1
we	0
made	0
it	0
back	1
to	1
uh	0
to	0
Carney	1
and	0

[he]llo	1
Lynn	1

if	0
i	0
died	1
i'd	0
come	1
back	0
as	0
a	0
dog	1

what	0
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	0

oh	0

be	0
the	1
best	1
way	1
to	0
be	1

yeah	1
um	0
do	0
you	0
like	0
big	1
dogs	0
or	0
or	0
little	1

well	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
German	1
Shepherd	1
and	0

and	0
he	1
had	0
dysplasia	1

um-hum	0

and	0
he	1
had	1
it	1
for	0
about	0
three	1
or	1
four	0
years	1
where	0
we	0
just	1
about	0
had	0
to	0
lift	1
him	0
and	0
carry	1
him	0
every	1
place	1
he	0
went	1

really	1

so	1
when	1
he	1
died	1
we	0
got	0
a	0
little	1
one	1

yeah	1

but	0
our	1
Shepherd	1
was	0
almost	0
thirteen	1
years	0
old	1
and	0
it	0
just	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
was	0
almost	0
cruel	1
because	1

um-hum	0
almost	1

almost	1
cruel	1
for	0
him	0
to	0
to	0
walk	1

he	1
just	0

get	1
[laughter-something]	1
[laughter-little]	1
[laughter-that]	1
[laughter-if]	0
something	1
happened	1
it	0
would	0

sure	1

yeah	1
it	0

and	0
then	1
we've	0
had	0
three	1

in	0
an	0
apartment	1
and	0
like	0
our	0
cats	1
never	1
went	0
outside	1
but	1
um	0
the	0
neighbors	1
used	1
to	0
let	0

our	0
neighbors	1

i	0
don't	0

of	0
slimy	1
and	0
um	0
our	1
cats	0
wound	1
up	0
getting	0
fleas	1
um	0
from	0
the	0
apartment	1
that	0
we	0
were	0
in	1

um	1

so	1
we	1
had	0
to	0
we	0
had	0
to	0
flea	1
bath	0
them	0
and	0
that	0
was	1
uh	0
that	1
was	1
an	1
experience	1
that	0
they	1
didn't	0
enjoy	1
at	1
all	0

yeah	0
well	1
don't	1
even	0

i	0
when	0
i	1
was	1
single	1
i	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
for	1
the	1
weekend	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
my	1
husband	1
then	1
fiance	1
was	1
to	0
keep	1
my	0
cat	1
and	0
he	0
let	1
her	0
out	1
and	1
my	0
house	1
was	1
loaded	1
with	0
fleas	1
i	1
mean	0
you	0
walked	1
in	1
and	1
your	0
legs	1
were	0
just	0
black	1

really	1

and	0
we	1
had	0
such	1
a	0
time	1
and	0
never	1
got	0
the	0
cat	1
back	0

really	1

yeah	1
i	0
found	1
it	0
you	1
know	1
in	1
the	0
street	1

ah	0

was	1
a	1
social	1
worker	0
at	1
the	0
time	1
and	0
found	1
that	0
it	0

are	1
you	1
there	1

um-hum	1

okay	1
now	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
favorite	1
team	1

uh	1
baseball	1

yes	1

well	1
i've	1
been	1
kind	1
of	1
been	1
intrigued	1
with	1
the	1
Rangers	1
uh	1
more	1
so	1
with	1
uh	1
uh	0
their	1
management	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
i'd	1
i	0
don't	1
follow	1
baseball	1
that	0
that	1
closely	1
but	1
uh	0
si[nce]	1
you	1
know	1
since	0
i	0
live	1
here	0
so	1
close	1
to	1
Arlington	1
uh	1
that's	1
the	0
team	1
that	1
i've	1
been	1
kind	1
of	1
following	1

okay	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
for	1
them	1
to	0
assign	1
us	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
they're	1
headed	1
so	1
we'll	1
have	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
future	1
with	1
the	0
Rangers	1

um-hum	0

right	1

what	1
are	1
your	1
thinkings	1
on	1
what	1
they	1
can	1
do	1
what	1
they'll	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
do	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
uh	1
you	1
know	1
with	1
uh	0
so	1
much	0
controversy	1
over	1
Ruben	1
Sierra	1
not	1
signing	1
and	1
asking	1
us	1
for	1
so	0
much	1
money	1
it's	1
um	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
think	1
i'm	1
not	0
real	0
sure	1
about	0
th[at]	0
do	0
you	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
Ruben	1
Sierra's	1
uh	0

well	1
i	1
heard	1
tonight	1
on	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
he	1
is	0
willing	1
to	1
come	0
down	1
on	1
his	1

yeah	1
that	1
he	0
was	1
willing	1
to	1
come	0
down	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	0
uh	0
if	0
the	0
Rangers	1
will	0
go	0
up	1
a	0
little	1
bit	0
yeah	1

yes	1

and	1
the	1
Rangers	1
go	1
up	1
a	1
[laughter-little]	1
bit	1
um-hum	1

but	0
a	1
little	1
bit	0
from	0
three	1
you	0
know	1
from	1
thirty	1
million	1
dollars	1
or	0
thirty	0
five	1
mill[ion]	1
that's	1
a	1
lot	0
of	1
money	1

i	1
think	1
the	1
entire	1
baseball	1
yeah	1
they're	1
the	0
ones	1
that	0
probably	1
are	1
paying	1
the	1
highest	1

yeah	1
they	1
are	0

and	1
i	1
think	1
this	0
is	1
absolutely	1
ridiculous	1

um-hum	1

no	1

and	0
i	1
really	0
think	1
i	1
really	0
think	1
that	0
uh	1
that	0
they	1
ought	1
to	1
i'm	1
not	0
real	0
sure	1
that	0
they	1
should	0
pay	1
him	0
that	0
much	1
money	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
should	1
uh	1
uh	0
pay	1
him	1
what	1
his	0
salary's	1
going	0
to	0
be	1
uh	0
and	1
let	1
him	0
because	1
he's	1
got	0
one	1
more	0
year	1
before	0
he	0
turns	0
into	1
a	0
a	0
free	0
agent	1

that's	1
right	1

and	1
then	1
uh	0
who	1
knows	1
if	1
he	1
produces	1
next	1
year	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
end	1
up	1
paying	0
him	0
anyway	1
but	1
if	0
he	1
doesn't	1
then	1
his	0
market	1
value	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
they	1
can	1
pick	0
him	1
up	1
for	0
for	1
a	1
lot	0
less	1
than	1
than	1
they	1
would	1
uh	0
if	1
they	0
paid	1
him	0
the	0
si[x]	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
six	0
million	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
this	1
year	0

what	0
i	1
saw	1
on	1
the	0
news	1
today	1
that	0
Bue[chele]	0
Buechele	1
was	0
back	1
just	1
to	1
visit	1

uh-huh	1

i'm	1
awful	1
sorry	1
he's	1
not	1
still	1

oh	0
yeah	1
but	0
you	1
know	0
what	1
he	1
that	1
was	0
a	0
great	1
deal	1
for	1
him	1

oh	1
i'm	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1

yeah	1
it	1
was	0
a	0
great	1
deal	1
for	0
him	1
and	1
and	1
uh	1
he	1
just	1
signed	0
on	1
uh	0
i	0
think	1
it	1
was	0
like	1
a	1
five	1
year	0
deal	1
with	0
uh	0
Pittsburgh	1
so	0

Pittsburgh	1

yeah	1

so	0
you	1
know	0
he's	1
real	0
happy	0
there	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	0
Rangers	1
are	0
concerned	0
i	1
think	0
i	1
think	1
they	1
need	1
some	0
definitely	1
need	0
some	0
pitching	1

yes	1
sir	0

uh	0
and	0
so	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
i	0

well	0
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
Howse	1
who	1
is	0
the	1
coach	1
for	0
the	0
pitchers	1

the	1
pitching	1
coach	1

yes	1

well	0
you	1
know	1
i	1
was	0
just	1
looking	1
at	1
the	0
news	1
tonight	1
and	1
they	1
showed	1
a	1
a	1
a	1
black	1
guy	1
that	1
was	0
go[ing]	0
was	1
helping	1
out	1
uh	0
his	0
assistant	1
and	0

his	1
assistant	1

um-hum	0

and	0
i	1
think	1
that's	0
a	0
a	1
great	0
addition	1
i	1
mean	0
he	1
seemed	1
to	0
know	0
what	0
he	0
was	1
doing	1
and	1
and	1
uh	0

i	1
really	1
wish	1
they	1
could	0
see	1
fit	1
to	0
get	0
rid	1
of	0
Howse	0

oh	0
you	0
don't	1
like	0
Howse	1
huh	0

no	1
no	1
i	0
really	1
don't	0

and	0
i'm	1
not	1
[laughter-going]	1
to	0
stand	1
up	0
you	1
know	1
on	0
my	0
soapbox	1
and	0
say	1
that	0

but	0
i'm	0
not	1
fond	0
of	1
Howse	1
and	0

and	0
i'm	1
not	0
fond	1
of	0
Grieves	1

oh	0
Tom	1
Grieve	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
i'm	1
i'm	1
not	0
sure	1
that	0
um	1
that	0
they're	0
ready	1
to	1
get	0
rid	1
of	0
of	0
uh	0
Tom	0
Grieve	1
yet	0
but	1
Howse	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
different	1
uh	1
situation	1
and	0
i	1
think	0
you're	1
probably	1
right	1
that	1
they	1
that	1
they	0
need	1
some	0
you	1
know	1
some	0
changes	1
in	0
uh	1
pitching	1
coach	1
maybe	1
and	0
um	1

well	0
i'm	1
just	0
gullible	1
enough	1
that	0
i	1
think	1
Bobby	0
Valentine	1
is	0
um	0
uh	0
doing	0
all	0
right	1
and	0
i'm	1
sure	1

you	0
do	1
huh	0

well	1

that's	0
contrary	1
to	0
uh	0
popular	1
belief	1
you	0
know	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1
i	0
[laughter-know]	1
so	1
but	0
i	1
would	0
like	1
so	1
much	1
for	0
these	1
Rangers	1
to	0
get	0
their	0
act	1
together	1
and	0
give	1
um	0
oh	0
uh	0
Nolan	1
Ryan	1
the	0
support	1
he	0
needs	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
too	0
bad	1
that	0
uh	0
it	0
has	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
forty	1
two	0
year	0
old	0
guy	1
to	0
to	0
lead	1
the	0
uh	1
the	1
Rangers	1
you	1
know	1

i	1
understand	1

they	0
need	1
to	0
have	1
some	0
some	0
young	1
guys	1
that	0
can	0
take	0
the	0
lead	1
and	0
and	0
uh	1
yeah	0

well	1
i	1
just	0
oh	1
i	1
have	0
so	0
many	1
mixed	0
emotions	1
about	1
all	1
this	1
but	1

but	1
i	1
think	1
with	0
their	1
new	1
stadium	1
they	1
should	0
go	1
and	0
let's	1
us	0

[o]kay	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
they	1
said	1
i've	1
written	1
this	1
down	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
is	1
it	1
p[ossible]	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
it's	1
possible	1
to	1
have	1
honesty	1
in	1
government	1
or	1
an	1
honest	1
government	1

okay	1
you're	1
asking	1
what	1
my	1
opinion	1
about	1
whether	1
[laughter-it's]	1
[laughter-possible]	1
to	1
have	1
honesty	1
in	1
government	1

yeah	1

well	1
i	1
suspect	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
uh	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
probably	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
if	0
you	1
have	1
a	1
small	1
government	1
unit	1
where	1
everybody	1
knows	1
everybody	1

right	1
that's	1
a	1
good	1
point	1

but	1
um	1
other	1
than	1
that	1
i	1
think	1
maybe	1
it	1
just	1
depends	1
on	1
how	1
you	1
define	1
honesty	1

that's	1
an	0
int[eresting]	0
yeah	1
that's	0
interesting	1
i	1
had	1
read	1
something	1
one	0
time	1
and	0
it	0
was	1
just	1
applying	1
to	1
governments	1
in	0
general	1
it	0
was	1
written	1
many	1
years	1
ago	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
is	0
impossible	1
to	1
have	1
a	0
completely	1
honest	1
system	1
of	1
government	1
because	1
people	1
who	1
choose	1
government	1
for	1
their	1
positions	1
are	1
power	1
seekers	1
and	1
i	1
thought	0
that	1
was	1
interesting	1
it	1
wasn't	1
just	1
talking	1
about	1
our	1
government	0
it	0
was	0
just	0
government	1
in	0
general	1
from	0
times	0
past	1
you	0
know	0
on	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1

so	1
they're	1
saying	1
that	1
government	1
officials	1
would	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
power	1
seekers	1

right	0
and	1
that	1
would	1
be	0
a	1
next	1
question	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
many	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
are	0
in	1
there	0
for	0
pub[lic]	1
for	0
but	0
because	1
they	0
wanna	0
be	1
of	0
service	1
to	1
us	0
or	1
are	1
they	1
in	0
there	1
for	0
their	1
own	1
gains	1
and	0
personally	1
i	1
feel	1
it's	1
probably	1
there's	1
probably	1
some	1
of	1
each	1

right	1
yeah	1
but	1
i	1
think	1
maybe	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
them	0
um	1
say	1
the	0
more	1
honest	1
ones	1
who	0
are	1
still	1
looking	1
out	0
for	1
themselves	1
it	0
may	1
be	1
more	1
a	1
matter	1
of	0
not	1
what	1
can	1
i	1
steal	1
while	1
i'm	1
in	1
office	1
but	1
how	0
many	1
friends	1
can	1
i	1
make	1
while	1
i'm	1
in	1
office	1
and	1

um-hum	0

yeah	0

and	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
good	1
a	1
name	1
can	1
i	1
make	1
for	0
myself	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
so	0
i	1
guess	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
like	1
anything	1
else	1
the	0

yeah	1

the	0
president	1
of	1
General	0
Motors	1
probably	1
has	1
the	0
same	1

oh	0
yeah	0

and	0
they	1
talked	1
uh	0
the	1
other	1
let's	1
see	1
third	1
question	0
was	1
how	0
m[uch]	1
how	1
much	0
self-serving	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
gains	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
goes	1
on	1
then	0
they	0
that's	1
hard	1
to	0
answ[er]	1
i'm	1
sure	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
but	1
i	0
agree	1
with	0
you	0
there's	0
a	1
lot	0
in	0
business	1
i	0
think	1
that's	1
just	1
i	1
think	1
that's	1
very	1
normal	1
that	0
we	0
should	1
not	1
ex[pect]	1
i	1
mean	0
i	0

i	1
think	1
i'm	1
i	1
think	1
a	0
little	1
more	0
honesty	1
in	0
campaigns	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
to	0
the	1
point	1

i	0
think	1
we	1
put	0
too	0
much	1
on	0
politicians	1
we	1
expect	1
them_1	1
to	0
only	1
be	1
there	0
to	0
serve	1
us	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

if	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
getting	1
when	1
you	0
voted	1
uh	1

that's	1
a	0
problem	1
isn't	1
it	1

yeah	1

it's	0
interesting	1
because_1	0
i'm	1
taking	1
a	1
Texas	0
government	1
class	0
right	1
now	1
and	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	1
i	1
always	0
reali[ze]	1
it's	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
blame	1
them	1
to	0
b[lame]	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
times	1
i	0
think	1
it's	1
our	0
own	1
fault	1
they	1
lie	1
to	0
us	1
because	0
we	1
don't	0
wanna	1
hear	1
the	0
truth	1

yeah	1
they	0
say	1
you	1
get	1
the	1
government	1
you	1
deserve	1

and	0
if	0

if	1
they	1
tell	1
us	1
the	0
truth	1
we	1
don't	0
elect	1
them_1	1
and	0
especially	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
front	1
co[ver]	0
stuff	1
coming	1
up	0
here	1
lately	1
about	1
people's	1
past	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
why	0
anybody	1
would	0
wanna	0
get	0
under	0
that	0
scrutiny	1
anymore	1

it's	0
hard	1
to	0
imagine	1

because	0
it's	0
i	1
think	1
it's	0
gotten	1
just	0
care[less]	1
well	1
we're	0

we're	0
not	1
talking	1
about	0
issues	1
we're	0
talking	1
about	1
somebody's	1
personal	1
life	1
and	0
and	1
we're	1
getting	0
away	1
from	1
what	0
we	0
ought	0
to	0
be	0
looking	1
at	0

yeah	1
and	1
it	0
almost	1
seems	1
like	0
in	1
order	0
to	0
avoid	1
uh	0
some	0
of	0
this	0
scandal	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
to	0
have	1
the	0
kind	0
of	0
life	1
that	0
you	1
would	1
only	1
find	1
in	1
a	1
say	1
in	1
the	1
Bobsy	1
Twins	1
or	1
something	1
like	0
that	1

right	1

you	1
know	0
i	1
also	1
think	1
it'd	1
be	0
funny	1
if	0
we	1
could	0
kn[ow]	1
know	1
everything	1
about	1
the	0
people	1
that	0
were	1
in	1
there	0
and	0
threw	0
them_1	0
out	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
there	0
would	0
be	0
too	0
many	1
[laughter-left]	1

so	1
you're	1
taking	1
a	1
government	1
course	1

um-hum	0

at	1
what	1
at	0
the	1
university	1

uh	0
at	0
uh	0
it's	0
TCJC	1
Tex[as]	0
Tarrant	1
County	0
Junior	1
College	0

oh	1

yeah	0

okay	0

and	1
it's	1
really	1
it's	1
really	0
enjoyable	1
i	0
like	1
it	0
and	0
they	0
also	1
you	1
know	0
ask	1
can	0
we	0
eliminate	1
do	0
you	0
think	1
we	0
could	0
make	0
laws	1
to	0
eliminate	1
all	0
corruption	1
and	0
i	1
don't	0
think	1
we	0
can	1
make	1
laws	1
to	1
eliminate	1
anything	1
anyplace	1
totally	1

you	0
can	0
make	0
laws	1
against	1
corruption	0
[laughter-but]	0

yeah	0
but	0
that	1
doesn't	0
mean	1

[laughter-but]	0
[laughter-that]	1
[laughter-doesn't]	0
eliminate	1
it	0
does	1
it	0

i	1
don't	0
think	1
making	0
laws	1
will	0
stop	1
it	0
i	1
mean	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
how	1
many	0
laws	1
you'd	1
have	0
to	1
have	1
i	1
mean	1
you	1

well	1
they've	0
got	1
laws	1
against	1
canni[balism]	1
cannibalism	1
but	1
that	1
didn't	1
stop	1
that	1
guy	1
in	1
Milwaukee	1
did	1
it	0

no	1
sure	0
didn't	1
did	1
it	0

so	0
no	1
i	0
think	1
you	0
can	0
legislate	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
there's	0
no	1
way	1
that	0
you'd	0
eliminated	0
all	1
by	0
legislating	1
and	0
we'd	1
end	1
up	0
with	0
so	1
many	0
more	0
laws	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
just	0
think	1
that's	0
human	1
nature	1
that	0
you're	0
gonna	1
have	0
corruption	1
in	0
government	1
in	1
business	1
personal	1
life	1
i	1
mean	0
you	1
know	0

actually	1
i	0
think	0
other	1
countries	1
may	0
have	0
it	0
worse	1
uh	0
the	1
Japanese	1
government	0
is	1
always	1
having	1
a	0
some	1
kind	0
of	0
a	0
scandal	1

right	1

usually	1
involving	1
the	0
Prime	0
Minister	1
or	0
people	0
very	0
close	1
to	0
him	0
it's	0

yeah	0

so	0
uh	0

yeah	1
i	1
still	1
believe	1
i	1
get	1
very	0
fed	1
up	1
with	0
government	0
sometimes	1
but	1
when	0
i	0
think	1
about	0
where	1
i'd	0
wanna	0
go	1
you	1
know	0
this	0
is	0
still	1
the	0
best	1
or	0
i	1
can	0

yeah	1
i've	0
been	1
around	0
to	1
a	0
few	1
other	0
countries	1
and	0
i	0
uh	0
i	0
i	0
have	0
not	1
found	1
one	1
yet	1
that	0
i	1
would	0
rather	0
live	1
in	0
i	1
think	1
uh	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
at	1
it's	0
worst	1
i	0
think	1
we've	0
got	0
the	0
best	1

anyway	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
first	1
comments	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1

uh	1
my	1
first	1
comments	1
on	1
the	1
budget	1
i	1
would	1
say	1
there	0
has	1

what	1
would	1
you	1
start	1
cutting	1
f[irst]	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
you'd	0
cut	1
defense	1

surprisingly	1
no	1
i	0
would	1
i	1
would	1
cut	1
the	0
prison	1
systems	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
self-support	1

mean	1
private	1
enterprise	1

hm	1

have	1
private	1
enter[prise]	1
enterprise	1
do	1
it	1

you	1
mean	1
the	1
prisons	1

uh-huh	1
they're	1
already	0
talking	1
about	0
it	1
i	1
mean	1
they're	1
talking	1
about	1
um	1
having	1
it	1
uh	1
as	1
a	1
you	1
know	0
business	1
uh	0
to	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
to	0
so	1
the	1
you	0
know	1
the	0
government	1
doesn't	1
have	0
to	1
deal	1
with	0
it	1

i	1
hadn't	1
heard	1
that	1

but	1
uh	1
yeah	1
because	1
i	0
think	1
it's	1
all	1
funded	1
either	1
state	1
or	1
federally	1
funded	1
so	1
or	1
uh	0
obvious[ly]	1
so	1

right	1

so	1
but	1
um	1
but	1
see	1
they're	1
they	1
don't	1
have	1
enough	1
um	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
there's	1
there's	0
not	1
enough	1
room	1
in	0
these	1
prisons	1
and	0
that	1
and	0
that	1
uh	0
to	0
continue	1
funding	1
it	0
they	1

but	1
to	0
me	1
well	0

they	1
think	1
they	0
need	1
to	1
maybe	1
have	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
private	1
you	1
know	0
business	1
private	1
enterprise	1
come	1
in	1
so	1

well	0
see	1
the	0
other	1
way	0
i'm	1
thinking	1
about	0
is	0
they	0
should	1
be	0
self-supporting	1
like	0
um	1
the	0
prisoners	1
make	1
license	1
plates	0
or	0
farm	1
or	0
small	1
industry	1
inside	1
the	0
prisons	1
anything	1
to	0
where	1
they	0
can	0
be	0
self-supporting	1
within	0
themselves	1
in	0
other	1
words	1
they're	1
in	1
there	0
for	0
a	1
purpose	1
put	1
them	0
to	1
work	1
rather	1
than	0
sitting	1
there	0

um-hum	1

it's	0
the	0
same	1
thing	0
like	1
the	0
whole	1
criminal	1
i	0
shouldn't	1
say	1
criminal	1
but	0
the	1
whole	0
police	1
department	1
of	0
the	1
United	1
States	1
i	0
feel	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
uh	1
someone	1
gets	1
picked	0
up	1
for	1
drunk	1
driving	1
he	1
should	1
put	1
enough	1
in	1
there	1
that	1
goes	1
back	1
into	1
paying	1
for	0
that	1
policeman	1
being	1
out	1
there	1

um-hum	1

so	0
it's	0
self	1
defen[se]	1
you	1
know	0
self-defense	1
on	0
that	0
point	1
um	0
as	0
far	1
as	1
my	0
defense	1
budget	1
uh	0
they're	1
cutting	1
it	0
back	1
now	1
what	1
twenty	1
five	1
percent	1
i	0
wouldn't	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
cut	1
any	1
more	1
than	0
that	1

yeah	1

but	0
again	1
i'd	0
like	1
to	0
see	0
something	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
back	1
into	0
education	1
but	0
not	1
in	0
the	0
education	1
we	1
have	0
today	1
so	1
i'm	1
lost	1
on	1
that	1
one	1
i	1
would	0
like	1
to	1
be	1
a	0
little	1
more	1
into	1
investigating	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
other	1
countries	1
in	0
the	0
world	1
and	1
their	1
educational	0
problems	1
and	0
to	0
come	1
up	1
with	1
something	1
a	1
little	0
better	1
than	0
what	1
we've	1
got	1

um-hum	1
yeah	1
its	0
tough	1
to	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
um	1
you	0
know	1
what	1
uh	0
as	1
far	1
as	1
this	1
that	1
good	1
or	0
bad	1
or	0
what	1
but	0
uh	1
i	0
was	0
just	1
talking	1
to	0
somebody	0
else	1
and	0
all	0
those	0
European	1
countries	1
they	0
pay	1
all	1
the	0
way	1
through	1
college	1
and	0
stuff	1
like	1
that	0
they	1
so	1
uh	1

well	1
not	1
so	0
much	0
pay	1
i'm	1
not	1
trying	1
to	0
see	0
the	0
government	0
put	1
out	1
any	0
more	1

no	1
yeah	1
i	0
know	1
what	0
you	1
are	1
saying	1
but	0
i'm	1
just	0
saying	1
that	0
even	1
the	0
differences	1
uh	0
is	1
that	1
you	1
know	0
some	0
countries	1
pay	1
for	0
students	1
to	0
go	1
to	1
through	1
college	1
and	0
etcetera	1
but	0
here	1
it	1
you	1
know	0
it's	0
just	0
up	1
to	0
high	1
school	0

yeah	1
but	1
see	1
we	1
don't	0
even	1
push	1
the	0
fact	1
to	0
the	0
high	1
school	0
kids	1
that	0
there's	0
other	1
means	1
of	0
education	1
out	1
there	1
rather	1
than	0
college	1
to	1
go	1
either	1
as	0
an	1
apprentice	1
which	1
they	1
they	1
do	1
in	1
other	1
countries	1
just	0
doing	1
this	0
which	1
i	1
think	1
would	1
bring	1
the	1
education	1
back	1
up	1
you	1
know	1
why	1

hum-um	1

why	1
not	1
an	1
apprentice	1
out	0
to	1
a	0
a	0
company	1
and	0
learn	1
from	1
down	1
on	0
the	1
bottom	1
as	0
a	1
wood	1
worker	1
or	1
you	1
know	0
just	1
a	0
technician	1
you	0
can	0
learn	1
on	0
the	0
job	1
which	1
of	0
course	1
again	1
which	1
m[ean]	1
would	1
mean	1
again	1
our	1

um-hum	1

our	1
education	1
budget	1
will	1
go	0
down	1
if	1
this	1
is	0
in	1
a	1
few	0
years	1
i	1
mean	1
it's	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
be	1
overnight	1

yeah	1

but	0
that	1
would	1
come	1
down	1

i	0
think	1
the	0
pro[gram]	1
you	1
know	0
that's	1
one	0
reason	1
uh	1
you	0
know	1
we	0
do	1
have	0
the	1
education	1
is	0
that	1
what	1
it	0
takes	1
for	1
these	0
companies	1
to	0
bring	1
somebody	0
on	0
board	1
uh	1
they're	1
not	1
willing	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
to	1
put	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
training	1
for	1
only	1
a	0
certain	0
amount	1
so	1

so	1
um	1
it's	1
you	1
know	0
as	0
far	0
as	1
the	1
technical	1
side	1
but	1
uh	0
even	1
like	1
one	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
biggest	1
things	1
now	1
is	0
like	1
paralegals	1
and	0
stuff	1
i	0
mean	1
they	1
they're	1
trying	1
to	0
get	1
more	0
people	1
into	0
that	1
field	1
but	0
they	1
can't	1
just	0
bring	1
somebody	0
in	1
without	1
even	0
having	1
gone	1
to	1
you	1
know	0
school	1
in	0
that	0
area	1
before	1
they	0
can	0
work	1
you	1
know	0
for	0
a	0
lawyer	1
as	0
a	0
paralegal	1

excuse	1
me	0
i	0
see	1
it	0
being	0
done	1
i	1
know	1
of	0
a	0
friend	1
that	0
works	0
for	0
my	1
lawyer	1
that	0
has	0
had	0
no	1
training	0
whatsoever	1
and	0
she's	1
training	1
her	1

um-hum	1
well	0
yeah	1
i	1
i'm	1
well	1
ye[ah]	0
i	1
you	1
know	0
i'm	0
assuming	1
that	0
it	0
can	1
be	0
done	1
uh	0
my	1
perspective	1
is	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
been	1
with	0
a	0
couple	1
of	0
big	0
companies	1
now	0
and	0
it's	1
like	1
they'd	1
are	0
unwilling	1
to	0
put	1
the	0
time	1
in	1
you	1
know	0
they	1
want	1
somebody	1
you	1
know	0
when	0
they	1
then	0
when	0
they	1
bring	1
them	0
off	1
bring	1
them	1
in	1
that	0
they	1
have	0
something	1
you	1
know	0
a	0
certain	1
amount	1
to	0
contribute	1
obviously	1
there's	0
uh	0
uh	0
you	1
know	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
to	0
learn	1
uh	0
after	0
that	1
but	1
but	1
uh	0
that's	1
true	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
um	0
you	1
know	1
businesses	1
are	0
small	1
you	1
know	0
small	1
businesses	1
that	0
could	1
uh	0
let	1
me	0
change	1
my	0
channel	1
i've	1
got	1
a	0
cordless	1
phone	1
let	0
me	0
see	1
if	0
that	1
clears	1
this	0
up	1
is	0
that	1
better	1

yes	1

okay	1

wow	1

an[d]	1
yeah	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
cordless	1
phone	1
and	0
all	1
of	1
a	0
sudden	1
we	0
had	1
a	0
bad	1
uh	0
frequency	1
there	0
or	0
something	1
so	1
we	0
had	1
some	0
interference	1
so	0
i	0
changed	1
that	0

yeah	1
it	0
sounded	1
you	0
were	0
calling	1
from	1
around	0
the	1
world	1
[laughter-somewhere]	1

anyway	1
so	1
um	0

we[ll]	1

but	0
uh	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
they	0
maybe	1
they	0
need	0
to	1
uh	0
help	1
promote	1
that	0
more	1
give	1
incentives	1
like	1
uh	0
if	0
they	0
do	1
bring	0
somebody	1
on	0
they	1
will	1
pay	1
some	0
of	0
their	0
costs	1
or	0
give	1
tax	1
breaks	0
or	0
whatever	1
it	0
is	0
you	0
know	1
for	0
them	1
to	0
train	1
people	0
you	1
know	0
stuff	1
like	0
that	1
programs	1
like	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
i	1

um-hum	1

i	1
don't	0
know	1
you	1
know	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0
options	1
they've	0
got	1

well	0
that's	1
something	1
about	0
what	0
Germany's	1
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
doing	1
something	1
similar	1
to	0
that	0
right	0
now	1
and	1
uh	0
they	0
have	0
jobs	1
out	1
on	0
you	1
know	0
bulletin	1
boards	1
so	0
people	0
know	1
what	0
is	0
open	1
for	0
an	0
apprentices	1
in	0
different	0
fields	1
but	0
see	1
that	1
again	1
would	0
cut	0
some	1
of	1
our	0
budget	1
down	0
for	0
education	1
but	0
build	1
up	0
our	1
education	1
with	0
the	0
people	1
at	1
people	1
per	0
at	1
high	1
school	0
level	1
which	0
i	0
would	0
like	1
to	0
see	1
rather	1
than	1
so	1
many	1
kids	0
getting	0
out	1
of	1
school	1
they're	0

uh-huh	1

they're	0
they	0
go	1
on	1
the	0
unemployment	1
list	0
before	0
we	1
have	0
turn	0
around	1
because	1
they	0
don't	1
have	1
any	0
education	1

um-hum	1

i	1
don't	1
mean	0
college	1
and	1
i'm	1
for	0
college	1
but	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	1
people	0
that	0
don't	0
want	1
their	0
higher	1
education	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
quote	0
quote	0
college	1
is	0
concerned	1
they've	0
had	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
just	0
heard	1
something	1
the	0
other	0
day	1
it	1
was	0
like	0
only	1
it	0
was	0
either	0
sixty	1
percent	1
or	0
forty	1
percent	1
go	1
to	0
college	1
and	0
then	1
out	0
of	0
that	1
percentage	1
only	1
so	1
many	0
can	0
get	1
their	0
degree	1

um-hum	1

so	1
i	0
thought	0
that	1
was	1
interesting	1
but	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
most	1
people	0
i	1
knew	1
have	0
gone	1
and	0
got	0
their	0
degree	1
so	1

oh	1
yeah	1
but	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them	0
out	0
there	0
that	1
haven't	1

yeah	1
well	1
i	1
ju[st]	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
uh	0
was	1
basic	1
in	1
a	0
you	0
know	1
middle	1
upper	0
middle	1
class	1
area	1
and	1

that's	1

and	1
yeah	1
so	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
that	1
demographic	1
area	0
there	1
you	0
know	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
them	1
do	1
go	0
on	1
and	1
they	0
go	1
to	0
college	1
etcetera	1

well	1
it	0
seems	1
to	0
me	1
that	0
kids	1
that	0
a[re]	0
get	1
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0
that	0
parents	1
have	0
gone	1
to	0
college	1
and	0
college	1
here	1
and	0
college	1
there	1
that	0
are	0
really	1
not	1
interested	1
in	0
going	1
to	0
college	1
and	0
forced	0
into	1
it	0
usually	1
are	0
your	0
drop	1
outs	0
where	1
if	0
they're	0
said	1
hey	1
it's	0
just	1
as	0
advisable	1
to	0
go	0
into	0
something	0
you	0
enjoy	1
and	0
you	1
like	1
because	0
you	1
can	0
get	1
just	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
being	1
a	0
journeyman	1
carpenter	1
or	0
an	0
electrician	1
or	0
plumber	1
or	0
anything	1
else	1
like	0
that	0
make	0
as	0
much	1
money	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
enjoy	1
it	0
more	1
they'll	1
make	1
a	0
lo[t]	1
happier	1
life	1
for	0
themselves	1

yeah	1

question	1
you	0
threw	1
that	0
question	1
on	0
me	1
about	0
the	0
deficit	1
put	0
it	1
on	0
your	1
shoe	0
now	1
what	1
would	0
you	1
do	1

well	1
as	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
the	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
deficit	1
that's	1
a	0
whole	1
nother	1
uh	1
my	1
perception	1
of	1
the	0
budget	1
you	1
know	0
the	0
government	1
and	0
they	1
have	0
so	1
much	0
to	0
spend	1
and	0
there's	1
not	1
enough	0
money	1
to	0
spread	0
around	1
but	0
the	0
deficit	1
basically	1
is	1
that	0
the	0
trade	1
surplus	0
between	1
the	0
other	0
countries	1
and	1
that	0
we	0
have	1
more	0
money	1
or	0
goo[ds]	1
you	0
know	1
more	0
money	1
going	0
out	1
and	0
too	1
many	0
goods	1
coming	0
into	1
this	0
country	1
you	0
know	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
part	1
of	0
that	1
problem	1
i	0
think	1
is	0
still	1
you	0
know	1
uh	0
like	0
Japan	1
still	1
does	0
not	1
let	0
us	0
compete	1
fairly	1
in	1
their	0
country	1
and	1
and	0
obviously	1
the	1
the	0
demand	1
for	0
their	1
goods	1
is	0
quite	1
high	1
here	0
so	1
they	1
can	0
get	0
their	1
goods	1
in	0
here	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
to	0
start	1
even	1
that	0
out	1
we	0
need	1
to	0
continue	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
at	0
least	0
threaten	1
that	0
you	1
know	0
we're	0
going	1
to	0
give	1
them	1
higher	1
tariffs	1
etcetera	1
to	0
raise	1
their	1
prices	1
to	0
you	1
know	1
ours	1
but	1
um	0
it's	0
just	1
that	1
uh	0
they're	1
in	1
i	1
think	1
you're	1
you're	1
going	0
to	0
find	1
that	0
just	0
because	0
the	0
United	1
States	1
you	1
know	0
there	0
is	0
such	1
a	0
demand	1
here	0
the	0
market	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
uh	0
uh	0
the	0
mon[ey]	1
you	0
know	0
money	1
being	0
spent	1
and	0
the	0
goods	1
flow	0
in	1
and	1
we	0
don't	0
sell	1
you	1
know	0
we	0
don't	1
uh	0
sell	0
products	1
abroad	1
as	0
much	1
as	0
we	0
bring	0
in	1
so	1

were	0
you	0
watching	1
i	0
think	1
uh	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
news	1
stations	0
i	0
couldn't	1
even	0
tell	1
you	0
which	1
one	0
i	0
watched	1
but	0
they	0
had	1
on	0
there	1
where	1
the	1
the	1
output	1
from	0
the	0
United	0
States	1
was	0
basically	1
from	0
smaller	1
businesses	0
rather	1
than	0
the	0
larger	1
ones	0
are	0
exporting	1

hum-um	1

okay	1
um	1
Chuck	1
do	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
pets	1
there	1
at	1
your	1
home	1

yeah	1
i	1
do	1

and	1
what	1
kind	1
do	1
you	1
have	1

i've	1
got	1
a	1
male	1
Siamese	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
old	1
here	1
i	1
live	1
alone	1
in	1
an	1
apartment	1
and	1
uh	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
cat	1

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	0

how	1
about	1
you	1

well	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
cat	1
um	1
he's	1
probably	1
oh	0
a	0
good	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
big	1
old	1
fat	1
and	0
sassy	1
tabby	1

uh-huh	1

oh	1
uh	0
how's	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
your	1
Siamese	1
cat	1

well	1
it's	1
uh	0
you	1
know	1
they're	1
just	1
uh	1
aggressive	1
by	0
nature	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	1
he's	1
been	0
neutered	1
and	0
declawed	1
so	0
and	1
he's	1
an	1
indoor	1
cat	1
so	1

uh-huh	1

so	1
uh	1
uh	1
that	0
kind	1
of	1
calms	1
him	1
down	1
for	0
the	1
most	1
part	1

how	0
about	1
yours	1

well	1
yeah	1
he's	1
uh	0
he	0
has	1
been	1
really	1
aggressive	1
at	0
especially	1
towards	1
my	0
little	1
girl	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1

huh	0

he's	0
uh	1
been	0
so	1
mean	1
to	0
her	1

and	1
and	0
you	0
say	1
you	0
had	0
him	0
how	1
long	1

we've	1
had	1
him	1
for	0
about	1
two	1
years	1
and	1

two	1
years	1

and	1
and	1
he	0
was	1
so	1
mean	1
to	0
her	1
um	0
right	0
after	1
we	0
first	0
got	1
him	0
so	1
we	0
had	1
him	0
neutered	1
and	0
and	0
declawed	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
bites	1
her	0
[laughter-he]	1
[laughter-can't]	1
scratch	1
her	0
[laughter-anymore]	1
he	1

huh	0

he	1
bites	1
her	0

does	0
he	0
bite	1
her	1
enough	1
to	0
draw	0
blood	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
couple	0
of	1
times	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
he's	1
a	1
very	1
possessive	1
cat	1
he	1
he	1
loves	1
my	1
son	1
it's	0
his	1
cat	1
and	1
he's	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
that	0
allows	1
him	1
to	1
touch	1
him	1
or	1
pet	1
him	1
or	1
love	1
him	1

yeah	1

and	1
he's	1
so	0
funny	1
he	1
just	0
follows	1
my	0
son	1
around	1
just	1
like	1
a	0
dog	1

huh	0

he	1
won't	1
even	1
let	1
my	0
son	1
shower	1

yeah	1

he	1
meows	1
and	0
wants	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
the	1
bathroom	1
and	0
while	1
he	1
showers	1
it's	0
so	1
hilarious	1
so	0
he's	1
quite	1
a	1
animal	1

yeah	1
boy	1
i	0
guess	1
well	0
as	0
long	1
as	0
he	0
doesn't	0
get	0
too	1
aggressive	1
i	0
guess	1
with	0
the	0
daughter	1
he's	1
all	1
right	0
you	0

yeah	1

you	0
wouldn't	0
want	1
him	0
to	0
carry	1
her	0
off	1
or	0
something	0

yeah	1
well	1
we	1
we	1
did	1
uh	1
actually	0
take	0
him	1
to	0
the	1
pound	1
a	1
couple	1
of	0
times	1
you	1
know	1
because_1	1
we	1
just	0
couldn't	1
have	1
him	0
being	1
so	1
so	1
aggressive	1
towards	0
the	1
girl	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

sure	1

but	0
uh	0
he	1
seems	1
to	0
have	1
mellowed	1
out	1
a	0
little	1
bit	1
and	0
we	0
do	1
keep	1
our	1
daughter	1
away	1
from	0
him	1
so	1

yeah	1
yeah	0

were	1
it	0
not	1
for	1
my	0
son	1
the	0
cat	1
would	0
not	0
be	1
in	0
this	0
house	1

is	0
that	1
the	0
only	1
pet	0
that	0
you	1
have	1

it	1
is	1
uh-huh	1

we	0
tried	1
a	1
dog	1
um	1

four	1
years	0
ago	1
and	1
we	1
ended	0
up	1
with	0
a	1
oh	1
Malamute	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
kind	1
of	1
mix	1
anyway	1

ended	1
up	1
being	0
just	1
a	0
huge	1
huge	0
dog	1
that	0
ate	1
us	0
out	0
of	1
house	1
and	0
home	1
so	0

and	1
tried	0

well	1
do	1
you	1
live	1
you	0

in	0
a	1
house	1
or	0
a	0
place	1
where	0

to	1
say	1
even	1

uh	0
well	1
it	1
it's	0

i	1
kind	1
of	1
like	1
some	1

the	1
monotonous	1
no	1

actually	1
gets	0
into	0
some	1
serious	1
discussions	1
of	0
problems	1
in	0
our	0
in	0
urban	1
society	1

that	0
much	1
except	1
for	0
once	1
in	0
a	0
while	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
funny	1
more	0
satire	1
kind	0
some	1
times	0

um-hum	1

um	0
i'm	1

but	0
um	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
time	0
anyway	1
i	0
like	0
easy	1
listening	1
just	0
kind	1
of	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
guess	0
i	1
don't	1
care	1
much	0
for	1
rock	1
and	0
roll	1
any	1
more	0
i	1
used	1
to	0
like	0
it	0
all	0
right	0
but	0
i	1
don't	0
really	0
care	0
to	1
listen	1
to	0
it	1
any	1
more	0
for	1
some	1
reason	1
um	0
let's	1
see	1
country	1
western	1
uh	0
i'm	0
not	0
quite	1
as	0
big	0
on	0
that	0
some	1
of	0
it's	1
okay	0
um	0

yeah	1
that's	0
that's	1
about	0
my	0
opinion	0
of	1
that	1

yeah	1

it's	1
it's	1
okay	1
um	0

some	1
of	0
it	0
kind	1
of	0
falls	0
in	0
the	0
rap	1
category	0
i	0
guess	1
[laughter-so]	0

hm	1
the	0
thing	1
about	0
country	0
western	1
that	0
i	1
don't	1
enjoy	1
is	1
is	1
doesn't	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
imagination	1
behind	1
it	0

yeah	1

the	0
one	1
country	0
and	0
western	0
song	0
sounds	0
like	0
every	1
other	1
country	0
and	0
western	0

a	0
lot	1
of	1
them_1	1
sound	1
uh	1
really	1
similar	1
yeah	1

yeah	1

and	1
so	1
the	0
the	0
musicians	1
don't	1
get	1
to	0
really	1
get	0
into	0
their	1
music	1
they	1
just	0
play	1
a	0
certain	1
number	1
of	0
chords	1

yeah	0

the	1
drummer	1
plays	0
a	1
certain	0
beat	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
country	1
and	1
western	1
song	1

hm	1

and	1

well	1
that's	1
kind	1
of	0
the	0
way	1
i	0
feel	1
about	0
rock	0
and	0
roll	1
sometimes	1
too	1
i	1
guess	1
they	0
don't	1
really	1
has	1
kind	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sound	1
over	1
and	0
over	1
and	0
the	0
other	1
thing	0
i	0
don't	0
like	0
about	0
it	0
is	1
they	0
have	0
a	0
tendency	1
to	0
play	1
the	0
instrumental	1
so	0
loud	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
understand	1
what	0
the	0
lyrics	1
are	0

hm	0
right	1

you	0
can't	1
understand	1
what	0
they're	0
saying	1
on	0
some	0
of	0
those	0
songs	1
which	1
probably	1
is	1
just	0
as	0
well	1
on	1
[laughter-some]	1
[laughter-of]	1
[laughter-them]	0
[laughter-too]	1

yeah	1
and	0
i	0
can't	1
say	1
that	0
i	1
like	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
the	0
modern	1
the	1
very	1
very	1
modern	1
uh	0
rock	1
and	0
roll	1
but	1

yeah	0

but	1
i	0
i	0
definitely	1
i	0
really	1
enjoy	0
the	0
fifties	1
the	0
sixties	1
and	1
a	0
lot	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
seventies	1
rock	1
and	0
roll	0

yeah	0

earlier	1
things	0

and	1
uh	1
i	0
really	1
enjoy	0
especially	1
the	0
sixties	1
uh	0

okay	1
so	1
wh[at]	1
now	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
opinions	1
on	1
recycling	1

well	1
i	1
definitely	1
think	1
we	1
need	1
to	1
start	1
recycling	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
has	1
got	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
individual	1
responsibility	1
until	1
i	1
think	1
if	1
we	1
wait	1
uh	1
which	1
is	1
happening	1
until	1
somebody	1
says	1
we	0
have	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
it's	0
gonna	1
be	0
too	1
late	1

yeah	1

you	1
know	1
i've	1
heard	1
reports	1
around	1
here	1
that	1
the	1
landfills	1
will	1
be	1
full	1
by	1
the	1
year	1
two	1
thousand	1

yeah	1
i've	1
heard	1
that	1
too	1

and	1
that's	1
not	1
too	1
far	0
away	1
but	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
there	1
it's	1
very	1
difficult	1
here	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
like	1
i	1
do	1
to	1
do	1
much	1
i	1
take	1
my	1
pap[er]	1
i	1
can	1
take	1
plastic	1
and	0
paper	1
bags	1
back	1
to	0
the	1
grocery	1
store	1
and	0

um-hum	1

and	0
i	1
can	1
take	1
plastic	1
like	1
milk	1
cartons	1
or	1
if	0
they	1
have	1
water	1
in	1
them_1	0
and	1
there's	0
some	1
fire	1
stations	1
i	1
can	1
take	1
newspapers	1
to	0
and	0
that	0
is	0
very	1
inconvenient	1
cause	0
i	0
have	1
to	1
wait	1
[un]til	0
i	1
have	1
enough	1
of	0
them	1
to	0
make	0
the	0
trip	1
worthwhile	1

well	1
see	1
i	1
had	1
started	1
saving	1
newspapers	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
save	1
a	0
ton	1
of	1
them_1	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	1
th[at's]	1
i	1
can't	1
remember	1
where	0
i	1
went	1
to	1
take	1
them_1	1
but	1
they	1
wou[ldn't]	1
they	0
wouldn't	1
take	1
them_1	1

yeah	1
it's	0
very	1
hard	1
to	1
find	1
a	0
spot	1
and	0
then	1
i	1
don't	0
know	1
if	0
you	0
notice	1
even	1
doing	1
that	1
the	0
amount	1
of	0
trash	1
we	0
throw	1
away	1
is	0
incredible	1
bottles	1
that	1

oh	0
i	1
know	1

glass	1
that	0
cannot	1
be	1
it	0
could	1
be	0
recycled	1
but	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
place	1
to	0

there's	1
no	1
really	1
recycling	1
facilities	1

no	1
we	0
have	1
a	0
pilot	1
program	1
in	0
Arlington	1
going	1
on	1
i	0
think	1
in	0
the	0
north	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
city	1
where	1
they're	0
having	1
people	1
separate	1
the	0
garbage	1
as	0
the	0
trash	1
as	0
they	0
put	1
it	0
out	1

i	1
think	1
that's	1
a	1
good	1
idea	1

and	0
i	1
think	0
that's	1
what	0
it	0
is	0
gonna	1
have	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
where	0
we're	0
just	0
forced	1
to	0

besides	1
well	1
like	1
a	1
law	1
or	1
whatever	1
and	1
that's	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
New	0
York	1
or	1
isn't	1
it	1

yeah	1

i	1
think	1
so	1
it's	1
just	0
because	1
they	1
have	1
to	0
you	1
know	0

um-hum	1

you	1
get	1
ticketed	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
do	1
it	0
right	1

right	1
uh-huh	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
it's	1
going	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
that	1
because	0
some	1
people	1
will	0
just	1
not	1
go	1
to	0
the	0
it's	0
a	1
it's	0
trouble	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
do	1
what	0
i	0
do	1
i	0

yeah	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
am	0
willing	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
but	1

plus	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
have	1
a	0
place	1
to	0
store	1
all	1
of	0
it	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
see	0
i	1
live	1
in	1
an	1
apartment	1

yeah	1
it's	1
very	1
difficult	1
like	0
our	0
garage	1
is	0
always	1
full	0
of	0
stacks	1
of	0
newspapers	1
and	0
so	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
i	1
think	1
there	0
needs	1
to	0
be	1
more	1
places	1
i	0
also	1
have	1
a	0
real	1
strong	1
opinion	1
in	1
Iowa	1
the	1
state	1
i'm	1
from	1
uh	1
i	1
believe	1
it's	0
gone	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
dollar	1
now	1
everytime	1

um-hum	1

everytime	1
you	1
buy	1
a	1
container	1
no	0
matter	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
whether	1
it	1
is	0
glass	1
whether	0
it's	0
a	0
beer	1
can	1
or	0
a	0
fifth	1
of	1
whiskey	1
or	0

pop	1
or	0
whatever	1

back	1
to	1
the	0
store	1
and	0
you	0
get	1
it	1
back	1

uh	1
so	1
that	1
way	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
forces	1
you	1
to	0
recycle	1

you're	0
forced	1
to	1
and	1
uh	0
you	0
also	1
don't	1
see	0
the	0
litter	1
there	0
people	1
just	1

yeah	1
that's	1
true	0

it	0
makes	1
it	0
worthwhile	1
to	0
take	1
it	0
back	1
and	0
i've	0
just	0
started	1
drinking	1
a	0
new	1
water	1

the	0
states	1
that	0

that	0
take	1
them_1	0
back	1

yeah	1
well	1
wh[at]	1
some	0
of	1
them	0
are	0
five	1
some	1
are	0
ten	1
cents	1
i	0
am	0
looking	1
at	0
it	1
right	0
now	1

is	0
Texas	1
one	1
of	0
them_1	0

Texas	1
is	1
not	1

of	1
them	1
see	1
so	1
i	0
have	1
to	1
throw	1
them_1	0
away	1
cause	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
to	1
take	0
glass	1

yeah	1
no	1
i	0
don't	1
think	1
that	0
there's	1
enough	1
being	0
done	1
now	1
i	0
work	1
at	0
JC	1
Penney	1
at	0
their	0
corporate	1
headquarters	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
we	1
have	1
a	1
paper	1
recycling	1
program	1
that's	0
um	1
company	1
wide	1
and	0
i	0
do	1
the	0
recycling	1
for	0
that	1

do	1
they	1
save	1
like	0
the	0
paper	1
the[y]	1
they	0
use	1
like	1
the	1
office	1
paper	1

yeah	1

good	1
because_1	0
there	1
is	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
waste	1
there	0
isn't	1
there	0

yeah	1
i	0
know	0
there's	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
computer	1
paper	1
though	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
use	1

right	1

right	1

but	0
um	0
we	1
use	0
to	0
have	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	1
i	1
i	0
don't	0
even	1
remember	0
how	1
much	0
money	1
that	0
they've	1
um	1
m[ean]	1
i	1
mean	1
the	1
money	1
that	0
they've	0
made	1
from	0
the	0
recycling	1
program	1
they've	0
donated	1
it	0
to	1
charities	1

right	1

i	1
mean	1
they've	1
made	1
a	1
substantial	1
amount	1
of	0
money	1
from	0
it	0

yeah	1

something	1
else	1
i	0
think	1
we	1
can	0
do	1
is	1
support	1
companies	1
that	0
encourage	1
like	1
i've	1
decided	1
Downy	1
fabric	1
softener	1
now	0
has	1
where	1
you	0
can	1
buy	1
a	0
little	1
carton	1

yeah	1

you	0
add	0
water	1
i'll	1
i	0
image	1
everybody	1
else	1
will	1
start	0
doing	1
that	0
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
but	0
i	1
am	0
going	0
to	0
stick	1
with	0
Downy	1
because	0
they	1
were	0
first	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
i	0
want	0
them	1
to	1
have	1
my	0
business	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
packaging	1
could	0
be	0
done	1
much	0
better	1
there	0
is	0
so	0
much	1
plastic	1
that	1

well	0
now	1
you	0
see	1
some	1
of	0
this	0
stuff	1
and	1
you're	1
and	1
then	1
when	0
they	1
come	1
out	0
with	1
the	0
new	1
things	1
you	1
are	1
like	1
uh	1
well	0
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
that	0
before	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
just	0
people	0
have	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
aware	1
unfortunately	1
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	1
that	0
just	0
don't	1
care	1
and	0
they	0
don't	1
wanna	0
think	1
about	1
it	0

yeah	1
that's	1
true	1

and	1
uh	0
i	1
just	0
look	1
at	0
it	0
as	0
i	0
don't	0
want	0
my	1
grandchildren	1
looking	1
at	0
me	0
and	0
saying	1
why	1
didn't	0
you	0
do	1
something	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
want	0
to	0
feel	1
like	0
i	0
at	0
least	1
tried	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
it	0
just	0
may	1
overwhelm	1
us	0
here	1
when	0
we	0
run	1
out	0
of	0
places	1
to	0
put	1
it	0
then	1
we'll	0
be	0
forced	1
to	0
it	0
may	1
be	0
too	0
late	1

do	0
they	1
not	1
ever	1
i	0
mean	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
that	0
much	1
do	1
they	1
not	1
ever	1
burn	1
trash	1
or	0
anything	1
like	1

very	1
little	1
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
and	0
if	0
you've	0
ever	1
know	1
like	0

then	1
that's	1
pollution	1

i	1
know	0
Amway	1
i	0
only	0
use	1
a	0
couple	1
things	0
form	0
Amway	1
that	0
it	1
says	1
this	1
is	1
burnable	1
material	1
well	1
that	0
doesn't	1
do	1
me	0
any	0
good	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
any	0
place	1
to	0
burn	1
it	0

yeah	1
i	0
know	1
i	1
guess	1
you	0
run	1
into	1
the	0
pollution	1
factor	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	1
just	1
like	0
the	0
glass	1
bottles	1
th[at]	0
that	0
says	1
on	0
the	0
bottle	1
i	0
can	0
get	0
ten	1
cents	1
but	0
not	1
in	0
Texas	1

yeah	1

and	0
there's	0
no	1
place	1
i	0
can	0
take	1
glass	1
to	0

so	1
i	0
still	1
throw	0
away	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
glass	1

truly	0
sad	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	1
the	0
packaging	1
really	1
grips	1
me	0
you	0
buy	1
something	1
it's	0
got	0
a	0
great	1
big	0
piece	1
of	0
cardboard	1
and	0
a	0
great	1
big	0
piece	1
of	0
plas[tic]	1

okay	1

so	1
are	1
you	1
a	1
freshwater	1
or	1

mostly	1
freshwater	1
uh	1

freshwater	1

yeah	1
i	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
fish	1
uh	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
real	1
young	1
down	1
in	1
Galveston	1
with	1
my	1
parents	1
and	1
i	1
never	1
really	1
got	1
into	1
that	1
too	1
much	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
really	1
to	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
and	1
i	1
didn't	1
know	0
anybody	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
boat	1
now	1
so	1
i	1
don't	1
fish	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
saltwater	1

um-hum	1
most	1
of	0
my	0
fishing	1
has	0
been	1
in	0
the	1
saltwater	1
huh	1
mostly	1
deep	1
sea	1
fishing	1
for	1
grouper	1
and	0
bottom	1

neat	1

and	1
uh	0
huh	0
i	1
have	0
caught	1
one	0
or	0
two	1
small	1
sharks	1

oh	1
really	1

and	1
uh	0
yes	1

what'd	0
you	1
do	1
with	1
them	1

put	1
them	0
[laughter-back]	1

you	1
didn't	1
get	1
a	1
big	1
kick	1
out	1
of	1
killing	1
them	0
like	1
some	1
people	1
do	1

no	1
no	0

i	1
love	1
shark	1
steak	1
but	1
uh	0
the	1
ones	1
i	0
caught	1

never	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
uh	0
really	1
do	1
anything	1
uh	1

do	0
they	1
have	1
a	1
limit	1
on	1
sharks	1
i	1
mean	0
is	0
that	1
like	0
a	1
a	1
sport	0
fish	1
can	0
you	1
actually	1
catch	1
those	1
and	1
there's	1
no	0
limit	1

is	0
there	1
a	0
limit	1
i	0
have	0
no	1
idea	1
i	0
know	1
i	1
my	0
home	1
is	0
in	0
uh	1
Pensacola	1
Florida	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
it's	1
they	0
do	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
shark	0
fishing	1
in	0
that	1
you	1
know	1
in	0
the	0
gulf	1

right	1

and	1
um	1
a	1
certain	1
period	0
of	1
time	1
during	1
the	1
year	1
they	0
have	1
all	0
along	1

have	1
uh	0
shark	1
tournaments	1
and	1
you	1

and	1
actually	1
pick	1
them	0
off	0
the	1
[laughter-bottom]	1

right	1

hand	1
picked	1

[laughter-that's]	1
[laughter-right]	1

the	0
weirdest	1
fishing	1
experience	1
i	0
ever	1
had	1
and	0
uh	0
people	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
are	0
still	1
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
if	0
i	0
really	1
caught	1
what	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
caught	1
we	1
were	0
in	1
uh	0
Rockport	1
which	0
is	0
close	1
to	0
Corpus	1

um-hum	0

and	0
we	0
had	0
been	1
fishing	1
in	0
a	0
canal	1
they	0
had	0
all	1
these	0
canals	1
up	0
through	0
this	1
one	0
little	0
retirement	1
area	0
and	1
uh	0
we'd	1
been	0
fishing	1
in	0
the	0
canals	1
and	0
all	1
we	0
were	0
catching	0
were	0
catfish	1
and	0
we	0
were	0
pretty	0
bored	1
with	0
that	1
so	0
we	0
thought	1
well	0
maybe	1
there	0
are	0
some	0
crab	1
in	0
here	1
we'll	0
try	1
to	0
catch	0
some	0
crab	1
so	0
i	1
got	0
my	0
chicken	1
neck	1
and	0
all	0
my	0
little	1
net	1
and	0
everything	1
and	0
something	1
i	0
had	0
a	1
rock	1
to	0
weight	1
it	0
down	1
something	0
grabs	1
and	0
just	0
runs	1
with	0
it	0
and	0
of	0
course	1
there's	0
no	0
hook	1
so	1
it	0
can't	1
be	0
a	0
fish	1

um-hum	0

i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
it's	0
not	0
a	0
fish	1
right	1
and	1
crab	1
they	0
don't	1
bite	1
like	0
that	1
they	1
don't	0
just	0
run	1
with	0
your	0
food	1
so	1
i	0
netted	1
it	0
and	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
ugliest	1
fish	0
i've	0
ever	1
seen	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
It	0
had	0
real	1
teeth	1
like	0
human	1
teeth	1
and	0
it	1
looked	1
archaic	1
i	1
i	0
had	0
no	1
idea	0
what	0
it	0
was	1
i	0
called	1
my	0
father	1
long	1
distance	1
just	0
to	0
describe	1
the	0
thing	1
and	0
it	0
had	1
the	0
rock	1
in	0
it's	1
mouth	1
it	1
not	1
the	0
chicken	1
but	0
the	0
rock	1
itself	1
is	0
what	1
it	0
had	0
grabbed	1

hm	1

they	0
say	1
it's	0
a	0
dogfish	1
from	0
everything	1
i've	0
described	1
it	0
was	0
brown	1
with	0
these	0
little	0
white	1
dots	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
it	0
made	0
a	0
loud	1
kind	0
of	0
almost	1
a	0
croaking	1
noise	0
like	0
a	0
croaker	1
does	1

uh-huh	0

it	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
strangest	1
thing	1
it	1
oh	1
i'll	0
never	1
get	0
over	1
that	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	0
get	0
in	0
the	0
water	1
anywhere	1
around	0
salt	1
water	0
because	0
i'm	0
sure	1
one	0
of	0
those	0
fish	1
are	0
there	1

well	1
we	1
used	0
to	1
i	1
guess	1
the	0
weirdest	1
thing	0
i've	1
ever	0
caught	1
is	1
uh	0
in	1
some	1
of	0
the	1
inlets	1
and	0
the	0
rivers	1
around	1
Rehoboth	1
Delaware	1

um-hum	1

they	1
have	0
a	0
fish	1
that's	0
called	1
an	0
oyster	1
cracker	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	0
you've	0
ever	0
heard	1
of	0
it	0

i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0
that	0
one	1

and	1
it	0
has	1
a	0
huge	1
strong	1
mouth	1
and	0
they	0
actually	1
uh	0
use	1
their	0
teeth	1
to	0
open	1
oysters	1

that's	0
where	1
it	0
gets	0
its	0
name	1
obviously	1
huh	1

um-hum	0
and	0
this	1
is	0
the	0
ugliest	1
fish	1
i	0
have	1
ever	1
seen	0
and	1

and	1
i	0
me[an]	0
and	0
they	1
come	1
in	0
all	0
si[ze]	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
i've	1
caught	0
them	1
from	1
you	1
know	0
three	1
or	0
four	0
inches	1
long	1
up	1
to	0
uh	0

um-hum	0

i	1
guess	0
the	1
la[rgest]	0
largest	1
one	0
i	0
ever	0
caught	1
was	0
probably	0
eight	1
or	0
ten	1
inches	0
long	0
but	0
just	1
huge	1
ugly	1
things	1
just	0
terrible	1

huh	1

can	0
you	0
eat	1
them	0

no	1
no	1

ooh	1
i	1
i	0
don't	1
think	0
i'd	0
want	1
to	0
even	1
if	0
you	0
could	1
if	0
they're	0
that	0
ugly	1
but	1

they	1
just	0
they	0
just	1
look	1
as	0
though	0
you	0
do	0
not	1
want	0
to	0
do	0
anything	0
with	1
them	0

that's	0
like	1
this	0
dogfish	1
it	0
was	1
it	1
scared	0
me	0
to	1
death	1

um-hum	0

it	0
was	0
u[gly]	1
it	0
really	1
it	0
didn't	1
look	0
like	1
it	0
looked	1
like	0
it	0
was	0
something	1
out	0
of	0
the	0
dark	1
ages	0
that	0
just	0
never	0
died	1

well	0
the	0
first	1
time	0
i	0
went	1
uh	0
surf	1
fishing	0
was	0
in	1
and	0
i	0
threw	1
my	0
line	0
out	1
and	1
the	0
first	1
thing	0
i	0
caught	1
was	0
a	0
sand	1
shark	0
which	0
was	0
probably	1
a	0
foot	1
and	0
a	0
half	1
or	1
uh	0
two	1
feet	0
long	1

and	0
scared	1
me	0
to	0
death	1

oh	0

i	0
i	1
had	0
never	1
seen	1
anything	0
and	0
then	1
i	1
was	0
fi[shed]	1
fished	1
for	0
another	0
half	1
hour	0
or	0
forty	0
five	0
minutes	0
caught	1
a	0
few	0
white	1
fish	1
and	0
so	1
forth	0
and	0
then	0
i	1
felt	0
something	1
relatively	0
heavy	1
and	0
i	1
thought	0
oh	1
really	1
here	1
i'm	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
get	1
one	0

and	1
i	0
pulled	1

budgeting	1
activity	1
in	1
our	1
household	1
i	1
has	1
is	1
uh	1
uh	1
kind	1
of	1
an	1
informal	1
kind	1
of	1
situation	1
we	1
we	1
you	1
know	1
put	1
actually	1
what	1
happens	1
is	1
uh	1
is	1
my	1
check	1
gets	1
automatically	1
deposited	1
i	1
don't	1
even	1
have	1
the	1
glories	1
of	1
bringing	1
home	1
my	1
check	1
anymore	1
it	1
just	1
gets	1
deposited	1
and	1
and	1
and	1
and	1
and	1
and	1
my	1
my	1
wife	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
know	1
looks	1
at	1
all	1
those	1
bills	1
that	1

counting	1
on	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
my	0

them	0
you	0

our	1
our	0
budgeting	1
w[e]	0
we	0
really	1
don't	0
have	0
a	1
formal	1
budgeting	1
situation	1
every	1
time	1
i've	0
ever	1
tried	1
one	0
it's	0
uh	0
i've	1
just	1
got	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
minutia	1
and	0
uh	1
i've	1
just	1
decided	1
not	0
to	1
pursue	1
it	1
uh	0
what	0
what's	0
your	1
budget	0
situation	0

well	1
actually	1
uh	1
i've	0
i've	1
had	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
different	1
situations	1
my	1
current	1
one	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
successful	1
uh	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
point	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
my	1
husband	1
my	1
ex-husband	1
was	1
an	1
alcoholic	1
and	1
we	1
got	1
divorced	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
mid	1
seventies	1
and	1
that	1
left	1
me	1
with	1
three	1
teenagers	1

you	0
know	0
well	0
a[ctually]	0
a[ctually]	1
actually	1
that	1
kind	0
of	1
situation	1
is	0
just	0
a	1
wonderful	1
for	0
budgets	1
isn't	1
it	0

it	1
certainly	1
[laughter-is]	1

but	1
at	0
any	1
rate	1
what	1
happened	1
was	1
that	1
i	0
i	1
just	1
absolutely	1
put	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
credit	1
cards	1
i	1
didn't	1
rip	1
them_1	1
up	1
i	1
didn't	1
send	1
them_1	1
back	1
nothing	1
i	1
just	1
put	1
them	0
away	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
handy	1
to	1
have	1
if	1
i	1
absolutely	1
had	1
to	0
have	1
something	0
i	1
could	0
go	0
use	1
it	0

um-hum	1

but	1
uh	1
mostly	1
we	1
just	1
spent	0
cash	1
whatever	1
we	1
had	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
didn't	1
have	1
it	1
we	1
absolutely	1
didn't	1
spend	1
it	0
but	0

kind	1
of	1
the	1
way	0

and	0
so	1
i'm	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
demanding	1
person	1
in	0

that	1
aspect	1
so	0
for	0

i	0
i	1
say	0
it	0
might	0
go	0
for	0
another	1
thirteen	1
but	0

too	1
late	1
we'll	1
never	1
find	0
that	1
out	0

this	0
is	1
so	1
funny	1
that's	1
wonderful	0
but	1
you're	0

me	1
and	1
you	1

difficulty	0
spending	1
money	1
you	1
need	1
somebody	0
to	1

you	1

it	1

not	1
you	1

i	1
i	1
i	1
don't	0

that	0
much	0

i	0
just	0
uh	0
we	0
we	1
just	1
sort	0
of	1
have	1
had	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
too	1
many	1
obligations	1
to	1
you	1
know	1
we	0
sort	1
of	1
take	0
care	1
of	0
the	1
kids	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
school	1
and	1
they	0
they	1
got	1
through	1
school	1
and	1
that	1
was	0
the	0
major	1
you	1
know	1
decade	1
of	1
expenses	1
you	1
know	1
so	0
we	0
we	0
feel	1
as	0
uh	1
but	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
any	1
formal	1
budgeting	1
uh	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
i	0
we	0
just	0
apparently	1
have	0
been	0
very	1
fortunate	0
when	0
we	0
went	0
to	0
wanna	0
go	0
out	1
to	0
eat	0
we	0
go	0
out	0
to	1
eat	1
and	0
we	0
never	0
really	1
you	0
know	0
have	0
to	1
program	1
money	0
for	0
that	0
or	1
make	0
choices	1
you	0
know	1
but	0
uh	0
we	1
don't	1
have	1
that	0
uproarious	1
a	0
a	0
lifestyle	1
after	0
all	1
we're	0
we	0

uh	1
well	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
say	1
your	1
opinion	1
is	0
on	1
gun	1
control	1

well	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
i've	1
i've	1
had	1
mixed	1
emotions	1
i	1
guess	1
when	1
i	1
listen	1
to	1
uh	1
the	1
radio	1
and	1
and	1
watch	1
TV	1
about	1
the	1
different	1
uh	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
happening	1
i	1
uh	1
i'm	1
against	1
it	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
token	1
um	1
i	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
purchased	1
a	1
gun	1
just	1
because	1
i	1
wanted	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
that	1

well	1

so	1
i	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
rifle	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
um	1
the	1
ammunition	1
is	0
probably	1
so	1
old	1
i'm	1
afraid	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
but	1
uh	1
i	0
bought	1
it	1
for	0
target	1
practicing	1
and	1
uh	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
i	1
wanted	1
a	1
weapon	1
uh	1
how	1
do	0
you	1
feel	1
about	1
it	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
uh	1
down	1
here	1
in	1
Texas	1
they	1
don't	1
have	1
a	1
waiting	1
period	1
on	1
handguns	1

hm	0

and	1
i	1
think	1
they	0
need	1
that	1
uh	1
now	1
i	1
do	1
have	1
a	1
i	0
have	1
a	1
pistol	1
it's	1
a	1
little	1
twenty	1
two	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
a	0
twenty	1
two	1
or	1
a	1
twelve	1
gauge	1
shotgun	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
do	1
like	1
to	0
have	1
my	1
guns	1

uh	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
if	0
i'll	0
ever	1
use	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
and	1
like	0
you	1
my	1
bullets	1
to	1
my	0
little	0
pistol's	1
probably	1
uh	1
about	1
three	1
years	0
old	1
uh	1
my	1
gun	1
hasn't	1
been	1
shot	1
in	0
a	1
year	1
or	0
two	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
like	0
to	0
have	1
them_1	0
where	1
handy	0

well	1
up	1
uh	1
up	1
in	1
New	0
England	1
where	0
i'm	1
from	0
uh	0
y[ou]	1
you	1
had	1
to	0
get	1
a	1
permit	1
before	1
you	1
could	1
buy	1
any	1
ammu[n]it[ion]	1
amm[unition]	1
ammunition	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
that	0
was	1
really	1
good	1
and	1
i	0
think	1
it	1
they	0
uh	1
takes	1

takes	1
two	1
weeks	1
for	1
that	0
system	1
to	0
process	1
um	1
your	1
request	1
for	1
uh	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
gun	1
permit	1
but	1
uh	1
but	1
to	1
buy	1
ammunition	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
p[ermit]	1
permit	1
from	1
the	1
police	1
station	1
in	1
your	1
local	1
area	0
to	1
do	1
that	1

i've	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
anything	1
like	1
that	1

yeah	1
um	1

that	1
would	1
be	1
nice	1
but	1
a[nd]	1
you	1
know	1

the	1
criminals	0
that	0
are	1
going	1
to	1
get	0
their	1
guns	1
one	1
way	0
or	0
the	1
other	1

i	0
i	1
i	1
agree	0
i	1

i	1
think	1
you	0
know	1
one	1
of	1
the	0
things	1
that	1
that	1
that	1
needs	1
to	0
happen	1
is	0
uh	0
to	1
to	0
stop	1
the	1
impulse	1
buyer	1
from	1
um	1
buying	1
it	0
quickly	1
and	1
and	1
um	1
maybe	0
putting	1
a	1
week's	1
waiting	1
period	0
or	1
something	1
on	1
it	0
but	1

but	1
if	1
someone's	1
really	1
determined	1
to	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
a	1
firearm	1
uh	0
you	0
can	1
pick	1
it	0
up	0
anyplace	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
you	1
can	0
get	1
them	1
really	1
cheap	1

i	1
know	1
i	1
i	1
uh	0
th[e]	0
i	1
had	1
a	1
waiting	1
period	0
on	1
my	1
pistol	1
because_1	1
i	1
was	0
down	1
in	1
uh	1
Tennessee	1
and	1
uh	0
they	1
had	1
a	0
waiting	1
period	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	1
we	0
bought	1
it	1
there	1
and	0

how	0
long	1
was	1
the	1
waiting	0
period	0
out	1
there	0

about_1	1
nine	1
days	1

ah	1
that	0
wasn't	1
too	0
too	1
bad	1

no	0
no	1

because	1
i[f]	0
if	1
you're	0
gonna	1
go	1
buy	1
something	1
um	1
of	1
of	1
that	1
nature	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you're	0
gonna	1
have	1
some	1
idea	1
as	0
to	0
what	1
you're	0
gonna	0
do	1
with	0
it	0
you're	0
not	1
gonna	1
react	1
that	0
quickly	1
in	0
other	1
words	1
you	0
know	0
you	1
[d]on't	1
have	0
a	1
need	1
to	1
go	0
buy	1
a	0
gun	1
to	0
go	0
shoot	1
it	1
the	0
next	1
day	1

yeah	1
somebody	1
want	1
do	1
th[at]	1
i	1
i	1
at	0
times	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
ought	1
to	0
have	1
a	0
waiting	1
period	1
on	0
all	1
firearms	1

yeah	1
i	1
do	0
too	1
uh	0
because	1
[laughter-it]	0
doesn't	1
make	0
any	0
difference	1
uh	0
uh	0
whether	1
it's	0
a	0
pistol	1
or	1
a	1
shotgun	1
i	1
suppose	1
they	0
both	1
do	1
the	0
same	1
kind	0
of	1
job	1

shotgun	1
hurts	1
worse	1
than	0
a	0
pistol	1
does	1

uh	0
yeah	0
i	0
suppose	0
i'd	1
never	0
got	0
shot	1
with	0
either	0
one	1
but	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
um	1
i	1
think	1
you	0
could	0
recover	1
from	0
a	0
pistol	1
but	1
not	0
from	1
a	0
[laughter-shotgun]	1

a	1
shotgun's	1
got	0
too	1
much	1
of	0
a	0
spread	1
or	0
at	0
least	0
ours	0
does	0
uh	0

yeah	0

uh	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
little	1
uh	1
thing	1
on	0
the	0
bo[ttom]	0
bottom	1
of	1
th[e]	0
on	0
top	1
of	0
the	0
barrel	1
where	1
you	1
a[s]	0
you	0
turn	1
it	1

uh-huh	1

you	0
can	1
make	0
it	0
either	1
tight	0
or	0
[laughter-as]	1
loose	0
as	1
loose	0
can	1
get	0

oh	1

and	0
the	1
spread	1
changes	1

uh	0
i've	1
got	0
a	0
a	1
manual	1
singled	1
shot	1
and	0
i	0
guess	1
it	0
doesn't	1
have	0
any	1
any	1
automatic	1
features	1
to	0
it	0
the	1
further	1
away	1
i	0
get	1
the	1
the	1
uh	0
wider	1
the	0
shot	1
gets	0
from	0
the	1
target	1

yeah	1

and	0
the	0
closer	1
that	1
i	1
get	0
the	1
tighter	0
that	1
it	0
gets	1
it's	1
got	1
a	0
hell	1
of	1
a	1
kick	1
to	1
it	0

yeah	0
my	1
husband	1
had	1
a	0
uh	0
a	1
police	1
gun	1
at	0
one	0
time	1
and	1
i	0
shot	1
that	1
thing	0
one	0
time	1
almost	0
knocked	0
me	1
down	1

it	0
was	1
just	1
a	1
little	0
i	0
don['t]	1
i	0
forget	0
i	0
think	1
it	1
was	0
a	1
three	1
fifty	1
seven	1
i'm	1
not	1
sure	0

do	0
you	0
belong	1
to	1
a	0
gun	1
club	1
or	0
you	0
uh	0

he	1
belonged	1
to	0
one	1
awhile	0
back	1
uh	1
since	1
we	0
mo[ved]	1
we've	1
only	1
been	1
here	1
in	0
Texas	1
for	1
about	0
a	1
year	1

um-hum	0

uh	0
we	1
can't	1
even	0
find	1
a	1
place	0
to	1
shoot	1
just	1
for	1
target	1
practice	1

no	0
kidding	0

i'd	0
love	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
shotgun	1
we	1
traded	1
his	1
pistol	1
for	1
that	1
shotgun	1

huh	0
well	1
the	0
the	1
um	1
uh	1
clubs	1
that	1
we've	1
got	1
around	1
here	1
are	0
kind	1
of	1
expensive	1
but	1
uh	0
it's	0
well	1
worth	0
it	1
you	0
can	0
go	1
down	1
and	0
shoot	1
up	0
against	0
a	0
sand	1
bag	1
and	0
so[me]	0
targets	1
and	0
have	1
uh	0
competition	1
um	0
i've	1
never	1
really	0
joined	1
a	1
club	1
because	0
i	1
haven't	1
got	1
the	0
time	1
not	1
because	0
i	0
haven't	0
got	0
the	0
desire	1
uh	0
there's	0
an	1
annual	1
membership	1
fee	1
uh	1
that's	0
that's	1
fairly	1
high	1
plus	1
there's	0
initi[ation]	1
initiation	1
fee	0
that	1
you	1
have	1
to	0
pay	1
as	0
a	0
first	1
time	1
uh	0
uh	0
member	1

so	0
the	0
whole	1
process	1
can	0
cost	1
you	0
a	0
hundred	1
fifty	0
dollars	1
just	0
to	0
join	0
the	0
club	1
plus	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
ammunition	1
in	0
any	0
tournaments	1
that	0
you	0
would	1
join	1
in	0

yeah	1
well	1
that's	0
what	1
uh	1
my	0
husband	1
wh[en]	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	0
it	1
gun	1
club	0
when	1
they's	0
done	1
that	1
it	0
you	1
know	0
he	1
went	0
mostly	1
just	0
to	0
um	1
shoot	1
at	0
paper	1
targets	1

uh-huh	0

uh	0
but	0
you	1
know	1
they	1
used	0
speed	1
and	1
accuracy	1
and	1
all	1
that	1

i	1
think	1
the	1
the	1
gun	1
clubs	1
serve	1
a	1
useful	1
purpose	1
in	0
fact	1
i'd	1
like	0
to	0
see	0
somehow	1
they	0
tie	1
the	1
legislation	1
into	0
not	0
only	1
when	0
you	0
buy	1
a	0
weapon	0
you	0
have	1
to	1
uh	0
show	1
that	0
you've	0
gone	0
to	0
school	1
or	0
gone	0
to	0
some	0
class	1
to	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
handle	1
that	0
weapon	0

that's	1
a	0
good	0
i've	1
never	0
thought	1
of	0
that	1

that's	1
a	0
good	1
point	1

and	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
it	1
even	1
a[fter]	0
after	1
you	0
wait	1
your	0
nine	0
days	1
if	0
you	0
don't	1
know	0
how	0
to	0
hand[le]	1
it's	0
just	1
like	0
putting	1
someone	0
in	0
an	0
automobile	1
that	0
doesn't	1
know	0
how	0
to	0
drive	1
and	0
you	0
give	1
him	0
a	0
license	1
because	1
he	0
waited	1
nine	1
days	0

yeah	0
that	0
and	1
yeah	0

he	1
could	0
he	1
could	0
not	0
only	1
um	1
uh	0
shoot	1
himself	1
he	0
could	0
he	0
could	1
uh	0
mishandle	1
a	0
weapon	0
leave	1
it	0
at	0
home	1
and	1
let	0
a	0
child	1
get	0
at	1
it	0

and	0
well	1
we	1
uh	1
we	1
was	1
living	1
on	0
a	1
Navy	1
base	1
down	0
in	0
Memphis	1
and	0
uh	1
this	0
one	1
guy	0
decided	1
to	0
play	1
uh	0
lonesome	1
cowboy	1
or	0
something	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
twirling	1
his	0
gun	1
around	0
and	1
shot	1
himself	0
in	0
his	1
foot	1

wow	0
he	0
was	1
fortunate	0
he	0
[laughter-could]	1
[laughter-he]	1
[laughter-could]	0
[laughter-of]	1
[laughter-hit]	1
[laughter-something]	0
[laughter-else]	1

well	0
he	1
went	0
tumbling	1
down	0
the	1
steps	1
along	1
with	0
uh	0
shooting	1
his	1
foot	1
almost	0
off	1
he	0
broke	1
his	1
leg	1
and	0
a	0
collar	1
bone	1
and	0
couple	1
of	0
other	1
things	1
i'm	0
sure	1
being	1
mister	1
cowboy	1
i	1

wow	0

i	1
can't	1
remember	0
what	1
the	0
na[me]	0
term	1
was	0
going	1
around	0
it	0
was	0
about	0
four	1
to	0
five	1
years	0
ago	0

but	0
naw	1
th[e]	0
i	1
guess	0
that	1
would	0
be	0
a	0
good	1
idea	1

about_1	0
uh	0
private	1
citizens	1
selling	1
uh	0
weapons	1
like	0
if	0
you	0
wanted	1
to	0
sell	1
your	0
pistol	1
to	0
me	1
huh	0
how	0
do	0
you	1
feel	0
about	0
that	1
do	0
you	0
believe	1
there	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
legislation	1
guiding	1
the	0
um	0
buyer	1
and	0
the	0
seller	1
and	0
or	0
do	0
you	1
believe	1
that	0
you	0
ought	1
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
sell	1
your	0
system	1
uh	0
because	0
you	0
own	1
it	0

uh	1
that's	1
a	0
hard	1
one	0
because_1	1
we	1
did	1
that	0
but	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
there	1
ought	0
to	0
be	0
some	1
rule	0
against	1
it	0
i'll	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
person	1
who	0
sells	1
the	0
gun	1
ought	1
to	0
protect	1
themself	1
because	1
if	0
that	1
gun's	1
registered	1
to	0
them	1
and	0
somebody	1
else	1
uses	0
that	0
gun	0
in	0
something	1
the	0
cops	1
are	0
gonna	1
come	0
to	1
you	1

yeah	0
but	0
is[n't]	0
isn't	1
there	0
a	0

after	0
you	0
register	1
a	0
gun	0

ah	0

i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	0
i've	1
only	0
had	1
one	1
gun	0
and	0

because	0
i	1
have	0

and	0
i've	0
kept	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
the	0
one	1
gun	0
that	0
was	0
in	0
my	1
name	1

the	0
um	1
the	0
rifle	1
that	0
i've	1
got	0
is	0
not	1

and	0
um	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
why	1
i	0
never	1
registered	0
it	0
but	0
the	0
uh	0

i	1
don't	0
think	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
register	1
a	0
shotgun	1

um	0
i'd	0
i'd	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
it's	0
voluntary	0
the	0
um	0
the	0

well	0
see	1
uh	0
my	1
husband	1
has	0
a	0
thing	1
if	0
they	1
go	1
to	0
uh	0
regulating	1
uh	0
all	1
right	0
uh	0
banning	1
guns	1
o[f]	0
pri[vate]	0
private	1
pri[vate]	1
private	1
ci[tizens]	0
citizens	1

yeah	0

this	0
my	1
kid	1
is	0
jumping	1
on	0
me	0
i	0
can't	1
hardly	0

my	0
husband	1
feels	1
that	0
they'll	0
come	1
and	0
collect	1
everybody's	0
guns	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
that	0
could	0
happen	0
it's	0
just	0
like	1
the	0
uh	0
the	0
social	1
security	1
system	1
once	1
they	1
uh	1
they	0
gave	1
everybody	0
a	0
number	1
and	0
now	1
they're	1
making	1
you	1
um	0
uh	0
get	1
one	0
at	0
at	0
birth	1

and	0
once	1
they	0
have	1
your	0
number	1
they	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
your	1
identification	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
if	0
you	1
try	1
to	1
to	0
do	0
anything	1
um	0
like	1

banning	1
banning	1
them_1	1

wanted	1
to	0
just	0
you	0
know	0
put	0
up	0
the	0
money	0

yeah	0
w[ell]	0

yes	0
well	0
you	1
can	0
look	0
in	0
the	1
uh	0
the	0
we	1
got	1
the	0
thing	1
down	1
here	0
called	0
a	0
shopper	1

uh-huh	0

it's	0
a	0
a	0
who	1
a	0
it's	0
a	0
it's	0
a	0
bargain	1
thing	1
uh	0
you	0
go	1
and	0
everyb[ody]	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
always	1
see	0
guns	1
in	0
there	0
five	0
to	0
seven	0
guns	0
a	0
day	0

yeah	0

it	0
comes	1
out	0
every	0
Tuesday	1

and	0
there's	1
there's	0
no	0
waiting	1
period	1
on	0
that	1

naw	0
[laughter-none]	0
whatsoever	0

you	0
ca[n]	0
call	0
w[e]	0
we	1
sold	0
a	0
refrigerator	1
through	1
it	0
and	1
it	0
took	1
us	0
all	1
of	0
twelve	1
hours	0

you	0
sell	0
the	0
refrigerator	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
and	0
i'm	0
sure	1
it'd	0
be	0
even	1
less	0
for	0
somebody	1
with	0
a	0
good	1
gun	1

hm	0
yeah	0
i	0
think	1
the	0
federal	1
government	1
is	0
um	0
is	0
really	1
far	1
away	1
from	0
uh	0
um	0
control	1
i	1
i	0
don't	1
believe	1
in	0
um	0
should	0
i	0
shouldn't	1
probably	1
say	0
control	1
i	0
mean	0
regulation	0
control	1
is	0
something	0
that	0
i	0
wouldn't	1
want	0
the	0
federal	1
government	1
to	0
have	1
b[ut]	0
um	0
but	0
i	0
would	1
like	0
to	0
see	1
them	0
have	1
a	0
monitoring	1
capability	1
so	1
that	0
they	0
know	1
who	1
has	1
what	0
weapons	1

yeah	0
well	0
i'll	0
agree	1
with	0
you	0
there	1
they	0
do	1
have	0
too	1
much	0
control	1
over	0
us	0
already	1

yeah	0

uh	0
we	1
could	0
look	0
at	0
our	0
paychecks	1
and	0
see	1
how	0
much	0
control	1
they	0
have	1

unfortunately	1
we	1
uh	0
we	0
vote	1
for	0
the	0
the	0
people	1
who	0
spend	1
the	0
money	1
so	0
i	0
can't	1
complain	1
too	1
much	0

yeah	0
i	0
guess	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
they're	0

so	1
well	1
you['re]	1
you['re]	1
you're	1
you	1
you	1
take	1
this	1
subject	1
much	1
more	1
personally	1
than	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
suppose	1

i	1
suppose	1
i	1
do	1
because	1
i've	1
seen	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
those	1
changes	1
the	1
the	1
changes	1
that	1
women	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
genera[tion]	1
well	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
last	1
generation	1
the	1
last	1
fifteen	1
years	1
twenty	1
years	1
going	1
from	1

uh-huh	1

well	1
take	1
it	1
back	1
thirty	1
years	1
i'm	1
going	1
back	1
too	1
far	1
from	1
my	1
parents'	1
generation	1
when	1
mom	1
stayed	1
home	1
period	1
an[d]	1

yeah	1

and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
job	1
or	1
any	1
hope	1
of	1
a	0
job	1
until	1
well	1
unless	1
if	1
you	1
were	0
educated	1
you	1
got	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
might	1
teach	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
before	1
you	0
got	1
married	1

yeah	1

and	1
if	1
you	1
really	1
pushed	1
it	1
you	1
taught	1
until	1
you	1
had	1
kids	1
or	0
something	1
you	0
know	1
if	1

yeah	1

if	1
you	1
had	1
if	0
you	1
were	0
a	1
teacher	1
then	0
you	1
know	0
that	1
was	1
it	1
until	0
the	1
kids	1
you	1
were	0
little	1

yeah	1
you	1
you	1
weren't	1
supposed	0
to	1
want	1
a	1
job	1

yes	1
there	1
was	0
not	1
there's	0
not	1
supposed	0
to	0
be	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
use	1
this	1
education	1
or	1
this	1
brain	1
that	1
you	0
might	1
have	1
for	1
anything	1
other	1
than	0
your	1
house	1
and	0
your	1
children	1
and	0
how	1
clean	1
can	1
the	0
the	0
bathroom	1
floors	0
be	1
on	0
any	0
given	1
day	0

yeah	1

and	0
then	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
course	0
today	1
it's	1
supposed	0
to	1
be	0
all	0
the	1
other	1
way	1
you're	0
supposed	1
to	1
only	1
want	0
the	0
job	1
and	1
and	0
uh	1
your	1
kids	1
should	0
be	0
totally	1
happy	0
in	1
day	1
care	1
because	0
everybody	1
else	1
goes	1
to	0
day	0
care	1

yeah	1

and	0
and	1
we	0
have	1
these	0
wonderful	1
people	0
who	1
are	1
who	1
are	0
totally	1
prepared	1
to	0
tea[ch]	0
to	0
teach	1
your	1
child	1
everything	1
they	1
need	0
to	0
know	0
in	0
day	1
care	0
and	0

um-hum	1

yeah	1
but	0
but	0
but	0
uh	0
a	0
really	1
good	0
day	1
care	0
is	0
probably	0
going	0
to	0
cost	1
more	0
than	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
make	0
at	0
the	0
job	1

and	0
and	1
uh	1
we'll	0
see	1
how	1
the	1
generations	0
go	1
huh	0

yeah	1
i	0
at	1
least	1
for	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	1
depending	1
on	1
on	0
what	0
she	1
did	1
i've	1

yeah	1

i've	1
i	1
was	0
an	1
engineer	1
with	0
uh	1
mechanical	1
engineer	0
with	0
T	0
I	1
and	1
uh	0
i	1
did	0
it	0
for	0
six	1
years	1
and	1
for	0
one	1
well	0
i	0
had	1
one	1
while	0
i	0
was	0
pregnant	1
and	0
then	0
one	1
while	0
my	1
oldest	1
was	0
a	0
year	1
old	1
and	0
and	1
it	0
just	0
drove	1
me	0
crazy	1

did	1
you	1

i	1
could	0
not	0
do	1
either	1
well	1
enou[gh]	0
i	1
couldn't	0
put	0
in	1
enough	1
overtime	1
that	0
was	1
necess[ary]	1
or	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
things	1
that	1
would	0
come	1
up	1
at	1
work	1
that	0
would	1
require	1
me	1
to	0
stay	0
late	1
or	1
to	1
come	0
in	0
early	1
or	0
to	1
do	0
something	0
on	0
Saturdays	1
as	1
is	0
you	1
know	0
as	1
is	1
needed	1
and	1
because	1
my	0
husband	1
had	0
had	0
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
was	1
out	1
of	0
the	0
country	1
also	1
with	0
uh	0
with	0
work	1
for	0
like	0
three	1
months	0
and	0

um-hum	0

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
and	0

so	0
it	0
was	0
you	1
and	0
the	0
kid	1
and	0
your	0
work	1
schedule	1
is	0

yeah	1

well	0
that's	1
the	0
thing	0
see	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	1
if	0
you	0
get	0
along	0
for	0
example	0
if	0
you'd	1
been	0
a	0
technician	1
instead	1
of	1
an	0
engineer	1
you	0
know	0
the	1
technicians	1
work	0
the	1
eight	0
to	1
five	1
job	1
and	1
and	0
know	1
when	1
they're	1
going	1
to	0
be	1
there	0

yeah	1
it	0
might	1
have	1
been	1
better	1

yeah	1

but	1
uh	0
if	1
you're	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
pro[fessional]	1
professional	1
oriented	1
then	1
you've	1
got	1
to	1
have	0
this	1
to	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
perform	1
well	0
on	1
the	0
job	1
you've	0
got	1
to	1
have	0
the	1
flexibility	1
that	1
that	0
doesn't	1
really	0
go	1
with	0
the	0
family	1

yeah	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
in	0
my	1
case	1
i	1
i	0
just	1
uh	0
decided	1
that	1
as	0
long	1
as	1
my	1
kids	1
were	1
little	1
i	1
would	0
be	1
better	0
off	1
at	1
home	1
with	1
them	1
instead	0
of	1
driving	1
myself	1
crazy	1
trying	0
to	1
do	1
everything	1
at	0
once	1

um-hum	0
so	1
you	0
figure	1
one	1
of	0
these	1
days	1

well	1
actually	0
i've	1
found	0
out	0
that	0
i'm	1
not	1
going	0
to	0
go	1
back	1
to	1
being	1
an	0
engineer	1

you're	0
going	1
to	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
being	1
an	0
engineer	1
is	1
that	1
what	0
you	0
think	1

i'm	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
a	0
photographer	1
now	1

oh	1
okay	1
you've	1
found	1
something	0
else	1

i	0
have	1
i	0
have	0
branched	1
out	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
photographer	1
before	1
but	0
when	0
i	1
went	0
to	0
college	1
it	0
was	1
i	0
felt	0
like	0
i	1
couldn't	0
support	0
myself	1
if	0
i	0
decided	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
photographer	1
that	0
it	1
would	0
just	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
hobby	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
i'm	1
i'm	1
very	0
mechanical	1
and	0
mechanical	0
engineering	1
interested	0
me	1
so	0
i	0
did	0
that	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
did	1
that	0
for	0
six	1
years	0
and	1
then	0
i	1
stayed	0
home	1
with	1
my	0
son	1
and	0
did	0
nothing	1
and	0
found	1
out	0
that	0
i	0
was	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
great	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
i	1
was	0
bored	1
part	1
of	0
the	0
time	1
too	1
and	0
i	0
wanted	0
something	1
else	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	0
i	1
mean	0
you	1
figure	1
there's	1
got	1
to	0
be	1
more	0
to	1
life	1
than	1
sitting	1
here	0
playing	1
with	1
this	1
child	1

yeah	0
and	0
it['s]	1
it's	1
great	1
while	1
they're	0
really	0
little	1
but	0
as	1
they	0
get	1
older	1
and	1
they're	1
more	1
independent	1
and	1
there's	1
things	1
to	1
do	1
then	1
it's	1
good	1
for	0
them	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
different	1

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	1
it	1
he	0
goes	1
to	0
a	1
a	0
mother's	1
day	0
out	1
program	1
now	0
once	0
a	1
week	1
both	1
of	0
my	0
kids	1
do	1
and	1
so	0
they're	1
getting	1
they	1
they	1
get	0
the	1
socialization	1
with	0
other	0
kids	1
and	0
y[ou]	0
you	1
know	0
and	0
not	1
really	0
school	1
but	1
but	1
a	0
different	1
authority	0
than	0
mom	1
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
kind	0
of	0
learning	0
how	1
to	0
deal	0
with	0
society	1

and	1
and	0
they	1
they	1
need	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
be	0
able	1
to	1
relate	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
besides	1
the	0
same	1
person	1
every	1
day	1

yeah	1
i	1
think	1
they	0
do	1
too	0

and	0
i	1
need	1
it	0
for	0
the	0
break	1

yeah	1
well	0
that's	1
the	1
other	1
thing	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
talk	0
about	1
women	1
leaving	1
the	1
home	1
and	1
going	0
out	0
to	1
work	1
well	1
still	1
taking	1
care	0
of	1
the	0
children	1
is	1
a	0
very	1
important	1
job	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1
and	1
someone's	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
it	0
and	1
be	0
able	1
to	0
do	0
it	1
right	1
and	1
and	1
if	0
it's	0
not	1
if	1
it's	1
not	0
mom	1
then	1
then	0
dad	1
or	1
somebody's	1
got	0
to	1
move	1
in	0
there	1
and	0
do	1
the	0
job	1
because	1
the	1
kids	1
really	0
need	1
it	0

and	0
enjoy	1
it	0
that's	1
that's	1
the	0
whole	1
thing	0

yeah	1

i	1
think	0
that's	1
the	0
thing	1
that	1
were	0
going	0
to	0
see	1
well	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
biggest	1
thing	0
we're	0
going	0
to	1
see	1
coming	1
up	1
in	0
the	1
next	1
ten	1
year[s]	0
even	1
in	0
the	0
even	1
now	1
they're	0
starting	1
to	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
going	1
to	1
be	0
more	1
in	1
the	0
next	1
ten	1
to	0
fifteen	0
years	1
is	0
that	1
there's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
women	1
and	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
work	1
it	0
out	1
to	0
working	1
part	0
time	1

um-hum	0

because	0
if	0
if	1
i	0
if	0
i	0
had	1
been	0
allowed	0
to	0
work	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	0
thirty	1
hours	0
a	0
week	0
instead	1
of	0
fifty	1
hours	0
a	0
week	1
i	0
might	1
still	0
be	0
working	1
basically	1
full	1
time	1
or	0
part	1
time	0
if	0
there	1
was	0
if	1
there	1
had	0
been	0
some	1
way	0
to	0
work	1
it	0
out	1
because	1

yeah	1

because	1
i	0
liked	1
my	0
job	1
really	0
well	1

um-hum	0

but	0
i	1
was	0
just	0
pulled	1
in	0
so	1
many	0
different	0
directions	1
i	1
was	1
it	0
was	0
just	0
driving	0
me	1
crazy	1
and	0
now	1
with	0
the	0
photography	1
that's	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
working	1
that's	0
what	0
i'm	0
doing	1
is	0
working	0
part	1
time	1
because	0
i	0
can	0
put	1
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
situation	1
for	1
a	0
few	0
hours	1
in	0
the	0
uh	0
week	1
and	0
and	1
use	1
those	0
hours	1
to	0
do	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
thing	1
that	0
i'm	0
doing	0
is	1
taking	1
school	0
pictures	1
in	1
day	1
cares	1
and	0
in	1
mother's	0
day	0
out	1
programs	1
and	0
also	1
soccer	1
teams	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
different	1
stuff	1
like	0
that	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

um-hum	0

so	1
my	0
kids	1
can	0
be	1
in	1
day	1
care	1
for	1
a	0
few	1
hours	1
a	1
week	1
or	0
my	0
husband	1
if	0
it's	0
you	1
know	1
an[d]	0
an[d]	1
when	1
he's	0
at	0
home	1
can	0
take	1
care	1
of	0
them	0

yeah	0
so	0
jobs	1
have	0
to	0
i	0
guess	0
become	1
more	0
flexible	1

i	0
think	1
they're	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
and	0
not	1
and	0
not	0
just	0
for	0
mothers	1
for	0
fathers	1
as	1
well	1

yeah	1

it's	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
both	1

well	0
so	0
so	1
that's	1
another	1
thing	0
that	0
has	0
to	0
adapt	1
is	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
the	1
the	0
father's	1
attitudes	1
about	0
you	0
know	0
who[se]	1
whose	1
job	1
is	1
this	0

yeah	1

well	1
it['s]	0
it's	0
his	1
job	0
too	0
and	0
i	1
to	0
me	1
the	0
only	0
important	1
issue	1
is	0
the	0
children	1
because	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
housework	1
goes	1
you	0
know	1
men	1
can	0
do	0
housework	1
just	0
as	0
easily	1
as	0
women	1
and	0
thanks	1
to	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
new	0
inventions	1
housework	1
doesn't	0
take	0
as	1
much	1
time	1
as	0
it	0
used	1
to	0
so	1
uh	0

it's	0
just	0
convincing	1
your	0
husband	1
that's	1
important	1
or	0
that	1
that	1
that	0
it's	1
important	1
enough	0
for	1
him	0
to	1
do	1
it	0

yeah	1
to	0
yeah	1
to	0
m[e]	0

yeah	1
well	1

because	1
if	0
he	0
saw	1
mom	1
doing	1
only	1
that	1
you	0
know	0
all	1
the	0
time	0
he	1
was	0
growing	0
up	1
then	0
it's	0
hard	1
to	0
think	0
of	0
it	1
in	0
that	0
other	1
you	0
know	0
uh	1
that	0
i	1
should	0
do	1
it	0
or	0
tha[t]	1
or	0
just	0
to	0
think	1
about	1
doing	1
it	0
rather	1
than	0
having	1
someone	1
tell	1
him	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

and	0
you	1
you	0
you	1

yeah	1
you	0
talk	1
yeah	1

yeah	1

i	0
know	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
big	0
thing	1
in	0
our	0
house	1
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
was	0
that	1
if	0
i	0
wanted	1
my	0
husband	0
to	0
do	0
something	1
to	0
help	1
and	0
even	0
though	1
we	0
were	0
both	1
working	0
the	0
same	1
number	0
of	0
hours	1
and	0
and	0
doing	0
things	0
i	1
had	0
to	0
come	0
in	0
there	0
specifically	1
and	0
say	1
this	1
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
this	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

this	0
is	0
what	1
you	0
do	1
it	0
now	1
[laughter-no]	1

and	0
a	0
man	1
might	0
say	1
out	0
loud	1
well	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
understand	1
this	1
and	0
i	0
agree	1
but	0
still	1
he	0
was	0
raised	1
with	0
a	0
mom	1
taking	0
care	1
of	0
him	0
and	0

yes	1
and	1

and	0
and	0
that's	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
attitude	0
to	0
change	1

yeah	0
and	1
without	1
and	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
they	0
don't	0
look	1
at	0
things	1
most	1
men	0
don't	0
walk	1
into	0
the	0
kitchen	1
and	0
see	0
that	0
the	0
dishes	1
are	0
there	1
and	0
that	0
yes	1
you	0
probably	0
ought	0
to	0
unload	1
the	0
dishwasher	1
and	0
load	1
the	0
new	0
ones	0
in	1
and	0
run	1
it	0

um-hum	0

they	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
kind	0
of	0
scoot	1
it	0
on	0
another	0
spot	1
on	1
the	0
on	0
the	0
sink	1
and	1
and	0
put	0
the	0
next	0
plate	1
down	1
and	1
and	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
get	0
around	1
to	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
most	0
women	0
walk	1
in	0
and	0
and	0
and	1
with	0
oh	0
got	0
to	0
clean	1
all	0
this	0
up	1
got	0
to	0
get	1
this	1
out	1
and	0
this	0
in	1
and	0
this	1
you	1
know	0
taken	0
care	1
of	0
instead	1
of	0
having	0
someone	0
say	1
now	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
do[ne]	1
this	1
is	0
the	0
time	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
but	0

hm	0
uh	0
um-hum	1
yeah	1

and	0

but	0

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
that	1
is	0
is	1
how	1
it	0
was	0
drilled	1
into	0
you	0
when	0
you	0
were	0
a	0
kid	1
which	0
brings	0
us	0
back	1
to	0
the	0
idea	1
you	0
know	0
someone's	1
got	1
to	0
be	0
there	0
taking	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
kids	1
to	0
drill	1
in	0
these	1
you	0
know	0
drill	1
in	0
the	0
right	1
ideas	0
to	0
so	0
that	0
they	0
know	1
that	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
male	1
and	0
female	1
are	0
both	0
responsible	0
for	0
doing	1
this	0
and	0

that's	0
right	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

and	0
and	1
uh	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	1
going	0
to	0
show	1
up	0
a	0
lot	1
more	1
now	0
in	0
the	1
in	1
the	0
next	0
generation	0
of	1
of	0
boys	1
and	0
girls	1
it's	0
not	1
they're	1
not	0
going	1
to	0
the	0
boys	1
in	0
this	0
next	1
generation	0
are	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
be	0
told	1
as	0
much	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
because	0
mom	1
was	0
there	1
saying	0
that	0
dad	1
is	0
there	1
you	0
know	0
you	0

uh-huh	0


you	0
both	1
got	1
to	0
they	1
were	0
both	1
working	0
at	0
whatever	0
things	1
were	0
needed	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
they're	1

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

they're	1
going	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
the	0
kids	1
you	1
need	0
do	0
this	1
because	1
it	0
needs	1
to	0
be	0
done	1
not	0
because	1
it's	0
a	0
woman's	1
job	1
or	0
a	0
man's	1
job	0
but	0
because	1
it's	0
dirty	1
and	0
it	0
needs	1
to	0
be	0
cleaned	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
in	0
between	1
we	0
got	1
a	0
a	0
group	1
of	0
kids	0
a	0
generation	1
of	0
kids	0
who	1
didn't	1
learn	0
to	0
take	0
responsibility	1
because	1
mom	1
left	0
to	0
go	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
and	0
dad	1
didn't	0
move	1
in	0
to	0
fill	0
the	0
gap	1
and	0
so	0
basically	1
no	1
one	0
was	0
taking	0
the	0
responsibility	1

and	0
it's	0
gonna	1
it's	0
gonna	1
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
happened	1
in	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
cases	1

yeah	1
some	0
kids	0
are	0
really	1
having	0
it	0
If	0
they'd	0
been	1
in	0
day	0
care	0
the	0
entire	1
time	1
and	0
it	0
wasn't	1
yeah	1
the	0
ones	1
that	0
are	0
now	0
getting	1
to	0
be	0
teenagers	1
and	0
in	0
some	0
cases	1
young	0
college	1

um-hum	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
some	1
time	0
day	1
care	0
is	0
really	0
good	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
sometimes	1
it's	0
just	1
it's	0
baby	1
sitting	0

yeah	1

it's	0
someone	1
you	0
know	0
keeping	0
an	0
eye	1
on	0
the	0
kids	1
but	0
the	0
kids	0
are	0
basically	1
doing	0
what	0
they	0
want	1
and	0
not	1
really	1
having	0
any	1
relationship	1
with	0
the	0
adults	1
to	0
say	0
you	0
know	0
here's	1
what's	0
right	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
here's	1
what's	0
wrong	1
and	0
and	0
here's	1
what	0
we	0
expect	1
of	0
you	0

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
that	1
was	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
main	0
reasons	1
that	0
i	0
quit	1
was	0
because	0
i	0
wanted	1
my	1
kids	0
to	0
have	0
my	1
values	0
and	0
i	0
felt	1
like	0
when	0
they	0
were	0
young	1
that	0
was	1
the	0
time	1
to	0
instill	1
it	0
that	0
it	1
could	0
be	1
it	0
could	0
be	0
added	1
to	0
and	0
strengthened	1
as	0
they	0
grew	0
older	1
but	0
when	1
they	0
were	0
little	1
you	0
know	0
this	1

yeah	1

this	1
is	0
the	0
way	0
i	1
feel	0
about	1
this	0
and	0
this	1
is	0
the	0
way	1
because_1	1
i	0
it's	0
you	1
know	0
when	1
you	0
when	0
you	0
if	0
you	1
if	0
you	0
teach	1
them	0
when	0
they're	0
little	1
the	0
way	1
you	0
want	1
them	0
to	0
be	1
and	0
the	0
things	1
that	0
are	0
important	0
to	0
you	1
then	0
you	0
just	1
you	0
add	1
onto	0
it	0
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

um-hum	0

but	0
if	0
no	1
one	0
does	0
anything	1
when	0
they're	0
little	1
then	0
it's	0
twice	1
as	0
hard	1
as	0
i	0
think	1
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

yeah	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
saying	1
this	0
as	0
i'm	0
trying	1
to	0
keep	0
my	0
nine	0
month	0
old	1
from	0
trashing	1
something	0

yes	1
i	0
understand	1
i	1
i	0
wait	1
until	0
i	0
put	0
mine	0
in	0
bed	1
before	0
i	0
make	0
my	0
calls	1

yeah	0
well	0
she's	1
usually	1
in	0
bed	0
by	0
this	0
time	0
but	0
she's	0
staying	1
up	0
late	1
tonight	0
but	0
yeah	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
have	0
a	0
relationship	0
with	0
her	1
you	0
know	0
m[y]	1
my	1
dad	0
was	0
a	0
very	0
traditional	0
dad	1
and	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
a	0
child	1
i	1
didn't	0
really	0
know	1
my	0
dad	0
very	0
well	0
and	0
i	0
miss	1
that	0
and	0
i	1
want	1

that's	1
the	0
thing	1
if	0
woman's	0
role	1
like	0
we	0
said	0
if	0
women's	1
roles	1
change	0
drastically	1
men's	1
roles	0
will	0
too	1

yeah	0
the	0
men	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
convinced	1
of	0
that	1

and	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
it's	0
for	0
the	0
better	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
women's	1
roles	0
i	0
think	0
are	0
almost	1
for	0
the	0
worse	1
because	0
we're	1
losing	1
out	0
on	0
some	0
things	1
going	0
back	0
to	0
work	1
but	1
i	0
think	1
if	0
we	0
can	1
if	0
we	0
can	0
expand	1
the	0
men's	0
roles	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	1
like	0
your	1
taking	0
care	0
of	0
your	0
child	1
and	0
your	0
dad	1
probably	0
didn't	0
very	1
often	0
i	0

no	1

i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
mine	1
almost	0
never	1
did	0
