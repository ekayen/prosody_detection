uh	1
yeah	1
we	1
do	1
we	1
um	1
uh	1
basically	1
there's	1
the	1
you	1
know	1
expenses	1
that	1
are	0
fixed	1
during	1
the	1
month	1
you	1
know	1
the	0
ones	1
that	1
come	1
every	1
every	0
month	1
and	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
we	1
uh	1
enter	1
those	1
into	0
uh	1
into	1
a	0
spread	1
sheet	0
and	0
uh	1
what's	0
ever	1
left	1
uh	0
after	0
that	1
we	1
you	1
know	1
we	1
we	0
sit	1
down	1
and	1
agree	1
on	1
kind	1
of	0
what	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
range	1
we're	1
gonna	1
generally	1
gonna	1
shoot	1
for	1

uh-huh	1

okay	1
um	0
well	0

so	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
do	1

well	0
that's	1
basically	0
what	0
we	0
do	1
um	0
about	1
every	1
every	0
three	1
months	1
or	0
so	1
we	0
reevaluate	1
our	0
budget	1
and	0
we	1
sit	0
down	1
and	0
just	0
write	1
from	0
the	0
largest	1
bills	0
down	0
to	1
the	0
smallest	1

um-hum	0

and	1
then	1
we	0
divvy	1
them	0
up	1
between	1
our	0
four	1
pay	1
checks	0
i	1
work	1
part	1
time	1
at	0
night	1

wow	0

and	1
he	1
works	1
and	1
my	1
husband	1
works	1
full	1
time	1
days	1
and	0
so	1
we	1
have	0
the	0
four	1
pay	0
checks	0
with	1
that	0
works	1
out	0
nice	1
because	0
we	1
get	0
paid	1
every	0
week	1
and	1
so	0
that	1
does	0
help	1

yeah	1

that	1
helps	1
a	0
lot	1
and	0
then	1
um	0
we	1
don't	0
have	0
a	0
lot	1
ex[tra]	0
extra	1
for	1
extra	1
spending	1
so	0

so	0
it's	1
pretty	0
well	1
earmarked	1

yeah	0
all	1
allocated	1
out	1

yeah	1

yeah	0

yeah	1
ev[ery]	0
every	1
penny	1
is	1
earmarked	1
but	1
um	1
it	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
that	1
works	1
the	0
best	1
and	1
and	1
so	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
just	1
divide	1
them	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
major	1
bills	1
up	1
in	1
fact	1
we	1
found	1
it	0
easier	1
to	1
divide	0
the	0
major	1
bills	1
up	1
you	1
know	1
cut	1
the	0
house	1
payment	0
in	0
half	1
and	1
cut	1
the	1
loan	1
payment	1
in	0
half	1
and	0
and	1
divide	1
those	1
up	1
between	1
all	1
um-hum	0

all	1
the	0
checks	1
yeah	1

and	0
so	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
taking	1
a	0
huge	1
sum	1
out	0
out	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
next	1
pay	0
check	0
we're	1
real	1
short	1
or	1

right	1
yeah	1
we	1
found	0
that	0
um	0
it's	1
definitely	1
helped	0
uh	0
get	1
a	1
handle	1
on	1
kind	1
of	1
the	0
unnecessary	1
expenses	1

that's	1
true	1

we	1
were	1
before	1
we	1
started	1
doing	1
that	1
kind	1
of	0
a	1
thing	1
we	1
were	1
um	1
spending	1
uh	0
money	1
for	1
things	1
that	0
you	1
know	1
we	0
probably	1
tended	0
to	0
eat	1
out	1
a	0
bit	0
more	1
than	0
the	0
than	1
we	0
should	1
have	0
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
it	0
was	1
easy	1
to	0
uh	1
let	1
things	0
get	0
out	1
of	1
hand	1
we	1
thought	1
it	1
uh	1
thought	1
it	0
to	0
be	0
really	0
helpful	1
we've	0
gotten	1
some	0
of	0
our	0
loans	1
paid	0
off	0
early	1
because	1
of	0
this	1
and	1
and	0
stuff	1
like	0
that	1
so	1

yeah	0

so	1

well	1
it	0
helps	1
you	0
to	0
focus	1
where	1
your	0
money	0
goes	1

yeah	1

and	1
and	0
i'm	0
sure	1
you	1
felt	0
the	0
s[ame]	0
the	0
same	1
frustration	1
before	1
you	0
got	0
on	0
a	0
budget	1
but	0
you're	0
wondering	1
my	0
when	0
you	0
put	1
down	0
all	1
the	0
money	0
that	0
you	0
do	1
bring	0
in	0
and	1
then	0
you're	0
saying	1
my	0
word	1
where	0
did	0
all	1
that	1
money	1
go	1

that's	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
money	1
but	0

where	1
does	0
it	1
go	1

yeah	0

huh	0

and	0
also	1
we	1
have	0
found	1
that	0
if	1
we	1
write	1
down	1
a[nd]	0
and	0
we	1
did	1
this	0
we're	1
not	0
real	1
consistent	1
with	0
this	0
but	0
we	0
did	1
it	0
for	0
about	0
a	0
month	1
and	1
we	1
wrote	1
down	1
everything	1
that	0
we	1
bought	1
with	0
you	1
know	1
every	1
paycheck	1

um-hum	0

and	0
so	0
we	1
could	0
see	1
where	0
every	1
penny	0
went	1
and	0
it	1
was	0
really	0
interesting	1
to	1
see	1
just	1
what	1
you	0
do	1
spend	0
and	1
and	1
like	0
i	1
say	1
we	0
haven't	1
been	0
real	1
consistent	1
with	1
it	1
it's	1
we	0
should	1
because_1	1
it	0
does	1
help	1

yeah	1
the	0
other	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
that	0
that	0
we've	1
found	0
that	0
that	0
helps	1
if	1
you	1
know	1
we	0
tend	1
to	0
fudge	1
on	0
the	0
budget	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
it's	1

uh-huh	1

it's	1
just	0
to	1
uh	1
uh	1
get	0
out	1
the	1
money	1
in	0
advance	1
and	0
put	0
it	0
in	1
uh	0
um	1
so	0
long	1
as	0
it	0
wasn't	1
you	1
know	1
unreasonably	1
high	1
but	1
for	1
things	1
like	1
food	1
expenses	1
or	1
or	1
whatever	1
just	1
put	1
it	0
in	1
a	0
in	0
an	1
envelope	1
or	0
whatever	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
that	1
way	1
it	0
kind	0
of	0
forced	1
us	0
to	0
uh	0
stick	1
to	0
that	0
amount	1
and	0
then	0
once	1
that	0
was	0
gone	1
well	1
if	1
the	0
entertainment	1
amount	0
was	1
gone	1
for	1
the	0
month	1
oh	0
it's	0
gone	1

just	1
stick	1
to	0
that	1
uh-huh	0
that	1
is	1

yeah	0
that	0
that	1
sounds	1
like	0
a	1
really	1
good	1
idea	0

so	1

and	0
it	0
really	1
helpful	1
um	1
have	1
you	0
developed	1
a	0
savings	1
plan	1
or	0
iras	1
or	0
anything	1
like	0
that	1
yet	1

we	1
we	1
haven't	0
we	1
our	0
our	0
initial	1
goal	0
was	0
just	1
to	0
retire	1
our	0
debt	1
uh	0
completely	1
retire	0
our	1
debt	1
for	0
car	1
payments	1
and	1
credit	1
card	1
uh	1
credit	1
card	1
debt	1
and	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
that	1
and	1

oh	1
uh-huh	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
we're	1
just	0
at	1
a	1
point	1
where	0
where	0
we	1
could	0
start	0
thinking	1
about	0
it	0
so	0

oh	0
that's	1
good	1
that's	1
a	0
good	0
feeling	1

yeah	1
i	0

my	0
husband	1
just	1
graduated	1
from	0
the	1
university	1
uh	0
a	1
year	1
ago	1

um-hum	0

so	0
finally	1
finally	1
we	1
are	1
getting	1
to	1
that	0
point	0
too	1

a	0
study	1

so	1
are	0
you	1
still	0
going	0
to	0
school	0
or	1

yeah	0
yeah	1
i'm	0
actually	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
mas[ter]	1

hello	1
ann	1

hello	1
chuck	1

um	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
i	1
attended	1
a	1
conference	1
here	1
at	1
utah	1
state	1
university	1
on	1
recycling	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	1
i	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
interested	1
to	0
hear	1
because_1	1
they	1
had	1
some	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
epa	1
and	1
lots	1
of	0
different	1
places	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	1
they	1
had	0
basically	1
decided	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	0
a	0
real	1
problem	1
here	1
within	1
a	1
few	0
years	1
on	0
solid	1
waste	1

um	0
i	0
didn't	0
think	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
new	1
revelation	1

well	1
it's	0
not	1
too	1
new	0

right	1
so	1
what	1
what	1
i[s]	0
is	1
the	1
epa	1
recommending	1
now	1

oh	0
they	1
really	1
didn't	0
propose	1
any	0
solutions	1
actually	1
they	0
were	0
the	1
guy	1
was	1
pretty	1
negative	1
about	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
was	1
doing	0
even	1
though	0
he	1
was	0
from	1
the	1
epa	1

um-hum	1

but	0
he	1
had	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	1
facts	1
to	1
to	1
give	1
and	1
things	0
like	0
how	1
many	0
solid	1
waste	0
plants	1
were	0
being	0
shut	1
down	1
and	0
and	1
uh	0
uh	0
one	0
of	1
the	0
most	1
interesting	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
was	1
recycling	1
of	1
of	1
news	1
print	0
and	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
um	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
new	1
york	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
collected	1
all	1
this	1
news	1
print	1

yeah	0

and	1
they	1
could	1
sell	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
they	0
were	1
able	1
to	1
sell	1
it	0
for	0
some	1
amount	1
per	1
ton	1
and	1
now	1
at	0
this	1
stage	0
of	0
the	1
game	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
gotten	1
into	0
recycling	1
they've	0
collected	1
so	1
much	1
news	1
print	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
hauled	0
away	1

why	1
that's	1
a	0
that's	0
a	0
common	1
problem	0
now	1
that	0
seems	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
in	1
dallas	1
as	0
well	1
as	0
new	1
york	1
and	1
i	0
try	1
to	0
recycle	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
newspapers	0
that	0
come	0
to	0
my	1
house	0
and	0
after	1
a	0
while	1
i	1
just	1
quit	0
taking	0
the	0
newspaper	1
because	0
i	0
couldn't	1
recycle	1
it	0
anymore	0
which	1
isn't	1
good	1
for	0
business	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
either	1
i	1
suppose	1

yeah	0
we're	1
doing	0
some	0
here	1
in	0
in	1
cash	1
valley	1
the	1
community	1
here	1

um-hum	1

there's	1
uh	1
we've	1
actually	1
got	1
a	0
kind	1
of	1
a	0
nice	1
set	0
up	0
we've	1
got	1
a	0
couple	0
of	1
plants	1
here	1
that	1
actually	1
take	0
uh	1
recycled	0
paper	1
and	1
shred	1
it	0
and	1
spray	1
it	0
with	0
chemical	0
treatment	1
so	0
that	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
fire	1
hazard	1
and	1
make	0
it	0
into	0
insulation	1

right	1

and	0
they	1
can	1
actually	0
use	1
as	1
much	1
recycled	1
paper	0
as	1
the	1
community	1
can	1
get	1
to	1
them_1	0
because	1
they're	0
actually	1
buying	1
it	1
and	1
shipping	1
it	0
in	0
from	1
outside	1

well	0
that's	1
good	1

so	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
real	0
keys	1
it	0
sounds	1
like	0
to	0
getting	0
recycling	1
for	0
uh	0
paper	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1
to	0
go	1
is	0
to	0
get	1
some	0
sort	1
of	1
business	1
to	1
actually	0
want	1
it	0
once	1
you've	0
collected	1
it	1

right	1
there	0
has	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
a	0
reuse	1
for	0
it	0
i	0
mean	0
that's	0
why	1
they	0
recycle	1
the	0
one	0
i	1
think	0
is	0
the	0
most	1
interesting	1
is	0
with	0
the	0
recycled	1
bottles	1
and	0
all	1
that	0
uh	0
the	0
industry	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
doing	1
with	0
the	0
recycled	1
polymers	1
uh	0
everything	1
from	0
uh	0
waste	1
baskets	1
to	0
carpet	1
to	0
the	1
no	1
stick	0
i	1
mean	0
the	0
sticky	1
slide	1
rugs	0
under	1
the	0
carpet	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
they're	0
even	1
putting	1
it	0
in	0
the	1
roadways	1
these	1
days	1
and	0
they're	1
making	0
clothes	1
now	1
that	1
are	1
recycled	1
like	1
the	0
recycled	1
plastic	0
coke	1
bottles	0
and	1
and	0
milk	1
cartons	0
and	0
things	1
like	1
that	1

and	1
there's	1
a	0
paper	0
presented	1
at	0
this	0
conference	1
from	0
a	0
guy	1
from	1
alabama	1
and	0
he	1
was	1
kind	0
of	0
hired	1
to	1
do	1
a	0
study	1
by	0
two	1
departments	1
for	0
the	1
government	1
one	1
was	0
like	0
environmental	1
protection	1
and	0
the	1
other	1
one	0
was	0
oh	0
i	1
can't	1
remember	0
what	0
but	1
the	0
basic	1
idea	1
it	1
was	0
presented	1
to	0
him	1
was	0
how	1
can	1
we	1
maximize	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
energy	1
that	1
we	0
can	0
get	1
back	1
from	0
recycling	1
and	1
minimize	1
the	0
volume	1
of	1
stuff	1
we	0
are	0
putting	1
into	1
our	1
landfill	1

um-hum	0

and	1
uh	0
the	1
solution	1
that	1
he	1
came	0
up	0
with	0
for	0
plastics	1
and	0
it	0
was	1
really	1
quite	1
amazing	1
because_1	1
he	0
says	1
well	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
with	0
plastics	1
is	1
to	0
burn	1
them_1	0

oh	1
really	1

he	0
came	1
to	0
the	0
conclusion	1
plastics	1
is	0
actually	1
one	0
of	0
the	1
biggest	1
problems	1
in	1
landfills	1
cause	0
it's	1
it's	0
low	1
weight	1
but	0
it's	0
high	1
volume	1
so	0
it	0
takes	1
up	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
space	1

right	1

and	1
there's	0
almost	1
no	1
energy	1
there's	0
very	1
little	0
energy	1
value	0
in	0
actually	1
doing	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
recycling	1
but	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
energy	0
in	0
it	0
if	0
you	1
can	0
burn	1
it	0
and	0
use	0
it	0
to	0
produce	1
electricity	1

huh	0

so	1
his	1
solution	1
was	0
to	0
burn	1
plastic	1
collect	1
it	0
and	0
burn	1
it	0

well	1
it's	0
carbon	1
so	0
that	1
makes	0
sense	1
like	0
a	1
carbon	1
fuel	1
of	1
some	1
sort	0
but	0
what	1
what	0
about	1
emissions	1

yeah	1

and	0
it's	0
more	1
than	0
even	0
paper	1
or	0
something	1
like	0
that	0
there's	0
more	1
energy	0
in	0
it	0
per	0
pound	1
or	0
whatever	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
he	0
didn't	1
deal	1
with	0
that	1

oh	1

he	0
just	1
said	0
burn	1
it	0

okay	1

he	0
didn't	0
talk	1
about	0
cleaning	1
it	0
up	1
or	0
anything	0
like	0
that	1
so	0
it's	0
not	1
very	0
practical	1
is	0
it	0

no	1
well	1
that's	1
interesting	1
i	0
bet	0
that	1
was	0
a	0
good	1
day	1
at	0
the	1
uh	0
conference	1
then	1

yeah	1
well	0
real	1
interest[ing]	0

did	0
it	0
change	1
anything	0
for	0
you	1

um	1
not	1
too	0
much	1
i'm	1
uh	0
i	1
got	0
a	1
bit	1
actuall[y]	0

okay	1

[ok]ay	1
um	1
so	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
um	1
about	1
putting	1
an	1
elderly	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
it	1
varies	1
on	1
on	0
the	1
individual	1
basis	1

hm	0

uh	1
sometimes	1
it	1
is	1
there's	1
no	1
alternative	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
have	1
uh	0
uh	1
family	1
available	1
or	1
family	1
that's	0
uh	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
even	1
have	1
family	1
that	1
is	1
uh	1
in	1
and	1
who	1
around	1

that's	1
true	1
yeah	1

so	1
sometimes	1
it's	1
not	1
an	1
alternative	1

hm	0

and	1
i	1
think	1
uh	1
but	1
i	1
think	1
also	1
sometimes	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
uh	1
a	1
benefit	1
if	1
it's	1
for	1
a	1
short	0
time	1
sometimes	1
in	0
a	1
nursing	1
home	0

um-hum	0

um	1
especially	1
after	0
if	1
it's	1
after	1
an	0
acute	0
illness	1
to	1
get	1
over	1
a	1
uh	0
or	1
to	1
rehab	1
after	1
uh	0
an	0
illness	1

that's	1
true	1
i	0
never	0
thought	1
of	0
that	0
yeah	0

sometimes	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
sometimes	1
the	0
nursing	1
homes	0
are	0
good	1
for	0
uh	0
just	1
short	1
periods	1
of	0
time	1

that's	0
true	1
until	1
they	0
get	0
over	0
that	0
hump	1
of	0
whatever	1
it	1
is	0
they're	1
dealing	1
with	0

um-hum	1

because	1
too	1
often	1
the	1
acute	1
hospitals	1
will	1
are	1
sending	1
them_1	1
out	1
much	1
faster	1
than	1
what	1
they're	0
really	0
able	1
to	1

yes	1

they	1
really	1
are	1
they	1
don't	0
like	0
to	0
keep	1
them	1
longer	1
than	1
a	0
week	0

so	1
so	0
there	1
is	1
some	0
good	1
to	0
it	0

yeah	1

uh	1
sometimes	1
too	1
it's	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
dumb	1
job	0
you	1
know	1
the	1
fam[ilies]	1
well	1
the	0
families	1
do	0
not	1
necessarily	1
uh	0
know	0
what	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
them_1	0
and	0

what	1
do	0
you	0
mean	1

and	0
they	0
don't	1
wanna	0
take	0
the	0
responsibility	1
so	0
they	0
will	0
put	1
them_1	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	0
home	0

yeah	1
that's	1
true	1

so	0
you	1
see	1
uh	0
there's	0
both	1
sides	1
to	0
it	1
too	1
what	1
do	0
you	1
think	0

yeah	1
and	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
how	1
how	0
sick	1
the	0
person	1
is	0
too	1
and	0
what	1
you're	0
capable	1
of	0
like	1
if	0
you	0
have	1
a	1
family	1
to	1
take	0
care	1
of	1
you	0
know	1
of	0
your	0
own	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
um	0
i	1
would	0
personally	0
like	0
it	0
if	0
my	1
parents	0
were	0
to	1
get	0
ill	1
i	1
would	0
like	0
to	0
take	1
care	0
of	0
them	1
at	0
home	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
the	1
money	0
with	0
some	0
help	1
that's	1
not	0
always	0
possible	1

that's	0
true	1

but	1
um	0
to	0
the	0
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
i'd	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
it	0
until	1
it	1
gets	1
impossible	1

i	1
think	1
that's	1
also	1
where	1
you're	1
gonna	0
to	1
have	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	0
are	1
going	1
to	0
it's	0
there's	0
not	0
a	1
choice	1
it's	1
because_1	1
there	0
it's	0
not	1
economically	0
feasible	1
even	0
to	1
put	1
them_1	0
in	1
a	0
nursing	0
home	1

right	1

um-hum	1

yeah	1

so	0
that	0
that	0
option	1
sometimes	1
is	0
not	0
available	1
if	0
they	1
do	0
not	0
have	0
the	0
uh	0
either	0
medicare	1
or	0
insurance	1
to	0
cover	1
it	0

that's	0
true	1
yeah	0

so	0

but	1
i	1
think	1
nursing	1
homes	0
can	1
be	0
good	1
just	0
depends	1
on	0
what	0
kind	1
they	1
are	0
you	0
know	1
an	0
you	0
need	1
to	0
check	0
them_1	0
out	0
ahead	1
of	0
time	1

yeah	1
and	0
then	0
there's	1
also	1
some	1
that	0
are	0
set	1
up	1
for	1
specialties	1
uh	1

um-hum	0

uh	1
i	1
know	0
some	0
el[derly]	0
unfortunately	1
some	1
elderly	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	0
or	1
have	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
alzheimer's	1
or	0
where	1
they	1
wander	1
or	0
or	0
um	0
confused	1
or	1
have	0
some	1
mental	1
problems	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1
that	1
they're	1

and	1
you	1
need	1
a	1
special	1
nursing	1
home	0
for	0
that	1
you	0
need	1
one	1
that	0
has	0
a	0
unit	1
that's	0
locked	1
where	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	0
to	0
get	0
out	1
and	0
roam	0
around	1

yeah	1

and	0
you	0
need	0
people	1
who	0
are	0
trained	1
for	0
that	1
type	1
of	0
problem	1

right	1

an[d]	0
know	1
what	0
they're	0
doing	1
with	0
that	0

yeah	0
so	1
so	0
there's	0
different	1
types	1
of	0
nursing	0
homes	0
i	0
think	1

yeah	1
well	0
my	0
uh	0
grandmother's	1
not	1
really	0
in	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
but	0
a	0
retirement	1
home	0
that	0
also	0
has	0
a	0
nursing	1
home	0
sort	0
of	0
attached	1
to	1
it	0
and	1
she	1
really	0
liked	1
the	0
idea	0
of	0
of	0
moving	1
there	0
she's	1
not	0
ill	1
yet	1

um-hum	1

but	1
um	0
she	1
worked	0
there	0
as	0
a	0
volunteer	1
for	0
about	0
ten	1
years	1
and	0
then	0
she	1
decided	0
that	1
um	0
she's	0
eighty	1
five	0
years	0
old	1
that	0
eventually	1
you	1
know	0
she	1
she	1
doesn't	1
want	1
her	0
family	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
her	0
and	0
being	0
a	0
burden	1
she's	0
very	0
independent	1
so	0
she's	1
in	0
this	0
nursing	1
home	0
it's	0
out	0
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
um	0
she	0
really	1
enjoys	1
it	1
right	1
now	1
because	1
she	0
doesn't	1
have	0
to	0
wash	0
dishes	1
or	0
cook	1

gives	1
her	0
a	1
little	0
bit	0
of	0
her	0
own	0
independence	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
she	1
still	1
has	0
uh	0
a	0
security	1
there	0

right	1
some	1
support	1
and	0
then	1
there's	0
also	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
a	0
wing	1
for	0
those	1
people	0
that	1
do	1
get	0
sick	1
and	0
what	1
i	1
like	0
about	1
it	1
and	1
i	0
think	0
she	1
likes	0
about	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
she	0
knows	1
everybody	0
there	0
now	1
and	1
then	1
so	1
if	0
she	0
ever	0
does	1
become	0
ill	0
um	0
it'll	1
be	1
like	1
family	1
around	0
her	1

that's	0
right	1
and	1
i	0
i've	0
seen	1
some	1
of	1
them	0
like	0
that	1
too	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
also	1
they	0
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
activities	1
going	0
on	1
for	0
the	1
ones	0
who	1
are	0
more	1
active	1

um-hum	1

yeah	1
sh[e]	1

so	0
it's	0
not	1
sort	0
of	0
like	0
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
sick	1
place	1

um-hum	0

no	1
she	0
loves	1
it	0
she	1
had	0
a	0
great	1
social	1
life	0
and	0
she	0
travels	1
and	0
um	0
it's	0
in	0
in	0
missouri	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
mountains	1
and	0
it's	0
beautiful	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
i	1
hope	1
that	0
i	1
have	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
when	0
i	1
get	0
older	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
of	1
the	0
um	0
i	1
think	1
the	1
the	0
decision	1
that	0
needs	0
to	0
be	1
made	1
though	0
on	1
nursing	1
home	0
has	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
joint	1
one	0
between	0
the	0
the	0
uh	0
elderly	1
uh	0
person	1
who's	0
going	0
in	1
and	0
the	1
family	1
that's	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
uh	0
effec[ted]	1
effected	1
by	0
it	0

um-hum	0

oh	0

oh	0
definitely	1
it's	0

and	0
uh	0
you	1
know	1
sometimes	1
it	1
can	0
those	0
choi[ces]	1
those	0
choices	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
in	0
advance	1
and	0
sometimes	1
the	1
choices	1
uh	0
because	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	0
the	0
illness	0
when	0
they're	0

right	1

okay	1

okay	1
i	1
thought	0
it	1
was	0
supposed	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
recording	1
but	1
anyway	1
um	1
well	1
i	0
i	1
do	1
take	0
care	1
of	0
pretty	0
much	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
stuff	1
for	1
for	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
um	1
i	1
embarrassed	1
to	1
say	0
it's	1
pretty	1
trivial	1

um-hum	0

all	1
we	1
all	1
i	1
do	1
is	1
uh	1
keep	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
things	1
like	1
debts	1
that	1
are	1
outstanding	1
and	0
and	1
every	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
months	0
update	1
that	1
and	0
every	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
while	1
make	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
spent	1
that	1
month	1
but	1
i	1
doubt	1
i	1
do	1
it	1
more	1
than	0
three	1
times	1
a	0
year	1

um-hum	0
do	1
you	0
use	0
a	0
computer	1

and	1

no	1
i	1
work	1
with	1
them_1	1
all	0
day	0
yeah	0
i'm	0
in	1
computer	0
science	1
yet	0
i	0
i	1
do	0
everything	0
on	1
paper	1

oh	0

uh-huh	1

uh	1
i	1
don't	1
even	1
use	0
a	1
calculator	1
for	1
the	1
stuff	0
i'm	1
doing	1
because_1	1
it's	1
all	1
pretty	0
round	1
numbers	0

yeah	1
mine	1
is	1
really	0
simple	1
because	0
i	1
got	0
all	1
our	0
bills	0
paid	0
off	1
when	1
um	0
he	1
was	1
a	0
marine	1
he	0
went	1
to	1
saudi	1
arabia	1
and	1
while	0
he	1
was	1
gone	1
i	1
got	0
all	1
of	0
our	0
bills	0
paid	1
off	1
so	0
really	1
the	0
only	1
bills	1
i	1
have	1
is	1
rent	1
utilities	1
insurance	1
you	1
know	1
so	1

um-hum	0

so	1
they	0
come	1
in	1
i	1
pay	1
them_1	1
and	0
that's	0
it	1
you	1
know	0
that's	1
about	1
the	0
extent	1
of	1
it	0
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
i	0

i	0
don't	1
really	1
have	1
this	0
major	1
budget	1
or	0
anything	1
i	1
just	1
really	1
i'm	1
real	1
thrifty	1
i	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	1
know	1
two	0
children	1
and	0
me	1
and	1
um	1
just	1
real	1
careful	1
with	0
the	1
money	1
you	1
know	0
what	0
little	1
we	0
have	1

um-hum	1

so	1
that's	0
what	0
i	1
do	1

yeah	1
it's	1
a	1
pretty	1
straightforward	1
it's	1
almo[st]	1
i	1
can't	1
imagine	1
having	1
to	1
go	0
into	1
real	1
complicated	1
stuff	1
and	1
making	1
you	1
know	1
fancy	1
budgets	1
it	1

no	1

it	1
seems	1
like	1
if	0
you're	1
getting	1
to	0
that	1
level	0
y[ou're]	1
you're	1
not	1
in	1
real	0
good	1
control	1

huh-uh	0
you	1
know	1
i	1
mean	1
i	1
i	1
i've	1
never	1
liked	1
credit	1
cards	1
and	1
a	0
lot	0
of	1
debt	1
you	1
know	1
you	0

uh-huh	0

you	0
buy	1
something	0
on	0
credit	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
you	0
pay	0
twice	0
as	0
much	1
for	0
it	0
when	0
you	0
get	0
done	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

so	1

actually	1
i'm	1
i	0
me[an]	1
i	1
like	1
using	1
credit	1
cards	0
for	1
everything	1
but	1
just	1
paying	1
off	0
the	1
bills	1
because	1
that	1
way	0
it's	1
a	0
record	1
of	1
everything	0
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	0
don't	1
have	0
to	0
worry	1
about	1
keeping	1
records	1
of	0
anything	1
else	1
because	1
they	0
come	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
month	1

i	0
don't	1
have	0
too	1
many	0
wea[knesses]	0
i	0
don't	1
have	1
too	1
many	1
weaknesses	1
but	1

but	1
i	1
found	1
out	0
a	1
credit	1
card	0
was	0
one	1
of	1
them_1	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0

uh	0

it's	0
so	1
much	1
easy	1
easier	1
you	1
know	1
if	0
something's	1
on	1
sale	1
if	1
you're	0
a	1
woman	1
and	0
you're	0
a	1
sale	1
person	0
it's	1

it's	1
like	0
oh	1
well	1
that's	0
on	0
sale	1
let's	1
go	0
grab	1
it	0
you	1
know	1
so	1
um	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
money	1
then	0
use	0
the	0
credit	1
card	0
so	1
i	1
got	0
rid	1
of	0
them	0
credit	1
cards	0
you	0
know	1

yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
if	0
that's	0
if	0
that's	0
a	0
weakness	1
that's	0
a	0
good	0
thing	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	1
that	1
was	0
my	0
weakness	1
it	1
wasn't	1
bad	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
didn't	1
have	1
like	1
thousands	1
of	0
dollars	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
like	0
that	1
just	0
i	1
just	0
learned	1
that	0
that	1
wasn't	0
for	0
me	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	1

sure	1

so	1
but	0
i	1
self	1
employed	1
you	0
know	0
i	1
have	1
my	0
own	1
little	1
cleaning	1
business	1
type	1
thing	1
so	0
um	1
i	0
keep	0

do	1
you	1
find	1
trouble	1
keeping	0
the	0
records	0
for	0
taxes	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
or	0

no	1
it's	0
not	0
hard	1
i	0
just	1
keep	0
it	0
in	0
a	0
notebook	1
and	0
write	1
down	0
what	1
i've	0
made	1
and	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
what	1
it's	0
gonna	0
have	0
to	1
go	1
for	1
that	1
month	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
it's	0
not	1
that	0
not	0
that	0
hard	1
not	1
at	1
all	1

uh-huh	1

well	0
that's	1
good	0
to	0
know	1

so	1
i	1
always	0
do	1
my	0
own	0
income	1
tax	1
you	0
know	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	1

i	0
don't	1
understand	0
the	0
idea	0
of	0
paying	1
somebody	0
to	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

huh	1

it	0
seems	1
like	0
it's	0
absurd	1
the	0
number	1
of	0
people	0
who	1
had	0
to	0
having	0
to	1
pay	1
somebody	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

rea[d]	1
all	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
do	1
is	0
read	1
a	0
book	1
i	1
mean	0
read	1
the	0
little	0
book	1
they	0
send	0
you	0
fill	1
in	0
the	1
blanks	1
and	0
go	1

i	0

yeah	1
just	0
the	0
form	1

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
it	0
seems	1
absurd	1
that	1
people	0
will	1
pay	1
you	0
know	1
some	0
bucks	1
just	1
to	0
get	0
someone	1
to	0

yeah	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
them_1	0

it's	0
dumb	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
guess	1
if	0
you	0
had	0
some	1
really	1
complicated	0
stuff	1
but	0
i	1
don't	0
so	0
i	1
don't	0
mess	1
with	0
it	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
don't	0
use	0
a	1
calculator	1
either	1
you	1
know	1
i	1

i	0
i	1
don't	0
trust	0
myself	0
with	0
using	0
a	0
calculator	1
or	0
computer	1
to	0
too	1
much	0
stuff	0
like	1
that	0
because	0
i	1
wanna	0
make	1
sure	0
that	1
that	0
i	1
i	1
keep	0
on	0
top	1
of	0
the	0
numbers	0
and	0
understand	1
what's	0
going	0
on	1
i	0

i	1
don't	1
i	1
don't	0
have	1
that	0
mu[ch]	1
that	1
many	1
you	1
know	1
things	1
to	0
add	0
up	1
so	1

i	0
know	0
too	1
many	0
people	0
who	0
use	0
a	1
calculator	1
if	1
they	0
make	1
a	0
mistake	1
they	1
find	0
out	0
two	1
months	0
later	1
because	1
they	0
weren't	1
paying	1
attention	1

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
yeah	0

and	0
we	1
have	0
a	0
i	0

i	1
bank	0
at	0
ncnb	0
here	1
and	0
they	1
have	0
a	0
number	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
call	1
in	0
and	0
i	1
always	0
call	0
in	0
like	1
once	1
every	0
other	0
week	0
or	0
so	0
and	0
i	0
will	0
um	0
check	0
off	1
what	0
checks	1
have	1
cleared	0
and	1

yeah	0

do	0
you	1
do	0
that	1

we	1
have	0
the	0
same	0
thing	1

you	1
do	1
too	1

yeah	1

and	1
i	1
always	1
check	1
them_1	0
off	0
and	1
you	0
know	1
check	0
my	0
balance	0
and	0
my	0
book	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
because_1	0
i	1
always	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
exactly	1
what	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	1

sure	1

i	0
do	0
that	1
real	1
often	0
i	0
do	1
that	1
so	0
anyway	1

okay_1	1
so	1
what	1
are	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
views	1
o[n]	1
on	1
capital	1
punishment	1

i	1
have	1
ambivalent	1
feelings	1
because	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
it	1
serves	1
as	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
deterrent	1
we	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	0
hand	1
it	0
is	1
very	1
very	1
expensive	0
to	1
maintain	1
you	1
know	1
texas	1
has	1
one	1
of	1
the	0
biggest	1
criminal	1
justice	1
systems	1
in	1
the	1
country	1

yes	1

and	1
it's	1
eating	1
us	0
alive	1
budget	1
wise	1
and	1
um	1

so	1
are	1
they	1
currently	1
practicing	1
capital	1
punishment	1
in	1
your	1
state	1

yes	1
we	1
do	1
practice	1
capital	0
punishment	1

but	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
uh	1
courts	1
and	1
the	1
appeals	1
and	1
the	1
stays	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
means	1
that	0
it's	1
a	1
very	1
long	0
haul	0
before	1
anybody's	1
ever	1
executed	1

yes	1
that's	1
similar	1
to	1
georgia	1

yeah	0
and	1
then	1
i	1
was	1
reading	1
in	0
the	1
paper	1
just	0
this	1
morning	1
it's	1
interesting	1
because_1	1
i	0
had	1
forgotten	1
i	1
guess	1
that	1
i	1
wrote	1
this	1
little	1
topic	0
down	1
that	1
it	1
costs	0
more	1
to	1
execute	1
somebody	1
tha[n]	0
than	1
it	1
does	1
to	1
keep	1
them_1	0
because	1
of	0
all	0
the	1
costs	1
of	1
the	0
appeals	1
and	1
all	1
that	0
you	0
know	1

that's	1
probably	1
true	1
considering	1

yes	1

yes	1
um	1
i	1
guess	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	0
it	1
it	0
kind	1
of	1
defeats	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
having	1
capital	1
punishment	1
if	1

well	1
i	1
think	1
capital	1
punishment	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	0
be	1
primarily	1
a	1
deterrent	1
to	0
other	1
people	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
would	1
see	1
it	1

yes	1

right	1
that	1
would	0
be	1
the	1
intent	1
of	0
it	1

yeah	1
but	1
i'm	1
not	1
sure	1
how	1
successful	1
that	1
is	1

well	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
would	1
be	1
more	0
successful	1
if	1
it	0
was	1
applied	1
in	0
a	0
more	0
expedient	1
manner	1
if	1
there	0
weren't	1
so	1
many	1
appeals	1

quicker	1
maybe	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
if	0
if	1
the	1
person	1
who's	0
gonna	1
commit	1
the	0
crime	1
knew	1
that	0
they	1
were	0
gonna	0
be	1
punished	0
severely	1
possibly	1
capital	1
punishment	1

um-hum	1

what	0
what	1
kind	0
of	0
work	1
do	0
you	0
do	0

uh	1
i'm	1
a	1
research	1
engineer	1
i	0
work	1
uh	1
f[or]	1
with	0
georgia	1
tech	1

hum	1
well	1
see	0
i'm	1
a	0
school	1
principal	1

um	1

elementary	1
school	1

yes	1

and	1
in	1
a	0
very	1
poor	1
section	1
of	1
town	1
with	1
pr[edominantly]	1
predominantly	1
anglo	1
kids	1
and	0
i	1
see	0
kids	0
already	1
that	1
are	0
gonna	0
be	1
criminals	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
everything	1
we	0
can	0
do	1

hum	0

and	1
see	0
i'm	1
afraid	1
i	1
think	0
if	1
we	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
equivalent	1
amount	1
of	1
money	1
and	0
invest	1
it	1
in	0
young	1
people	0
that	0
i	1
mean	1
course	0
you	0
couldn't	1
do	1
that	1
because_1	1
you	0
got	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
the	1
ones	0
that	1
are	1
already	0
there	1

um-hum	1

but	0
i	0
think	1
if	1
we	0
would	1
make	0
a	0
bigger	1
investment	1
in	1
kids	1
we'd	1
have	1
fewer	1
decisions	1
to	1
make	1
down	0
the	0
road	1
you	0
know	1

um	0
that's	0
probably	1
true	1
but	0
i	0
guess	1
there's	0
other	1
factors	0
that	1

oh	1
yeah	0

but	0
pu[mping]	1
pu[mping]	1
pumping	1
more	0
money	0
into	0
the	1
school	1
system	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
but	1

well	1
i'm	1
not	1
talking	1
about_1	1
just	1
in	1
the	0
school	1
system	0

but	1
it's	0
not	1
gonna	1

oh	0
i	1
see	1

see	0
i'm	1
talking	0
about_1	1
like	0
in	1
in	0
uh	0
i'm	1
afraid	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
kids	1
who	0
just	0
ought	0
to	1
be	0
taken	1
out	1
of	1
their	0
homes	1
and	1
reared	1
uh	0
i	0
know	0
institutions	1
don't	0
work	0
that	1
well	1
but	0
it's	0
a	1
bad	1
day	1
because_1	1
because_1	0
i	1
have	0
all	1
these	1
kids	1
through	1
my	1
office	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
school	1
of	1
five	0
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
seven	0
kids	1

um-hum	0

five	1
hundred	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
good	1
solid	0
kids	1
and	0
i	1
have	0
the	0
same	1
thirty	1
seven	1
in	1
my	0
office	0
every	1
day	0

um	0

and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
their	0
parents	1
are	1
totally	1
irresponsible	1
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
in	1
the	0
penal	1
system	0

so	0
that's	1
a	1
difficult	1
situation	1

and	1
you	1
know	0
you	1
just	1
see	0
those	1
kids	0
going	0
down	0
the	1
road	1
now	1
not	0
all	1
of	1
them_1	0
will	1
commit	0
offenses	1
that	0
have	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
capital	1
punishment	0
but	0
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
have	0
already	0
been	0
in	0
youth	1
centers	0
and	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	0
and	0

um	0

and	0
if	1
we	1
had	0
something	1
to	0
do	1
before	1
they	1
get	0
to	0
be	1
full	1
blown	0
adult	0
criminals	1
and	0
i'm	1
not	0
talking	1
about_1	0
necessarily	0
in	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
that	0
the	0
school	1
system	0
should	0
be	1
the	1
agent	0
of	1
all	1
the	0
social	1
action	1

um-hum	0

i	1
think	1
that's	1
one	1
reason	0
we	0
have	0
problems	1
in	0
school	0
sys[tems]	0
uh	0
and	1
some	1
of	0
them_1	0
are	0
our	1
problems	1
but	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
it's	0
because	1
everything	0
society	0
wants	1
we're	1
supposed	0
to	0
do	1

um-hum	1

but	1
that's	1
another	1
subject	0
but	1

well	0
that's	1
probably	0
true	1
wh[at]	0

anyway	1
i	1
dealt	0
with	1
two	0
or	1
three	0
kids	0
today	1
that	0
are	1
gonna	0
end	0
up	1
where	0
somebody	1
has	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
decision	1
what	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
them_1	0

hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
guess	1
that's	0
not	0
an	0
easy	0
solution	1
there's	0
there's	0
no	0
easy	0
solution	1
for	0
that	1

um-hum	0

i	1
don't	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
that	0
there	0
is	1
an	0
easy	0
solution	0
but	0
if	1
you	0
could	0
find	1
a	0
way	0
to	0
prevent	1
some	0
of	0
it	0
and	0
i'm	1
not	1
sure	0
what	1
it	0
would	0
be	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
money	1
better	0
spent	1
than	0

um-hum	1

do	0
you	1
know	0
it	0
costs	1
more	1
to	0
keep	1
an	0
inmate	1
on	1
death	1
row	1
than	0
it	0
does	0
to	0
send	0
a	0
kid	0
to	0
harvard	1

that's	0
true	1

i'm	0
sure	0
it	0
is	1
yeah	1

statistically	1
that's	0
true	1

hum	0
yeah	1
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
certainly	1
capital	0
punishment	0
isn't	0
gonna	0
solve	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
problems	1
but	0

um-hum	0

but	0

are	0
you	1
for	0
it	0

uh	0

i'm	1
for	0
it	0
in	0
in	0
some	1
cases	1

i	0
guess	1
i	0
am	1
for	0
certain	0
cri[mes]	0
yeah	1

yeah	1

yeah	1
in	0
certain	1
crimes	0

what	0
kind	0
of	0
crimes	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
use	1
it	0
for	0

um	0
premeditated	1
murder	1
crimes	0
of	0
that	1
nature	0
i	1
think	0
should	0
definitely	1

um-hum	0

any	0
mass	1
murderer	1
type	0
individual	0

i	1
i	1
would	1
consider	1
it	0
for	0
sexual	1
abuse	0
of	0
children	1
on	1
going	1
you	1
know	0
not	1
one	0
instance	0
but	0
perpetual	1
abusers	0
of	0
children	0

hum	0

um-hum	0
well	0
you	0
always	1
have	1
castration	1

well	0
you	1
know	0
somebody	1
elected	1
that	0
recently	0

yes	1
i	0
read	1
about	0
that	1

and	0
all	1
the	0
civil	0
rights	1
people	0
are	0
up	0
in	0
arms	1
about	0
it	0
you	0
know	0

um-hum	0

but	0
uh	0

right	1
okay	1

yes	1

okay	1
how	1
many	1
kids	1
do	1
you	1
have	1

i	1
think	1
w[e]	1
i	0
think	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
parents	1
spending	1
time	1
with	1
their	1
children	1
we	1
have	1
three	1
children	1
who	1
are	1
eleven	1
nine	1
and	0
eight	1

right	1

so	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
big	0
issue	1
with	1
us	1
although	1
i	1
don't	1
recall	1
marking	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
little	1
things	1
to	1
talk	1
about	0
but	1
perhaps	1
they	1
are	0
looking	1
for	1
uh	1
words	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
like	1
day	1
care	1
and	1
quality	1
time	1
and	1

and	1

uh-huh	0

anyway	1
you	1
don't	0
have	0
children	1

no	1

but	0
you're	1
married	1

yeah	0
w[e]	0
we	1
been	0
married	0
for	0
two	0
and	0
a	0
half	0
years	0
we've	1
been	0
trying	1
for	0
about	0
two	1
years	0
but	0
no	1
luck	1
yet	1

oh	0

hopefully	1

you	1
know	1
i	1
know	1
we're	1
not	1
supposed	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
long	1
distance	1
but	1
actually	1
i'm	1
getting	0
a	1
call	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
i	0
could	1
possibly	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
call	1
waiting	1
could	1
i	0
ask	1
you	1
to	1
hold	1
one	1
minute	1

uh-huh	1

i'll	1
be	1
right	1
back	0
excuse	1
me	1
just	1
a	0
moment	1
they're	1

had	1

they're	1
gonna	1
get	1
mad	1

she	0
has	0
three	1
kids	0
eleven	1
nine	1
and	0
eight	1

hello	1

uh-huh	1

i'm	1
so	1
sorry	1

all	1
right	1

that	1
was	1
my	1
daughter's	1
brownie	1
leader	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
there	0
is	1
a	1
meeting	1
tomorrow	1
brownie	1
meeting	0

okay	0
so	0

so	0
it	0
keeps	1
you	0
bu[sy]	1
do	0

do	0
you	0
have	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
activities	1
with	0
your	0
kids	0

well	1
i	1
don't	0
wanna	1
i	1
don't	1
want	0
this	1
to	0
be	1
a	1
unilateral	1
conversation	0
but	1
yes	1
we	1
do	1
both	1

both	1
my	1
husband	1
and	0
i	1
work	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
are	1
sixth	1
fourth	1
and	1
third	1
grade	1
and	1
the	0
school	1
years	0

wonderful	1
they're	0
just	0
wonderful	1

uh-huh	0

real	1
people	1
and	0
they're	1
interesting	1
and	0
they	1
they	0
have	1
all	1
their	1
own	0
activities	1

and	1
um	1
i	1
think	1
as	0
parents	1
we	1
really	1
enjoy	1
them_1	0
and	0
in	1
our	0
own	1
personal	1
situation	1
our	0
children	1
have	0
not	1
yet	0
decided	0
to	0
rebel	1

uh-huh	0
so	1
they're	0
pretty	0
good	0
kids	1
huh	0

i'm	0
su[re]	0
i'm	0
sure	1
that's	1
coming	1
though	1
but	0
they're	1
wonderful	1
kids	1

yeah	0

well	1
we	1
had	0
ni[ne]	0
well	0
growing	1
up	1

talk	0
about	0
us	1
uh	0

had	0
nine	1
kids	0
in	0
our	0
family	0
we	0
had	0
eight	0

i	0
mean	1
there	0
are	1
some	0
real	0
issues	1
here	1

i	1
think	1
um	0

uh-huh	0

i	1
don't	1
know	0
it's	0
an	1
interesting	1
phenomena	1
i	0
happen	1
to	0
um	0
i'm	0
a	0
pediatrician	1

oh	0

my	0
husband	1
is	0
a	0
physician	1
so	0
um	0
i	0
i	1
teasingly	1
i	0
talk	0
to	0
parents	0
about	0
this	0
a	0
lot	1
uh	0
children	1
i	0
i	0
think	1
working	1
mothers	0
or	0
mothers	1
who	0
choose	1
to	0
work	0
outside	1
the	0
home	1
um	0
need	1
very	1
early	1
to	1
come	1
to	0
grips	1
with	1
any	0
guilt	1
that	0
they	1
feel	1
and	0
decide	1
what's	0
best	1
for	0
them	1
and	0
their	0
family	1

yeah	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
i	1
feel	1
when	1
my	0
children	0
were	1
very	1
young	1
i	0
had	1
jobs	1
that	1
helped	1
me	1
be	1
flexible	1
with	0
my	0
schedule	0
and	1
spend	0
time	1
with	1
them	0
and	0
all	1
that	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	0
and	0
i	1
long	1
ago	0
decided	0
i'm	0
a	0
better	0
mother	1
because	0
i	0
work	1
outside	0
the	0
home	1
i	0

um-hum	0

i	0
really	1
believe	1
that	0
and	0
it	0
has	0
um	0
helped	1
us	0
to	0
afford	1
some	0
things	1
for	0
our	1
children	0
that	0
we	1
couldn't	0
otherwise	1
that	1
i	0
think	1
are	0
wonderful	1
particularly	0
at	1
this	0
age	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
our	0
kids	0
are	0
real	1
secure	1
and	1
have	0
a	1
real	1
sense	1
of	1
priorities	1
and	0
that	0
they	1
can	0
do	0
anything	1
and	0
be	0
anything	1
both	1
male	1
and	0
female	0
a	0
lot	1

um-hum	0

so	0
i	1
know	1
it	1
sounds	1
like	0
a	0
rationalization	1
but	1
it's	0
i	1
really	0
think	1
it's	0
true	1
for	0
our	1
family	0
and	0

well	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
has	0
worked	1
very	0
well	1

yeah	0
it's	0
like	0
you	0
said	0
it's	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
each	1
his	0
own	1
i	0
mean	1
we're	0
planning	0
on	0
having	0
my	1
wife	0
stay	0
home	0
and	0
but	0

there's	1
no	0
question	1
i	0
think	0
that's	0
really	1
the	0
best	1
if	0
if	1
a	0
woman	1
is	0
happy	1
doing	0
that	0

um-hum	0

i	0
hate	1
to	0
put	0
it	0
quite	1
that	0
way	1

yeah	0

i	0
was	0
twenty	1
nine	0
when	0
i	0
had	0
my	0
first	1
child	0
and	0
um	0
i	1
would	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
real	1
fulfilled	1
i	0
really	1
would	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
totally	1
staying	0
home	1
with	0
a	0
young	0
child	1
it's	0

um-hum	0

it's	0
a	0
wonderful	1
it's	0
wonderful	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
mother	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
liked	0
i	0
like	0
the	0
way	1
i	0
did	0
it	0

right	1

i	1
sort	0
of	0
worked	0
half	1
time	0
i	0
had	0
very	1
flexible	0
hours	1
i	0
nursed	0
all	1
three	0
of	0
our	0
children	0
till	0
they	0
were	0
at	0
least	1
a	0
year	1
and	0
i	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
that	0
despite	1
working	0
very	1
easily	0
which	0
is	0
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
i	0
preach	1
all	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
to	0
mothers	1

oh	0

uh-huh	0

um	0
and	0
i	0
think	1
we	0
choose	1
very	1
very	0
carefully	1
the	0
um	0
alternative	0
situations	1
that	0
we	0
had	1
them	0
in	0

um-hum	0

some	0
babysitting	1
groups	0
again	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
rationalization	1
but	0
i	0
really	0
do	1
think	0
sometimes	0
they	0
very	1
early	0
on	0
are	0
around	0
lots	1
of	0
other	0
children	0
and	0
they	0
they	0
learn	1
to	0
share	1
and	0
they	0
learn	1
not	0
necessarily	1
to	0
be	0
the	0
center	0
of	0
attention	1
but	0
that	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	0
we	1
have	0
to	0
be	0
sure	1
they're	0
secure	1

um-hum	0

i	0
think	0
that	0
helps	1

well	0
that's	0
good	1
sounds	0
like	0
you're	0
have	0
a	0
handle	1
on	0
it	0

oh	0
yeah	0
hope	0
so	1
so	0
your	0
wife	1
does	0
she	0
work	1
right	0
now	1

um	0
no	1
not	0
right	0
now	1
right	0

she's	0
out	0

right	0
right	0
well	0
we	1
just	0
moved	1
down	0
here	0
we	1
used	0
to	0
live	0
up	0
in	0
seattle	1
f[or]	0
for	0
a	0
couple	1
years	0

you're	0
still	0
trying	1
to	0
dry	0
out	1

it's	0
it's	0
no	0
problem	1
here	1
yeah	0
we	1
really	0
liked	1
it	0
up	0
there	0
but	0
then	1
when	0

well	1
anyway	1
i	1
uh	1
i	1
uh	1
oh	1
i	1
i	1
did	1
forget	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
name	1
by	1
the	0
way	1

um	1
i'm	1
ann	1

oh	1
you're	1
ann	1
hi	1
but	1
um	1
anyway	1
i	1
uh	1
lot	1
of	1
lot	1
of	1
s[tuff]	1
interesting	1
procedural	1
things	1
i	0
think	1
we	1
could	1
we	1
could	1
change	1
if	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
talking	1
about	0
the	1
subject	1
to[night]	0
tonight	1
which	1
is	1
some	1
i	1
guess	1
criminal	1
courts	1
the	1

criminal	1
courts	1
yes	1

yeah	1
the	1
the	0
one	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
uh	1
something	1
something	1
that's	1
been	0
going	1
on	1
because	0
of	1
the	0
rodney	1
king	1
trial	1
here	0
in	0
town	1
and	0
that	1
is	0
uh	0
and	0
that	1
is	1
the	0
exclusion	1
of	1
jurors	1
because	1
of	0
or	0
in	1
spite	1
of	0
their	1
race	1
uh	1
ye[ah]	1

oh	1
really	1

yeah	1
well	1
the	1
the	1
uh	1
the	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
the	0
the	0
the	1
uh	1
the	1
jury	1
that's	1
trying	1
uh	0
the	0
officers	1
in	0
that	1
case	1
is	1
is	1
an	0
all	1
white	1
panel	1

right	1

and	1
there's	1
been	0
a	0
lot	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
local	1
papers	1
of	0
that	0
fact	1

how	0
is	1
it	0

i	0
can't	1
i'm	1
a	0
little	0
surprised	1
they	0
didn't	0
get	1
a	0
change	1
of	0
venue	1
on	0
that	1
one	1

they	1
have	1
they	0
have	1
they	1
moved	1
it	0
up	1
to	1
the	1
county	1
north	1
of	0
here	1

oh	1

um	1
it's	0
in	1
ventura	1
and	1
there's	0
there's	0
still	1
quite	1
a	0
bit	1
of	0
publicity	1
obviously	1
and	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
debatable	1
whether	1
you	0
could	0
get	0
a	0
fair	1
trial	1
almost	0
anywhere	1
because	0
that	1
uh	0
that	1

well	0
that	0
videotape	1
was	0
just	0
horrible	1

yeah	1
it	1
was	1
everywhere	1

yeah	1

so	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
i	1
i	1
think	0
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
someone	0
uh	1
find	1
a	1
panel	1
that	0
would	1
be	0
not	1
have	1
seen	1
it	0
and	0
and	0
known	1
of	0
what	1
was	0
going	0
on	0

oh	0
i	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
but	0
i	0
can't	1
imagine	1
that	0
they	0
would	0
do	1
an	0
all	1
white	1
jury	1
without	1
having	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
of	1
discrimination	1
or	1
or	1
you	0
know	1
uh	0
appeal	1
on	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
jury	1
of	1
his	0
peers	1
and	0
all	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
stuff	1

exactly	1
you	1
know	1
um	0
the	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i'm	1
kind	0
of	0
torn	1
on	0
this	0
issue	1
it's	0
like	1
they're	0
saying	1
well	1
on	1
the	0
one	1
hand	0
they're	0
not	1
he's	1
not	0
getting	0
a	0
jury	1
of	0
his	0
peers	1
which	1
is	1
in	0
some	1
ways	1
i	1
think	1
true	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
is	1
it's	1
also	1
saying	0
that	1
white	1
jurors	1
are	1
not	1
going	0
to	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
convict	1

right	1

uh	1
you	1
know	0
they're	1
not	1
going	1
to	0
do	0
their	1
job	1
which	1
is	0
the	0
whole	1
the	1
whole	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
on	1
a	1
jury	0
is	1
to	0
convict	1
or	1
or	1
or	0
uh	1
let	1
go	0
based	1
on	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	0
evidence	1
says	1
that	0
there's	0
enough	0

exactly	1

based	1
on	0
fact	1
right	1

how	1
interesting	1
ooh	1
so	1
what's	1
the	0
prevailing	1
thought	1
within	1
the	0
community	1

um	1

i	1
mean	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
the	1
news	1
media's	0
gonna	0
make	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
what	1
about	1
the	0
community	1

they	1
well	1
i	0
guess	1
it	0
depends	1
on	0
who	1
you	0
talk	0
to	0
i	1
haven't	0
talked	1
to	0
uh	0
i	0
haven't	1
talked	1
to	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	1
of	0
black	1
people	0
on	0
it	0
but	0
i	0
i	0
rather	1
imagine	1
there's	1
there's	1
some	1
snickering	1
about	1
it	0
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
the	0
usually	1
fatalistic	1
oh	0
here	1
we	0
go	0
again	1
folks	1
kind	0
of	1
stuff	1

uh-huh	1

oh	1
my	1
goodness	1
that	1
can't	1
be	0
good	1
for	0
los	1
angeles	1
either	1

no	1
no	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
on	1
on	0
on	1
one	1
hand	1
y[ou]	0
on	1
the	0
one	1
hand	1
you	0
almost	1
hope	1
that	1
they	1
convict	1
them	1
because	1
it's	0
th[ey]	1
they	0
have	1
that	1
very	1
strong	1
piece	1
of	0
physical	1
evidence	1
showing	1
these	1
people	0
beating	1
the	1
heck	1
out	0
of	1
this	1
guy	1
um	0

oh	0
exactly	1

unfortunately	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
is	0
not	1
limited	1
to	1
uh	0
a	0
big	0
city	1
like	0
los	0
angeles	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
just	1
about	1
anywhere	1

um-hum	0

there	1

well	0

but	1
that's	0
that's	0
interesting	1

yeah	0
um	0

what	1
about	1
the	0
judge	1
who's	0
hearing	1
the	1
case	1
is	0
he	1
gonna	0
be	0
impartial	1
is	0
he	1
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
g[ood]	0
a	0
good	1
adjudicator	1

i	1
don't	0
know	1
you	1
know	0
and	1
and	0
again	1
there's	0
something	1
else	1
th[at]	0

they	1
can	1
be	1
deceiving	1
to	1
people	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
work	1
there	1
long	1
because	1
i	1
couldn't	1
handle	1
the	1
the	1
treatment	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
got	1
and	0
this	1
is	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	1
a	0
very	1
well-known	0
center	1
here	0
in	0
tyler	1
who	0
had	0
two	1
or	0
three	1
um	0
centers	1
all	1
over	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
um	1
city	1
and	1

um-hum	0

and	1
they	1
would	1
um	0
be	0
one	1
way	1
when	0
the	0
parents	1
were	0
there	1
and	0
be	1
another	1
way	1
when	0
the	1
parents	0
left	1

yeah	1

so	1
um	1
i	0
think	1
you	1
need	1
to	0
make	1
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
do	1
do	1
day	1
care	1
centers	1
you	1
know	1
you	0
should	1
make	0
frequent	1
checks	1
and	1
um	0
to	1
check	0
in	1
on	0
them_1	0
when	0
they're	1
not	0
expecting	1
it	1

because	0
they	1
do	1
do	0
things	0
differently	1
when	1
you're	1
not	0
around	1
so	1

well	0
that	0
i	0
know	0
wh[at]	1
the	0
things	1
that	0
we	1
kind	0
of	0
looked	0
at	0
is	0
is	0
you	0
wanna	1
see	0
how	1
many	1
teachers	1
you	1
have	1
and	0
and	0
how	1
many	0
kids	1
they	0
have	0
and	0
how	1
they	0
break	0
it	0
up	1

um-hum	0

right	1

because	1
we	1
had	0
we	1
had	0
one	0
that	0
sounds	1
kind	1
of	0
like	0
what	0
you	1
were	0
in	1

um-hum	1

it	0
it	0
was	1
a	1
really	1
good	1
one	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
it	0
worked	0
out	1
for	0
us	1
because_1	1
my	1
wife	1
we	1
kind	0
of	0
bartered	1
my	1
wife	1
did	1
artwork	1
for	1
them_1	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
know	1
so	0
we	1
got	1
our	1
uh	0
day	1
care	1
free	1

um-hum	0

but	1
they	1
didn't	0
have	0
enough	1
teachers	1
and	1

well	0
this	1
one	1
was	1
set	1
up	1
good	1
i	1
mean	1
they	1
had	1
two	1
teachers	1
to	1
every	1
room	1
um	1
sometimes	1
three	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
system	1
like	1
so	1
when	1
you	1
walked	1
in	1
everything	1
looks	0
cool	1

um-hum	1

the	0
problem	0
i	1
had	0
was	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
show	0
affection	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
enough	0
they	1
did	1
not	1
show	0
them	1
care	1
to	0
these	1
small	1
children	1
who	0
are	0
being	0
left	1

um-hum	0

um	1
they	1
one	1
time	0
i	1
picked	0
up	1
this	1
little	1
boy	1
who	0
was	1
crying	1
and	0
the	1
owner	1
came	1
and	1
just	1
chewed	1
me	1
up	0
one	1
side	1
and	1
down	0
the	1
other	0
you	0
know	1
he	0

hm	0

he	0
said	0
you	1
are	0
gonna	0
have	0
every	1
child	0
in	0
here	0
wanting	0
you	0
to	0
pick	0
them_1	0
up	1

and	0
i	1
said	0
no	1
this	1
child	0
was	1
crying	1
and	0
needed	0
some	1
comfort	1
you	0
know	1
what	1

yeah	1

what	1
is	0
your	1
problem	0
so	1
um	1

did	1
did	1
they	1
separate	1
them_1	0
by	1
age	1
group	1

yes	1

because_1	0
i'd	1
think	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
think	1
that's	1
one	0
thing	0
that	0
was	1
important	1

right	1
they	0
did	1
they	0
had	1
like	0
um	0
the	0
the	0
crawlers	1
the	0
babies	1
that	0
didn't	1
walk	1
in	0
one	1
room	1
the	0
ones	1
that	0
were	0
starting	1
to	1
walk	0
in	0
one	1
room	1

uh-huh	0

then	0
they	0
had	1
like	1
the	0
um	0
three	1
three	1
year	0
olds	1
upper	1
fours	1
lower	1
fours	1
upper	0
fives	1
lower	0
fives	1
you	1
know	0
just	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	1

you	1
know	0
they	0
really	1
did	0
separate	1
them_1	0
well	0

it	0
it	0
sound	1
yeah	1

it	0
was	0
just	1
the	0
teachers	1
themselves	1

it	0
sounds	1
like	0
to	0
me	1
your	1
your	1
concern	1
would	1
be	0
to	1
make	0
sure	1
that	1
they	0
are	1
loving	1
people	0
affectionate	1
people	0
that	1
they're	1
they're	0
kind	1
of	0
par[ents]	0
maybe	0
parents	1
themselves	1
or	0
something	1

right	1

but	1
yeah	1
that	1
they're	1
not	1

yeah	1
their	0
system	1

right	1
but	1
their	1
but	0
their	1
system	1
was	0
was	1
great	1
but	1
um	0
the	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
caring	1
just	0
wasn't	1
there	1

um-hum	0

the	0
one	1
woman	1
that	0
taught	1
that	0
did	1
the	0
babies	1
i	0
worked	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
was	0
fabulous	1

um-hum	0

she	1
loved	1
them	1
babies	1
and	0
she	1
loved	1
them_1	0
and	1
cared	1
for	1
them_1	0
but	1
um	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
that	1
i	0
saw	1
was	1
just	1
screaming	1
and	0
yelling	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
would	0
make	1
me	1
a	0
nervous	0
wreck	1
so	0
you	1
know	0

yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
think	0
that's	0
probably	0
a	0
really	1
important	0
thing	1
because	0
you	1
can	0
have	0
doctorates	1
and	0
phd's	1
and	0
all	0
that	1
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0
you	1
know	0
know	1
all	0
the	0
technical	1
stuff	1
but	0
if	0
they	0
don't	0
reach	0
out	1
and	0
touch	0
the	0
kids	1
then	1
that	1
doesn't	1
do	0
any	1
good	1

yeah	0
these	0
kids	1
are	0
just	0
in	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0
all	0
day	1
and	1
uh	0
with	0
no	1
any	0
type	0
of	0
emotional	1
you	0
know	1
getting	1
love	1
getting	0
care	1
they're	0

yeah	1

they're	0
just	1
there	1
you	0
know	1
going	1
through	0
this	0
routine	1
which	0
is	0
lousy	1

yeah	1

an[d]	0

the	1
other	1
the	1
other	1
group	1
that	0
we	1
had	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
interesting	1
the	1
other	1
one	0
we	1
went	1
to	0
the	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
husband	1
and	0
wife	1
team	0

um-hum	0

and	0
we	1
knew	0
them	0
from	0
other	0
associations	1
but	0
uh	1
it	0
was	0
kind	1
of	1
interesting	1
because	0
she	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
the	1
strict	1
one	0
and	0
i	1
think	1
you	1
know	0
she	1
would	0
she'd	1
put	0
her	0
arm	1
around	0
the	0
kids	0
and	0
talk	1
to	0
them_1	1
and	1
stuff	1
you	0
know	1
but	0
he	1
was	0
actually	0
the	1
more	1
um	0
the	0
more	1
uh	1
what	0
demonstrative	1
type	1
the	0
more	0
loving	1
he	1

um-hum	0

he	1
would	0
you	1
know	0
laugh	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	0
play	1
with	0
the	0
kids	1
and	1
and	1
it	0
it	0
it	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
interesting	1
to	0
see	0
that	0
that	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
actually	1
the	0
man	1
in	0
the	0
group	1
that	0
that	0
did	1
that	0
side	1
of	0
it	1

uh-huh	1

an[d]	1

yeah	1
you	0
don't	1
see	1
that	0
much	1

yeah	1
so	0
they	1
had	1
a	0
really	1
nice	0
balance	1
we	1
liked	1
that	0
one	0
in	1
fact	1
it	0
was	0
called	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
play	1
school	0
or	0
something	1
but	0

that's	0
cute	1

but	0
they	0
also	1
did	1
they	0
also	1
did	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
teaching	1
things	1
and	0
then	0
they	0
had	1
um	0
you	0
know	1
obedience	1
obedience	1
was	0
important	1

yeah	1
that	0
has	1
to	0
be	1
with	0
a	0
day	1
care	0
center	0

and	1
you	1
know	0
so	0
they	1
u[sed]	0
you	0
know	1
they	0
used	1
uh	0
oh	0
i	0
think	1
they	0
used	1
the	0
you	0
probably	0
heard	1
where	0
you	1
know	1
where	0
you	0
stand	1
in	0
front	1
of	1
the	0
clock	1
and	0
get	1
your	0
power	1
back	1
to	0
control	1
yourself	1

i've	0
never	1
heard	1
of	0
that	1
that's	1
that's	1
a	1
new	1
one	0
on	0
me	1

and	0
it's	0
it's	0
it's	0
one	1

uh	0
i	1
can't	0
remember	1
what	1
they	0
call	0
it	0
exactly	1
but	0
y[ou]	0
you	0
just	0
stand	1
them_1	0
in	1
front	0
of	1
the	0
clock	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
has	0
a	1
second	1
hand	1
that	0
goes	1
around	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
they	1
have	0
to	0
stand	1
there	0

um	1
what's	1
our	1
topic	1

taxes	1
do	1

do	1
we	1

much	1

right	1
um	1

well	1

we	1

what	1
do	0
you	1
do	1

um	0

i	1
guess	1

i	1

really	1
on	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
bracket	1
you're	1

bracket	0
is	1

i	1
pay	1
the	1
i	1
generally	1
pay	0
the	0
maximum	1
tax	1
bracket	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
uh	1
i	1
think	0
that	0
we're	1
paying	0
too	1
much	1
because	1
i	1
don't	1
have	0
any	0
children	1

right	1

and	1
i	1
pay	1
a	0
lot	1
on	1

taxes	0

um	1
sure	1

i	1
don't	1
have	1
any	1
um	0
i	1
don't	1
you	1
know	1
i	0
don't	1
use	1
an	0
awful	1

to	0
work	1
but	1
uh	0
i	0
have	1
to	1

who	1
wanted	1
a	0
bit	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
money	1
or	1
the	1
state	1
money	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
is	1
and	1

um-hum	0

and	1
i	1
just	1
sometimes	1
many	1
times	1
i	1
end	1
up	1
feeling	1
like	0
i'm	1
paying	1
too	1

though	1

it	0
comes	0
from	1
trees	1
how	0
can	1
it	0
be	0
bad	1

it	0
is	1
because_1	0
they	0

they	0
treat	1
it	0
with	0
chemicals	1
or	1
something	1
why	1
can't	0
trees	1

down	1
i	0
don't	0
get	1
it	0

well	1
they	0
do	1
treat	0
paper	1
with	0
chemicals	1
like	1
yellow	1
paper	1
you	1

takes	1
something	0
like	1

times	0
as	0
long	1
to	0
decompose	1

from	0
the	0
banks	1
of	0
the	0
nile	1

i'm	0
sure	1
that's	0
fine	0

i'm	0
sure	1

maybe	1
we	0
ought	0
to	0
just	0
start	1
carving	0
in	0
stone	1
again	0

you	0
think	0
so	1

maybe	1

tablets	1

yeah	1

i	0
think	1
we	0
should	0
just	0
abandon	1
the	0
you	1
know	0
the	0
written	1
word	1
altogether	1
no	1
what	1

you	0
think	1

i	0
don't	0
know	1
well	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
think	0
we've	0
kind	0
of	0
you	1
know	0
i	0

what	1
do	0
you	0
think	1

i	0
mean	0
everybody	1
[every]body	0
if	0
everybody	1
had	1
a	0
computer	1

kind	0
of	0
radical	1
i	0
know	1
but	0

we	0
would	0
no	1
longer	0
need	1
paper	1
at	0
all	1

that's	0
true	1

everyone	1
had	0
a	0
two-way	1
wrist	1
watch	0
tv's	0
on	0
their	0
wrist	1
like	0
uh	0
dick	1
tracy	0

i	1
would	0
love	1
that	0

okay	1
so	1
what	1
kind	1
of	0
experience	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
you	1
have	1
then	1
with	1
child	1
care	1

i	1
guess	1
i	0
think	1
um	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
that	1
worked	1

does	1
it	1
say	1
something	1

i	1
think	1
it	1
usually	1
does	1
you	1
might	1
try	1
um	1
i	1
don't	1
know	1
hold	1
it	1
down	1
a	0
little	1
longer	1
okay	1

okay	1
well	1
does	0
it	0
usually	1
make	0
a	0
recording	1
or	0
s[omething]	0

okay	1
i	0
well	0
i	1
don't	1
remember	1
it	1

it	1
seemed	1
like	0
it	0
did	1
but	0
it	1
might	1
not	1
i	1
guess	1
i	0
guess	1
we	1
can	1
start	1
um	1

okay	1

okay	1

no	1
i	1
don't	1
i	1
don't	1
have	1
any	1
kids	1
i	1
um	1
my	1
sister	1
has	0
a	0
she	1
just	1
had	1
a	1
baby	1
he's	1
about	1
five	1
months	1
old	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
worrying	1
about	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
work	1
and	0
what	1
she	1
was	0
gonna	0
do	1
with	0
him	1
and	0
the	0
different	1

um-hum	1

do	1
you	1
have	1
kids	1

i	1
have	0
three	1

oh	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
i	0
do	1
yes	1
um	1
i	1
don't	0
work	1
though	1
but	1
i	0
used	1
to	0
work	1
and	1
when	0
i	0
had	0
two	1
children	0

um-hum	0

i	1
work	0
off	1
and	0
on	1
just	0
temporarily	1
and	0
usually	1
find	0
friends	1
to	0
babysit	1
but	1
i	1
don't	1
envy	1
anybody	1
who's	0
in	1
that	0
situation	1
to	0
find	1
day	1
care	1

yeah	1

but	1
does	0
your	1
sister	1
live	0
in	0
a	0
big	1
community	1

um	1
yeah	1
she	0
lives	1
it's	1
a	1
it's	1
a	1
fairly	1
large	1
community	1
she	1
um	0
got	0
real	1
lucky	1
though	1
she	1
had	0
a	0
boss	1
who	0
um	0
moved	1
into	0
a	0
larger	0
office	1

um-hum	1

and	0
she's	1
able	1
to	1
take	0
her	1
baby	0
to	0
work	0
with	1
her	0

oh	1
really	1

and	1
it's	1
a	0
small	1
office	1
that	0
she	0
works	1
in	0

um-hum	0

and	0
um	0
it's	0
a	0
it's	1
a	0
legal	1
firm	1
office	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
one	1
lawyer	1

um	0

and	0
so	0
she's	1
the	0
only	1
one	1
really	1
that	0
takes	1
care	0
of	0
the	0
office	1
there's	0
no	1
one	1
else	0
that	0
works	1
there	1

um-hum	0

and	1
so	1
they	1
have	0
an	0
extra	0
room	1
and	1
everything	1
for	0
the	1
baby	1
so	0
it	0
works	1
out	0
pretty	0
good	1
for	0
her	1

wow	1

how	0
lucky	1
i	0
i	0
know	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	0
around	0
here	1
sometimes	0
have	1
like	0
mothers	1
or	0
grandmothers	1
that	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
their	0
kids	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
but	0
the	0
community	1
i'm	1
in	0
is	0
not	1
a	0
real	1
large	1
one	1
so	0
there	1
are	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
people	1
who	1
babysit	1
in	0
their	1
home	1
that	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
either	0
know	1
them	0
or	0
know	0
somebody	1
who	0
knows	1
them	0
to	0
get	1
to	0

yeah	1
so	0
it's	0
fairly	1
safe	1

yeah	1
to	1
get	0
references	1
and	0
that	1
so	1
but	1
um	0
i	1
i	0
do[n't]	0
don't	1
feel	0
comfortable	1
about	0
leaving	1
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
big	0
day	1
care	0
center	1
but	0
simply	1
because_1	1
there's	0
so	1
many	0
kids	1
and	1
so	1
many	0

worried	1
that	1
they're	0
not	1
going	1
to	0
get	1
enough	0
attention	1

yeah	1
and	0
um	0
you	1
know	0
colds	1
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	1
get	1
spread	1
real	0
easy	1
and	1
things	1

yeah	1

but	0
and	0
they're	1
expensive	1
and	0
course	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
different	0
types	1
of	0
day	1
care	1
available	1
too	1
you	1
know	1
where	0
they	0
teach	1
them	1
academic	1
things	0

yes	1

or	1
they	0
just	1
watch	1
them	1
and	0
let	1
them_1	0
play	1
and	0
things	1
like	1
that	1
but	0
take	0
a	1
long	0
time	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
right	0
place	1

yeah	1
and	0
you	0
and	0
you	0
don't	1
always	0
even	0
know	1
if	0
it's	0
it's	0
gonna	1
be	1
the	1
right	1
place	1
or	1
not	1

um-hum	0

anything	1
i	0
guess	1
could	0
happen	1

um-hum	0

because	0
after	1
i	1
guess	1
after	1
he	0
you	1
know	1
gets	1
to	0
a	0
certain	1
age	1
she's	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
to	0
take	0
him	1
to	0
a	0
day	1
care	0

um-hum	1
when	0
he	0
starts	0
toddling	1
around	1
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

when	0
when	0
he's	0
not	1
when	0
she	0
can't	1
keep	1
control	1
of	0
him	0
and	1
he	1
starts	1
crawling	1
that's	0

um-hum	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
hard	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
kind	0
of	0
stressful	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
nice	1
to	0
have	0
him	0
around	1

um-hum	1

but	1
um	0
seems	1
like	0
you	1
know	0
go[lly]	1
what	0
if	0
he	0
cried	1
at	0
the	0
wrong	1
time	0
or	1
the	0
phone	1
rang	1
or	0
you	1
know	0
at	0
the	0
wrong	1
time	1

yeah	1

but	1

i	0
think	1
she	0
has	0
problems	1
with	1
that	1
too	1

um-hum	0
well	1
when	0
you	1
have	0
kids	1
will	0
you	1
work	1
do	0
you	0
work	1
now	1

i	1
don't	1
know	0
that's	1

that's	1
something	1
i've	0
considered	1
um	1

um-hum	0

i	1
always	1
kind	0
of	1
think	1
it	1
would	0
be	1
neat	1
to	0
be	1
able	0
to	1
watch	1
them_1	0
and	0
be	1
there	0
for	0
them_1	0
all	1
the	0
time	1

um-hum	0

is	0
that	1
what	0
you	0
do	1

um	0
yeah	1
uh	0
actually	1
i	0
teach	1
my	0
kids	1
at	0
home	1
so	0
i'm	1
here	0
all	1
the	0
time	0

oh	1
so	0
they	1
don't	0
go	0
to	0
school	1
is	0
it	0
like	0
um	0
oh	1
what's	1
that	0
called	1
it's	0
a	0
correspondence	1
school	1
they	0
do	0
it	0
at	0
home	1

uh-huh	0

yeah	1
yeah	1

that's	1
interesting	1

so	1

do	0
you	1
have	1
to	0
have	1
any	0
special	0
training	1

not	1
it	1
depends	1
on	1
the	0
state	1
you	0
live	1
actually	1
some	0
laws	1
absolutely	1
prohibit	1
it	0
some	1
states	1
um	0
say	0
that	0
you	0

in	0
order	0
to	0

that	0
our	1

and	0
i'm	1
not	0
a	0

i	0
went	0

only	0
elementary	1

at	0
all	1

one	1
of	0

a	0

of	0

and	1
so	1
you	1
know	0
my	0
oldest	1
he	1
was	1
and	0
then	0
my	0
youngest	0
two	1

in	1
the	0
saginaw	1

saginaw	1

um-hum	1
and	0
i'm	0
not	1
real	1
familiar	1
with	1
uh	0
anything	1
that	0
i	0
i[n]	1
fact	1
the	0
far	0
as	1
i	1
know	0
the	0
school	1
doesn't	0
have	1
any	1
kind	0
of	0

in	1
this	1
area	1

really	1

yeah	1

the	1
rec[ycling]	0
we	1
live	1
in	1
plano	1
and	1
they	1
started	0
off	1
recycling	1
by	0
um	1
putting	1
the	1
i	0
think	0
at	1
each	0
wal-mart	1
they	0
had	1
some	0
recycling	1
dumpsters	1
and	1
things	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
i[t]	0
now	1
i	1
guess	1
the	1
uh	0
city	1
h[as]	0
has	0
bought	1
these	0
big	1
green	1
trash	1
cans	1
and	1
uh	1
we	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
recycling	1
truck	1
that	1
comes	1
around	1
now	1
and	1
you	0
separate	1
your	1
glass	1
and	1
paper	1
and	0
uh	1
aluminum	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
you	1
set	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
they	1
pick	1
it	0
up	1
and	1
i[t]	1
it	1
works	1
real	1
neat	1
they	1
seem	1
to	0
be	1
having	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
response	1

really	1

but	0

that	1
is	1
pretty	1
good	1
i'm	1
we're	1
originally	1
from	1
another	1
state	1
and	0
i	0
know	1
in	0
the	1
state	0
we	0
were	0
from	1
that	1
they	0
did	1
that	1
ty[pe]	1
similar	1
type	0
thing	0
the	1
city	1
brought	0
out	1
you	1
know	1
se[parate]	1
tra[sh]	1
separate	1
trash	1
cans	1
and	1
you	1
separated	1
your	1
stuff	1
and	0
you	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
there	1
and	0
they	1
took	1
it	0
you	1
know	1

did	0
they	1
did	0
they	1
like	1
on	1
bottles	1
did	0
they	1
give	1
you	1
a	0
so	1
many	1
cents	1
back	1
for	1
for	0
cans	1
even	1

i	1
don't	0
really	1
know	1

even	1
i've	1
seen	1

i	1
don't	1
really	1
know	1
they	1
they	1
started	1
after	1
we	1
moved	1
down	1
here	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
i'm	1
not	1
really	0
familiar	1
i	0

seen	1
that	0

i	0
just	1
know	1
that	1
and	1
my	0
in-laws	1
up	0
in	1
up	1
in	0
oklahoma	1
that's	0
how	0
they	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
they	0
pick	1
it	0
up	1
but	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
if	1
they	1
get	1
a	0
get	0
anything	0
back	1
on	1
it	0
or	0
do	0
you	1
get	0
money	1
for	0
it	0

no	1
i've	0
just	1
i	0
noticed	1
in	1
iowa	1
and	0
other	0
cities	1
like	0
that	1
it's	0
a	0
nickel	1
per	1
aluminum	0
can	1

oh	1

so	0
you	0
don't	1
see	1
too	1
many	0
thrown	1
out	1
around	1
the	1
streets	1
even	0
bottles	1

really	1

you	1
know	0
all	0
kinds	1
of	1
bottles	1
they	1
they	1
they	1
really	1
charge	1
people	1
to	0
uh	1
i	0
guess	0
when	0
you	1
purchase	1
them_1	0
and	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you	1
turn	1
them_1	0
back	0
in	1

right	1

i	0
know	0
i	1
remember	1
the	0
old	1
days	1
as	0
a	1
kid	1
where	1
a	1
bottle	1
was	0
a	1
nickel	1
an[d]	0

right	1
and	0
now	1
now	1
most	1
of	0
them_1	1
are	1
th[e]	1
throwaway	1

right	1

so	1
maybe	1
that's	0
one	1
thing	0
they	1
could	0
do	1

i	1
think	0
now	1
they're	0
a	1
lot	0
more	0
expensive	1
than	0
that	1
um	0
i	1
bought	1
some	0
cokes	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
in	0
the	1
br[ead]	1
the	1
little	0
bottles	1
you	1
know	1

um-hum	0

and	1
i	0
think	1
the	1
bottles	1
were	1
like	0
i	1
know	1
they	1
were	0
at	1
least	1
ten	1
cents	0
apiece	1
i	1
was	1
trying	1
to	0
figure	1
out	0
how	0
i	0
was	1
like	0
god	1
how	1
much	0
were	0
those	1
bottles	0
you	0
know	0

well	0
that's	1

and	0
it	1
was	0
they	0
come	1
in	0
like	0
uh	0
eight	0
an[d]	0
and	1
eight	1
and	0
ten	1
packs	0
you	0
know	1
instead	0
of	0
six	1
packs	0

right	1

and	0
uh	1
and	0
they	1
were	1
like	0
it	0
was	1
like	1
two	1
dollars	1
and	0
something	0
for	1
the	0
bottles	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
was	0
like	0
god	1
almighty	1
costs	1
more	0
for	0
the	0
bottles	1
than	0
it	0
did	0
for	1
the	0
cokes	1

that	1
was	0
my	0
brother's	1
first	0
job	1
in	1
a	1
grocery	1
store	1
he	1
was	1
in	0
the	1
bottle	1
area	0

we're	0
gonna	1
bump	1
our	1
heads	1

it's	0
pretty	0
dangerous	1
out	1
there	0
you	1
know	0
when	0
they	0
fall	1
over	1
but	0
but	1
it's	1
uh	0
it's	0
quite	1

right	1

they	0
say	1
that	0
the	0
green	1
glass	0
now	1
that	0
there's	0
a	1
big	1
glut	1
of	1
green	1
wi[th]	0
the	0
green	1
glass	0
yeah	1

oh	0
really	1

of	0
green	1
glass	1

yeah	1
it's	0
amazing	1

uh	0
we[ll]	0
out	1
in	0
this	1
area	0
they	1
really	0
don't	0
have	1
anything	0
now	0
i	1
know	0
that	0
like	1
minyard's	1
and	0
places	1
like	0
that	1
around	0
like	1
arlington	1
and	1
fort	1
worth	1
and	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
those	1
grocery	1
stores	0
they	1
have	1
like	1
four	1
different	1
bins	1
out	0
front	1
yeah	0
different	0
colors	1
for	0
different	0
things	1
and	0
and	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

right	1

but	0
i	0
i	1
did	1
know	0
some	1
of	0
these	0
places	0
were	0
doing	1
that	0
and	0
they	0
discontinued	1
them_1	0
because	1
people	1
coming	0
and	0
dumping	0
their	0
trash	1
in	0
them_1	0

right	1

yeah	1

sort	1
of	0
faded	1
away	1
the	0
milk	1
jugs	1

yeah	1

it	0
it's	0
people	1
just	0
they	1
they	0
really	1
don't	1
uh	0
there's	0
too	1
much	0
labor	1
involved	0
i	0
guess	1
to	0
separate	1
the	0
stuff	0

yeah	1
more	1
than	0
it's	0
worth	1

it's	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
it	1
it	1
can	0
be	0
it's	0
not	1
as	1
easy	1
collecting	1

say	1

right	1
righ[t]	1
well	0
who	1
wants	0
to	0
clean	0
their	0
junk	1
before	0
they	0
throw	1
it	0
away	0

that's	1
right	1
that's	0
right	1
it's	0
like	0
washing	1
the	0
dishes	1
before	0
you	0

um-hum	1

i'm	1
happy	1
with	0
their	1
school	1
it's	1
great	1
good	0
teachers	1
good	0
curriculum	1
um	1
they	1
learn	1
a	1
lot	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
problems	1
um	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
better	1
and	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	0
the	1
city	1
though	1
i	1
live	1
in	1
you	1
know	0
the	1
real	1
richy	1
part	1
i	1
guess	1
i'm	1
not	1
but	1

but	1
everybody	1
around	1
me	1
is	1
and	1
um	1
but	1
the	1
i	1
have	1
friends	1
that	1
live	1
in	1
the	0
other	1
the	1
less	1
fortunate	1
or	0
whatever	0
you	0
wanna	1
call	1
it	0
part	0
of	1
town	1
and	1
their	1
schools	1
are	0
kind	1
of	1
rundown	1
and	1
um	1
older	1
and	0
they	1
don't	1
really	1
offer	1
as	0
much	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
as	1
uh	1
the	0
school	0
that	1
my	1
girls	0
are	1
in	1
i	0
don't	1
really	0
think	0
that's	1
fair	1
you	0
know	1

um-hum	1

um	0
but	1
you	1
know	1
i'm	1
happy	1
with	0
what	1
they're	0
in	1
so	0
go	0
ahead	1

well	1
yeah	1
it	1
it's	0
it's	1
pretty	1
much	0
what	0
i	1
was	0
going	0
to	0
say	1
is	1
there's	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
disparity	1
between	0
different	1
neighborhoods	1
and	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
schools	1
go	0
in	1

um-hum	1

um	0
i	1
grew	1
up	0
in	1
new	0
york	1
and	1
um	1
the	1
place	1
or	1

wow	1

or	1
not	1
new	1
york	1
city	1
upstate	1
new	1
york	1

um-hum	1

and	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
uh	1
the	0
city	1
of	1
rochester	1
school	1
district	1

um-hum	1

and	1
s[o]	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
my	1
friends	1
were	0
in	1
one	1
of	0
the	1
neighboring	1
suburbs	1
and	1
it	1
wasn't	1
we	1
weren't	1
too	1
far	0
removed	1
geographically	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
but	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
schools	1
i	1
think	0
was	1
pretty	0
substantial	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
things	0
that	1
probably	1
would	1
have	0
been	0
better	1
if	0
is	1
if	0
the	1
entire	1
county	1
had	0
had	1
had	1
just	1
one	1
school	1
system	0

right	1

and	0
that	1
would	0
result	1
in	0
some	0
um	0
could	1
result	0
in	0
more	0
equitable	1
distribution	1
of	1
money	1
because	0
what	0
was	0
happening	1
was	1
you	1
know	1
all	0
the	0
very	0
rich	1
people	0
went	0
out	1
to	0
the	1
move	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
suburbs	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
a	0
very	1
low	1
tax	1
base	1
so	1
they	1
didn't	1
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	0
money	1
to	1
work	1
with	0

uh-huh	1

as	1
a	1
result	0
the	0
schools	1
were	1
rundown	1
there	0
wasn't	1
as	0
many	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
nice	1
supplies	1
in	1
science	1
class	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
there	1
wasn't	1
as	1
many	1
advanced	1
placement	1
courses	1
uh	1
when	0
i	1
was	0
a	1
senior	1
as	0
some	1
other	0
schools	0
had	1

um-hum	1

and	1
uh	0
it	0
it	1
so	1
i	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
think	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	0
things	1
one	1
of	0
the	0
ways	1
to	1
to	1
to	0
help	1
schools	1
in	0
general	1
uh	0
and	0
get	1
them	0
all	1
to	0
a	1
minimum	0
level	1
of	0
of	0
of	0
competency	1
almost	1
would	0
be	1
to	0
expand	1
the	0
size	1
of	1
school	1
districts	1
so	1
you	1
get	1
a	1
wider	1
variety	1
of	0
people	1
and	1
the	0
the	1
problem	1
with	0
that	1
is	0
then	1
then	1
then	0
people	1
will	1
either	1
the	1
rich	1
people	0
will	0
either	0
pull	1
their	0
kids	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
public	1
school	0
and	0
put	0
them	0
in	0
private	1
schools	0
or	1
they'll	0
move	1
farther	1
away	1
to	1
get	1
better	0
schools	1
so	1

yeah	1

right	1

so	1
you	1
know	1
it	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	1
you	1
end	0
up	0
chasing	1
like	0
a	0
dog	1
chasing	0
its	1
own	0
tail	1
sort	0
of	0

also	1
um	0
the	0
the	0
family	1
environment	1
you	1
know	0
you	0
can	0
come	1
to	0
south	0
tyler	1
where	0
i	0
live	1
and	0
you	1
have	0
got	0
room	1
mothers	0
in	0
every	0
room	1
you've	0
got	0
art	1
mothers	0
you've	0
got	0
every	1
every	1
holiday	1
there's	1
parties	1
all	1
the	1
kids	1
have	0
these	0
really	0
supportive	1
really	1
supportive	0
parents	1
always	1
up	0
there	0
for	0
something	1

yeah	1

you	1
can	0
go	1
to	0
north	0

right	0

right	1

they	0
have	0
no	1

so	0
they	1
just	0
go	0
to	0
school	1
and	0
you	0

eh	0
you	1
know	1
i'll	0
get	1
through	0
the	1
day	1
and	0
um	1
bring	0
homework	1
home	1
and	0
there's	1
nobody	0
to	0
to	0
sit	0
them	0
down	1
and	0
say	0
you're	1
going	1
to	0
do	1
this	1

right	0

um	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
they	1
they	0
take	1
a	0
notion	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
they	0
do	1
and	0
um	1
that	1
doesn't	1
work	1
either	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
have	1
to	0
have	1
guidance	1
and	0
um	1
they	1
can't	1
just	1
have	1
it	0
at	1
school	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
home	1
and	1

um-hum	0

and	1
there's	0
nothing	1
you	1
know	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
yeah	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
a	0
big	0
factor	1
for	1
me	1
i	0
ended	1
up	0
coming	1
out	1
of	0
of	0
the	0
public	1
school	1
system	0
very	1
well	1
you	1
know	1
with	0
very	1
good	1
education	1
i	1
ended	1

uh-huh	0

ended	1
up	1
getting	1
some	0
scholarships	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
college	1
and	1
which	0
has	1
been	1
you	1
know	0
which	0
is	0
really	1
nice	1
and	0

um-hum	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
the	0
difference	1
for	0
me	1
was	1
that	0
my	1
parents	1
were	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
were	0
definitely	1
they	1
were	1
always	1
there	1
was	1

yeah	1

was	1
like	1
well	0
yeah	1
of	1
course	1
you're	1
going	1
to	1
study	1
and	1
do	1
well	1
i	0
mean	0
that's	0
the	1
way	1
of	0
course	1
are	1
you	1
know	0

do	1
you	1
know	1
anyone	1
that	1
uh	1
has	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
or	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
one	1

no	1
but	1
i	1
my	1
grandparents	1
were	1
looking	1
into	1
it	1
before	1
so	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
they've	1
said	1

uh-huh	1

um-hum	1

well	1
i'm	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
my	1
uh	1
uh	1
wife's	1
grandmother	1
had	1
alzheimer's	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
and	1
uh	1
they	1
when	1
they	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
she	1
had	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
the	1
nursing	1
home	1
made	1
them	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
her	0
back	1
because	0
she	1
was	1
being	1
a	1
a	1
you	1
know	1
a	1
a	1
nuisance	1
or	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
nuisance	1
i	0
mean	1
sh[e]	0
she	1
sort	1
of	0
went	0
you	1
know	1
bananas	1
and	1

oh	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
was	0
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
bother	1

and	1
they	1
couldn't	1
couldn't	1
deal	1
with	0
her	1
so	1
i	1
guess	1
you	1
need	1
to	1
uh	1
know	1
whether	1
it's	1
a	1
you	1
know	1
no	1
deposit	1
no	0
return	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
whether	1

right	1
if	1
they're	1
equipped	1
too	1
to	1
handle	1
the	0
kind	1
of	1
patients	1
you're	1
gonna	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
put	0
in	1
there	1
too	1

yeah	1

because	1
i	0
know	1
my	0
grandparents	1
wanted	1
to	0
have	1
some	1
independence	1
still	1

right	1

they	0
wanted	1
someplace	1
they	1
can	1
go	1
and	1
have	0
their	1
meals	1
and	1
a	1
nurse	1
on	1
staff	1
just	1
in	1
case	1
they	1
needed	1
her	1
but	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
independent	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
their	0
own	1
room	1

right	1

my	0
grandmother	1
actually	1
was	0
in	0
a	1
a	1
nursing	1
home	1
that	0
um	1
there	1
was	1
a	0
retirement	1
hotel	1
and	0
then	0
a	1
uh	1
there	0
was	0
some	1
sort	1
of	0
full-time	1
care	1
place	1
that	0
was	0
also	1
associated	1
with	0
it	1
so	1
for	1
um	0
the	1
first	1
few	1
years	1
she	0
had	1
her	1
own	1
apartment	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
made	1
her	1
own	1
meals	1
sometimes	1
but	1
could	1
could	0
also	1
go	1
and	1
eat	1
someplace	1
else	1

um-hum	1

and	0
then	1
um	0
as	1
she	0
became	1
less	1
able	0
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
herself	0
then	1
she	1
moved	1
into	0
this	1
other	1
part	1
that	0
was	1
able	1
to	0
um	1
provide	1
full-time	1
care	1
and	1
um	0
she	1
didn't	1
have	1
to	1
do	0
anything	1
anymore	1
but	0
my	1
experience	0
has	0
been	0
that	0
most	1
people	1
that	0
move	1
into	1
nursing	1
homes	1
die	1
very	1
quickly	1
and	1
that's	1
some	0
i	1
don't	1
know	0
whether	0
that's	1
because	1
they	1
you	0
know	1
sort	0
of	1
give	1
up	0
hope	1
once	0
they	0
get	1
in	1
there	1
or	0
what	1
the	1
what	1
the	1
reason	1
is	1
but	1
i	1
think	0
the	1
average	1
length	1
of	0
time	1
that	0
somebody	0
lives	1
in	0
a	1
nursing	1
home	0
is	1
only	1
like	1
six	1
months	1
or	1
something	0

well	1
a	1
lot	0
of	1
that's	1
probably	0
to	0
do	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	0
people	1
go	1
to	1
it	1
because	1
they	1
need	1
help	1

yeah	1

they	1
need	1
health	0
care	1
so	0
they're	1
already	1
ill	1
before	0
they	0
go	1

right	1

that's	1
probably	1
a	1
large	0
factor	1

yeah	1
if	0
if	0
you	1
can	0
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself	0
at	0
all	1
or	0
have	1
someone	1
that	0
can	1
take	0
care	1
of	0
you	0
then	1
you	0
stay	1
where	0
you	1
are	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
only	0
go	1
there	0
as	0
a	0
last	0
resort	1

um-hum	1

or	1
people	1
send	1
you	0
there	0
as	1
a	1
last	0
resort	1

right	1
right	1
that's	1
my	1
grandparents	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
so	0
that	1
the	1
rest	1
of	0
the	1
relatives	1
would	1
have	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
knowing	1
that	1
if	0
anything	1
happened	1
there	1
was	1
somebody	0
there	1
for	1
them	0

uh-huh	1

so	0
that	1
was	0
their	1
thinking	0
somebody	1
who	0
would	1
know	1
what	1
to	0
do	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	0
an	1
emergency	1

right	0

and	0
also	1
so	0
they	0
could	1
find	1
someplace	1
they	0
enjoyed	1
while	0
they	0
still	1
had	1
choices	1
to	0
make	1
so	0
they	0
wouldn't	1
be	0
stuck	1
going	0
into	0
just	0
whatever	1
nursing	1
home	0
was	0
available	1
at	1
the	1
time	1

right	0

i	0
guess	0
that's	1
a	0
problem	0
too	1
for	1
people	0
wait	1
lists	1
and	0
all	1

yeah	0
i	0
guess	1

that	1
um	1
you	1
can't	1
always	1
get	1
in	1
when	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
and	1
of	0
course	1
you	0
can't	1
just	0
sit	1
around	0
and	1
wait	1

right	1
when	0
you	0
need	1
it	0
you	0
need	1
it	0
i	1
guess	1

yeah	1

and	0
the	0
money	1
is	0
also	1
another	0
issue	1
how	1
you're	1
gonna	0
pay	1
for	1
it	0

right	1

at	1
that	1
stage	0
of	1
life	1
you	0
only	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
money	1
left	1
and	1
i	0
guess	1
it's	0
not	0
exactly	1
fair	1
for	0
the	0
younger	1
family	1
members	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
put	0
in	0
their	1
savings	0

yeah	1

i	0
mean	0
it	0
is	1
kind	0
of	0
fair	1
but	0
it's	1
also	0
not	1
fair	0
because	1
they	0
have	1
their	0
own	1
children	1
to	1
raise	1

sure	1

so	0
that's	1
another	0
problem	1

and	1
you	0
probably	1
if	1
it	1
were	0
you	1
you	1
probably	1
wouldn't	1
want	1
someone	0
choosing	1
a	0
place	1
for	0
you	0
to	0
live	1
based	1
on	0
lowest	0
price	1

right	1
right	1
so	1
it's	1
it's	1
just	0
so	1
complicated	0
anymore	1
i	0
think	0
people	1
outlive	1
their	0
savings	1
and	1
with	0
medicine	1
being	1
the	0
way	1
it	0
is	0
you're	0
extending	1
life	1
where	0
sometimes	1
the	0
quality	1
of	0
living	1
has	0
gone	1
down	1
and	0
they're	0
not	1
necessarily	1
enjoying	1
life	0
anymore	1

yeah	1
well	1
maybe	1
that's	1
the	0
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
nursing	1
home	1
is	0
to	1
have	0
them	0
go	1
someplace	1
where	0
they	0
can	0
see	1
that	0
it's	0
not	1
worth	0
continuing	1

it's	1
just	1
a	0
shame	1
that's	1
the	0
way	0
it	1
has	0
to	0
be	1
i	1
think	1
the	0
retirement	1
home	0
idea's	0
a	0
nice	1
idea	0
to	0
go	1
and	0
find	1
older	1
people	1
and	0
with	0
similar	1
interests	1
and	0
someplace	1
to	0
stay	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
because_1	1
uh	0
like	0
if	1
your	0
spouse	1
died	1
all	0
of	1
a	0
sudden	1
you	1
be	1
all	0
alone	1
it'd	0
be	0
nice	1
to	0
go	1
someplace	0
people	1
similar	1
to	0
you	1
and	0
have	1
friends	1

right	1

i	0
i've	0
known	1
quite	0
a	0
few	1
people	0
that	0
have	0
um	0
gone	1
to	0
retirement	1
communities	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
if	0
they	0
have	1
them	0
back	1
there	0
but	0
here	1
in	0
california	1
and	0
in	0
ariz[ona]	0

you	1
wanna	1
go	1
first	1

no	1
you	1
can	1
start	1

okay	1
um	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
they	1
talked	1
about	1
was	1
uh	1
did	1
we	1
di[d]	1
wha[t]	1
do	1
what	1
do	1
we	1
think	1
about	1
a	0
judge	1
making	0
the	1
decision	1

um-hum	1

and	1
i	1
really	1
don't	1
agree	1
with	1
that	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
is	0
better	1
uh	1
you	1
know	1
than	1
e[ven]	1
having	1
a	1
unanimous	1
decision	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
have	0
one	1
person	1
be	0
responsible	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
objective	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
every	1
time	1

right	1

y[ou]	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
i	1
mean	1

right	1
there's	1
there	1
th[is]	0
thi[s]	1
this	1
topic	1
is	1
kind	0
of	1
moot	1
um	1
there	1

yeah	1

there	1
there's	0
no	1
way	1
we	1
we	1
couldn't	1
survive	1
in	1
a	1
sy[stem]	1
in	1
a	1
in	1
a	1
juror	1
syst[em]	0
in	1
a	1
trial	1
system	1
without	1
a	1
jury	1

right	1

um	1
one	1
man	0
can	1
never	1
be	1
one	1
man	1
one	1
woman	1
can	1
never	1
be	0
objectionable	1
in	1
every	1
case	1

that's	0
it	1

um	1
every	1
person	1
has	1
their	1
opinions	1
and	1
that's	1
why	1
jury	1
selection	1
is	1
often	1
very	1
difficult	1
um	1

well	0
i	1
i	0
feel	1
the	0
other	1
thing	0
too	1
uh	0
they	1
were	1
saying	1
uh	1
you	1
know	0
what	1
new	1
ways	1
could	1
you	1
could	1
it	1
you	1
you	1
know	0
change	1
the	0
system	1
i	1
i	0
really	1
think	1
that	1
um	1
we	1
spend	1
a	0
lot	1
of	1
time	1
uh	1
going	1
through	1
appeal	1
after	1
appeal	1
after	1
appeal	1
after	0
appeal	1
i	1

i	1
mean	1
i[f]	1
if	0
you	1
go	1
to	0
a	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
and	0
especially	1
if	0
a	0
person	1
has	1
confessed	1
if	0
they	1
have	1
been	1
caught	1
you	1
know	1
point	1
blank	1
in	1
the	1
crime	1
there's	1
uh	1
no	1
question	1
it's	1

right	1

it's	1
beyond	1
a	1
reasonable	1
doubt	1
you	0
all	1
these	0
things	1
i	1
mean	0
you	1
know	1
we've	1
gone	1
through	0
this	1
uh	0
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	0

right	1
they	1
shouldn't	1
allow	1
an	1
appeal	1

and	1
it	1
can	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
ten	1
twenty	1
years	1

yep	1

i	1
i	1
think	1
this	1
is	0
a	1
little	1
ridiculous	1

um-hum	1

i	0
think	1
the	1
only	1
people	1
who	1
benefit	1
from	1
that	1
are	1
the	0
lawyers	1

no	1
that's	0
right	1
i	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
law	1
firm	1
i	1
ought	0

i	1
i'm	0
serious	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
that	1
the	0
lawyers	1
have	0
caused	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
the	1
problems	1
tha[t]	1
ha[ppen]	1
that	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
in	1
the	0
criminal	1
system	0
today	1
with	1
plea	1
bargaining	1

right	1

you	1
know	0
if	1
someone	1
is	1

well	1
plea	1
bar[gaining]	1
plea	1
bargaining	1
is	1
a	0
different	0
story	1

well	1

plea	1
bargaining	1
is	0
something	0
completely	1
different	1
that	1
that	1
actually	0
prevents	1

well	1
i	0
know	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	1
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
all	1
of	0
the	0
whole	0
criminal	1
system	1
is	0
messed	1
up	1
in	1
in	1
that	1
regard	1
i	1
mean	1
you	1
know	1
people	1
who	1
commit	1
uh	0
crimes	1
that	0
they	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
how	1
it	1
works	1
exactly	1
but	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	0
lesser	1
sentences	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
understand	0
that	0
the	0
jails	1
are	0
full	0
of	0
people	1
you	1
know	1
uh	1
and	0
that	0
they	1
have	1
to	0
do	1
something	1

right	1

but	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
the	0
reason	1
they	0
are	1
full	0
is	0
because	1
they	0
know	1
that	0
they	1
can	1
get	1
away	1
with	0
it	0

hum	1

you	0
you	1
know	0
what	1
i'm	1
saying	1
tha[t]	0
we	1
we	1
don't	0
have	1
um	1
well	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
states	0
don't	1
have	0
capital	0
punishment	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
i	1
think	1
they	1
should	1

we	1
do	1

i	0
and	0
i	1
think	0
if	0
a	1
person	1
is	0
guilty	1
of	0
taking	1
someone's	0
life	1
and	0
like	0
you	0
say	1
it's	0
it's	0
there's	0
no	1
doubt	1
whatsoever	0
like	0
drunk	0
drivers	1
that	0
kill	1
people	1
and	1
um	0
you	1
know	0
all	1

right	1

they	0
they're	0
caught	1
dead	0
to	0
rights	1
i	0
i	1
just	0
think	1
that	0
that's	1
they've	0
they've	1
taken	1
a	0
life	1
and	0
if	1
they	1
should	0
pay	1
for	0
it	0
with	0
their	1
life	1

right	1
when	1
you're	0
saying	1
as	0
as	0
far	1
as	1
the	0
appeal	1
um	1
procedure	1
is	0
concerned	1

yeah	1

we	1
just	0
have	0
the	0
case	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	1
you've	0
probably	0
heard	1
of	0
marion	1
berry	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
his	1
fi[nal]	1
his	0
last	1
appeal	1
was	1
was	0
denied	1
two	1
days	0
before	1
his	0
sentence	1
was	0
up	1

oh	0
really	1

so	1
i	1
mean	1
his	0
appeal	1
was	1
denied	1
and	1
two	1
days	1
later	1
he	1
got	0
out	1
of	1
jail	1
for	1
cocaine	1
possession	1

it	1
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
um	1
that	1
was	1
absurd	1
there	0
was	1
no	0
there	1
was	0
no	1
reason	0
the	1
appeal	1
process	0
should	0
have	1
dragged	1
on	0
that	0
long	1
for	1
a	0
six	1
month	0
sentence	1

i	1
know	0
that	1
the	1

uh-huh	1
an[d]	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
uh	0
wha[t]	0
what	1
would	0
you	1
do	0
to	1
change	1
it	1
to	0
make	1
it	0
better	1

well	1
uh	0
the	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	0
can	1
i	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
the	1
the	0
appeal	1
procedure	1
is	0
the	0
only	1
thing	0
i	1
can	1
possibly	0
think	1
of	0
um	1
i	0
like	1
i	0
said	0
as	0
far	1
as	0
removing	1
of	0
the	0
jury	1
and	0
having	1
the	0
judge	1
sentence	0
that's	1
absurd	1
there's	1
no	0
way	1
that	1
could	0
work	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
i	1
i	1
don't	0
agree	1
with	0
that	0
at	0
all	1

um	1
but	1

imagine	1
the	0
guilt	1
that	1
person	1
would	0
have	1
i	0
mean	1
it	1
burned	1
out	1

oh	1
exactly	1

is	1
there's	1
no	1
possible	1
way	1
that	0
you	1
could	1
um	0
you	1
know	1
feel	0
good	1
about	1
yourself	1

exactly	1

right	1

if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
do	0
something	1
like	0
that	1
day	1
after	0
day	1

no	1
one	0
would	0
want	1
the	1
job	1

no	1
rea[lly]	1
not	1
really	1

um	1
and	1
you	1
know	0
like	0
i	1
said	1
the	1
you	0
know	1
everyone	1
has	0
their	1
opinions	1
about	1
every	0
case	1

well	0
wou[ld]	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
people	1
should	0
have	1
a	1
trial	1
if	1
they're	0
caught	1
dead	1
to	0
rights	1
like	1

oh	1
yeah	0
i	0
i	0
feel	1
that	0
everyone	1
is	0
everyone	1
is	0
um	1
entitled	1
to	0
a	0
trial	1
by	0
jury	1
that	1
that	1
that	0
right	1
sh[ould]	0

i	1
mean	1
supposing	1
i	1
come	1
up	0
to	0
you	1
and	0
i	0
just	0
point	1
blank	1
kill	1
you	0

well	1
i	0
mean	1
were	0
there	0
witnesses	1

in	0
other	1
words	1
you're	0
saying	1
that	0
we	1
you	0
have	1
to	0
find	1
out	1
whether	1
it's	0
premeditated	1
or	1
what	1
the	0
circumstances	1
were	1

right	1

right	1
that	0
you	0
can't	1
you	0
can't	1
remove	0
the	0
jury	1
regardless	1
of	0
the	0
case	1

yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
fifty	1
people	1
in	0
audience	1
watching	1
a	0
murder	1
take	0
place	1
and	1

yeah	1

and	1
you	1
you'd	0
still	1
there's	0
still	1
mitigating	0
circumstances	1

well	0
it's	0
i	1
i	1
feel	0

budgeting	1
activity	1
in	1
our	1
household	1
i	1
has	1
is	1
uh	1
uh	1
kind	1
of	1
an	1
informal	1
kind	1
of	1
situation	1

you	1
know	1
put	1
actually	1
what	1
happens	1
is	1
uh	1
is	1
my	1

your	1
budget	0
situation	0

well	1

my	1
current	1
one	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
successful	1
uh	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
point	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
my	1
husband	1
my	1
ex-husband	1

situation	1
is	0
just	0
a	1
wonderful	1
for	0
budgets	1
isn't	1
it	0

it	1
certainly	1

i	1
didn't	1
send	1
them_1	1
back	1
nothing	1
i	1
just	1
put	1
them	0
away	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
handy	1
to	1
have	1
if	1
i	1
absolutely	1
had	1
to	0
have	1
something	0
i	1
could	0
go	0
use	1

terrible	1
part	0
about	1
it	0
i've	0
looked	1
at	1
it	0
all	1
and	1
it	1
all	1
looks	1
still	1
pretty	1
good	1
to	1
me	1

thirteen	1
years	1
old	0

it	1
might	0
go	0
for	0
another	1
thirteen	1
but	0
uh	0
too	1
late	1
we'll	1
never	1
find	0
that	1
out	0

this	0
is	1
so	1
funny	1
that's	1
wonderful	0
but	1
you're	0
lucky	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
because	0
if	0
you're	1
like	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
have	0
difficulty	0
spending	1
money	1
you	1
need	1
somebody	0
to	1
help	1
you	1
spend	0
it	1

and	0

i	1
mean	1
certain	1
things	1
really	1
do	0
need	0
to	1
be	1
done	1
whether	1
or	0
not	1
you	1
think	1
they	1
should	0

or	0
not	1

you	0
know	0
i	1
i	1
i	1
don't	0
spend	0
that	0
much	0
money	0
i	0
just	0
uh	0
we	0
we	1
just	1
sort	0
of	1
have	1
had	1
uh	0
you	1
know	0
too	1
many	1
obligations	1
to	1
you	1
know	1
we	0
sort	1
of	1
take	0
care	1
of	0
the	1
kids	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
school	1
and	1
they	0
they	1

and	1
that	1
was	0
the	0
major	1
you	1

as	0
any	1
formal	1
budgeting	1
uh	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
i	0
we	0

been	0
very	1
fortunate	0
when	0
we	0
went	0
to	0
wanna	0
go	0
out	1
to	0
eat	0
we	0
go	0
out	0
to	1
eat	1
and	0
we	0
never	0
really	1
you	0
know	0
have	0
to	1
program	1
money	0
for	0
that	0
or	1
make	0
choices	1
you	0
know	1
but	0
uh	0
we	1
don't	1
have	1
that	0
uproarious	1
a	0
a	0
lifestyle	1
after	0
all	1
we're	0
we	0

she	1
was	0
gonna	0
get	0
picked	0
up	0
she	1
was	0
gonna	0
pick	0

two	1
blocks	0
away	0
from	0
the	0

up	1
and	0
all	0

kind	0
of	0
stuff	1
and	0

a	0
hundred	1
and	0
four	0
fever	0
they	0
couldn't	1
uh	0
to	0
give	1
him	0
anything	0
because	0
they're	1
not	0
allowed	1
to	0
at	0
school	0
and	0
everything	0

right	1

i	0
was	0
so	1
furious	1
i	0
i	0
quit	1
that	0
job	0
and	0
i	0
stayed	0
home	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
longer	0
then	1
i	0
went	0
and	0
got	1
a	0
um	0
a	0
job	1
in	0
real	1
estate	0
where	0
i	0
can	0
kind	0
of	0
adjust	1
my	0
time	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
better	1

yeah	0
a	0
li[ttle]	0
little	1
bit	0
more	0
flexibility	1
you	0
can	0
come	1
and	0
go	1

yeah	1
but	0
uh	0
i	1
haven't	0
had	0
any	0
good	0
really	0
very	1
good	0
experience	0
with	0
child	1
care	0

yeah	1
well	1
when	0
our	1
kids	0
were	0
small	1
we	0
had	0
a	0
couple	1
of	0
uh	0
good	0
good	0
women	1
who	0
uh	0
would	0
often	1
co[me]	0
uh	0
get	1
them_1	0
to	0
come	1
to	0
the	0
house	1
and	0

uh	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
uh	1
to	1
jury	1
trials	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
i	1
really	1
feel	1
as	1
though	1
uh	1
jury	1
trials	1
are	1
are	1
uh	1
whatever	1
system	1
has	1
been	1
been	1
used	1
historically	1
in	1
particular	1
jurisdiction	1
you	1
know	1
is	1
really	1
the	1
the	1
only	1
kinds	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
use	1
because	1
the	1
the	1
jurisprudence	1
is	1
you	1
know	1
based	1
on	1
on	1
uh	1
you	1
know	1
on	1
accumulated	1
body	1
of	1
law	1
and	1
if	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
situation	1
where	1
you	0
change	1
that	1
body	1
of	1
law	1
then	1
all	0
of	1
sudden	1
they	1
they	1
start	1
they	1
could	1
start	1
going	1
back	1
and	1
digging	1
up	1
all	1
these	0
cases	1
that	0
uh	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
handled	1
differently	1
were	1
they	1
judged	1
by	1
today's	1
standards	1
so	0

um	1

so	0
i	1
i	0
really	1
don't	1
think	1
it	1
th[ey]	0
they	1
can	0
really	1
do	1
much	0
of	1
anything	0
to	1
change	1
it	1
what	0
do	0
you	1
think	1

i	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
so	1
possibly	1
in	1
the	1
jury	1
selection	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
only	1

just	1
for	1
example	1
what	1
we're	1
seeing	1
in	1
california	1
i	1
guess	1
yeah	1
it	1
makes	1
you	1
wonder	1
um	1
had	1
the	1
jury	1
been	0
a	1
different	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
what	1
would've	1
happened	1
with	1
that	1
outcome	1
um	1
and	0
and	1
the	0
problems	1
that	1
that	0
has	0
come	1
that	0
has	0
come	1
from	1
this	1
decision	1
that	0
that	1
jury	0
came	1
to	1
after	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
witnessed	1
what	1
we	1
did	1
with	1
the	1
video	1
tape	1
beating	1
um	1
just	1
makes	0
you	0
wonder	1
i	1
guess	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
they	1

well	1
won't	1
well	1
maybe	1
they	0
used	1
a	0
little	1
bit	0
too	0
much	1
force	1
with	1
stuff	1
like	1
that	1
but	1
then	1
then	1
you	1
know	1
the	0
defense	1
lawyer	1
addressed	1
each	1
and	1
every	0
one	1
of	1
those	0
blows	1
apparently	1

um-hum	0

and	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
other	1
two	0
guys	1
sat	1
in	0
the	0
car	1

that's	1
that	1
um-hum	0

um-hum	0

and	1
they	1
didn't	0
get	1
beat	1
up	1
you	0
know	1
rodney	1

no	1
um-hum	1

rodney	1
got	0
beat	1
up	0
because	1
he	0
he	0
you	0
know	1
he	0
pur[poses]	0
you	1
know	0
he	0
involved	1
himself	1
in	1
some	0
sub	1
self-destructive	1
behavior	1

um-hum	1

and	0
uh	0
um	1
just	1
like	0
the	0
burning	1
and	0
looting	1
is	0
self-destruct	0
everybody	1

gonna	0
rebuild	1
and	0
it'll	0
be	0
even	0
better	1
hey	1
what	1
do	0

that	0
area	1

everybody	1
with	1
that	0
mindset	1
they	1
they're	0

use	1
it	0
for	1
for	0
a	0
bombing	1

site	0

they're	0
only	1

suffer	1
they	0
they've	0
defeated	1
themselves	1
with	0
with	1
their	1
looting	1
and	1
violence	1
um	0
i	1
understand	1
why	1
they	0
were	1
upset	1
by	0
the	1
verdict	1
just	0
because	1
even	1

you	0
see	0
film	1
of	0

in	0
in	0
the	0
street	1

it	1
uh	1
or	0
or	0
beaten	1

and	0
and	0
my	1
reaction	0
is	0
i	1
would've	0
run	0
over	0
fifty	0
people	1
before	0
rather	1
than	0
stop	1
and	0
uh	0
and	0
th[ere]	0
there	1
would've	0
been	0
just	0
uh	0
nothing	0
but	0
carnage	1
after	0
after	0
if	0
i'd	1
been	0
at	0
the	0

right	1

no	1
one	0
would've	0
stopped	1
me	0

right	1

that's	1
that's	1
exactly	0
how	0
i	1
feel	0
too	1
i	1
wouldn't	1
have	0
uh	1
they	0
wouldn't	1
have	0
stopped	0
my	0
car	1
for	0
any	0
anything	1
had	0
i	1
seen	0
them	0
coming	1
but	0
i	1
was	0
just	1
wondering	1
since	0
you	1
were	1
you're	1
in	0
you're	0
back	1
east	1
um	1
and	0
a	0
little	1
closer	0
to	0
the	0
the	0
bigger	1
cities	0
probably	1
than	1
we	1
are	1
in	0
idaho	1
here	1

right	1
i'm	0
inside	1
the	0
beltway	1

oh	0

you	0
know	0
how	0
capital	1
gang	1
they	0
always	0
say	1
well	1
inside	1
the	0
beltway	1
they	0
think	0
thus	1
and	0
so	1
and	0
i	0
say	0
well	0
wait	1
a	0
minute	0
i'm	1
inside	0
the	0
beltway	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
like	0
that	1

um-hum	0

i'm	0
a	0
government	1
employee	1

oh	0
in	1
what	1
uh	1
section	1
of	1
the	0
government	1
do	1
you	0
work	1

i'm	1
with	0
the	0
fbi	1

oh	0
oh	0
that's	1
interesting	1

yes	1
an[d]	0
and	0
so	1
um	0
uh	1
and	0
and	1
the	1
reason	1
i'm	1
doing	1
this	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
know	1
rick	1
who	1
is	0
another	1
government	1
employee	1
wanted	1
a	1
spee[ch]	0
segments	1
of	1
my	0
speech	1
that	0
uh	1
were	0
done	1
a	0
year	1
ago	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
he	0
wanted	1
another	1
collection	1
a	0
year	0
later	1

oh	0

and	0
so	1
this	0
is	1
my	1
seventh	1
call	1
a	0
year	1
ago	1
i	0
did	0
eleven	1
calls	0

oh	1
i	1
see	1

and	0
so	1
that's	1
that's	1
why	0
uh	0
uh	0
tha[t's]	0
that's	1
why	0
i'm	0
religiously	1
getting	0
on	0
the	0
phone	1
because	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
unique	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
have	1
a	0
unique	1
situation	1
here	0
in	1
that	1
if	1
i	0
don't	1
participate	0
