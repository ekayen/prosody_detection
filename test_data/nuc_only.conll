the	0
sauce	0
is	0
just	0
made	1
with	0
um	0
bouillon	1
cubes	1
water	1
burgundy	0
wine	1
and	1
um	0
cornstarch	1
instead	0

not	1
a	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
thick	1
rich	0
type	0
of	0
a	0
sauce	1

more	1
of	0
a	1
when	0

corn	0
starch	1
in	0
in	0
gravy	1
like	0
you	0

any	0
ties	1
or	0
anything	0
because	0
he	0
he	0
just	0
went	0
over	0
there	0
with	0
the	0
that	0
attitude	1
that	0
well	0
if	0

tennis	1
shoes	0
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
she	0
always	1
told	0
me	0
it	0
was	0
because	1
i	0
was	0
still	0
growing	1
and	0
she	0
wasn't	0
going	0
to	0
buy	0
me	0
something	0
i	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
grow	1
out	0
of	0
next	0
week	1

right	1
especially	1
t[o]	0
to	0
pay	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
money	1
for	0
it	0

yeah	1

i	0
have	0
a	0
friend	1
who	1
um	0
she	0
had	1
a	0
she	0
had	1
a	0
ba[by]	0
a	0
little	0
boy	1
and	1
uh	0
sh[e]	0
she	0

neiman	0
marcus	1
i	0
mean	1
she	0
dressed	0
him	1
oh	0
fabulously	1

oh	0

then	1
seems	0
like	1
every	0
time	0
she	0
turned	0
around	1
he	0
was	0
outgrowing	0
stuff	1
and	0

um-hum	1

and	0
she	0
finally	0
learned	1
that	0
you	0
just	0
can	1
not	0
do	1
this	0
you	0
know	0
so	0
now	1
she	0
finds	0
the	0
basement	0
sales	1
and	0
just	0
like	1
you	1
know	0
everybody	0
else	1

that's	0
the	0
best	0
way	0
to	0
shop	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
always	0
thought	0
my	0
mom	0
was	0
being	0
mean	1
to	0
me	0
but	0
i	0
look	0
back	1
at	0
it	0
now	0
and	0
my	1
child	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
i	0
mean	0
i'm	0
going	0
to	0
raise	0
mine	0
the	0
same	0
way	1

right	1

um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0
just	0
ah	0
they're	0
just	0
so	0
outrageously	0
priced	1
it's	0
just	0
incredible	1

yes	1
and	0
your[self]	0

i	0
try	1
to	0
uh	0
always	0
catch	0
the	0
sales	1

right	1

always	1

and	0
yeah	0
and	0
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
keep	0
buying	1
them	0
you	0
know	1
if	0
you	0
if	0
you	0
if	0
you're	0
not	0
buying	0
the	0
most	0
expensive	0
clothes	1
out	0
there	0
the	0
the	0
quality	0
is	0
really	0
not	0
that	0
great	1
you	0
know	0
for	0
the	0
price	0
that	0
you	0
pay	1

yeah	1
it	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
um	1
yeah	0
there's	1
there's	0
always	0
a	0
reason	0
why	1
they're	1
on	0
sale	0

right	1

so	0
that	0
that	0
has	0
a	0
lot	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
it	1

right	0

but	0
um	0
well	1

like	0
i	1
bought	0
i	0
bought	1
the	0
most	0
beautiful	1
sw[eater]	0
uh	0
sweater	1
from	1
uh	0
i	0
believe	0
it	0
was	0
ross	1
dress	0
for	0
less	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
it	0
wa[s]	0
it	0
was	0
really	0
pretty	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
was	0
just	0
plain	1
a	0
plain	1
uh	0
ro[und]	0
you	0
know	0
round	1
uh	0
necked	1
uh	0
sw[eater]	0
sweater	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
it	0
had	1
uh	0
like	0
it	0
was	0
embellished	1
around	1
the	0
the	0
top	1
you	0
know	0
it	0
had	1
uh	0
leather	1
leather	0
designs	1
and	0
um	0
some	1
othe[r]	0
other	0
little	0
things	1
on	1
it	1
and	0
i	1
just	0
thought	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
pretty	1
and	0
i	0
go[t]	0
i	0
got	0
it	0
at	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
price	1
i	0
think	0
maybe	0
it	0
was	0
nine	0
ninety	0
nine	1
or	0
something	0

oh	1
that's	0
great	1

and	1
it	0
was	0
so	0
pretty	1
and	1
after	0
i	0
wore	0
it	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
times	1
i	0
realized	1
why	1
[laughter-it]	0
[laughter-was]	0
why	1
it	0
was	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1

huh	0
oh	1

there	0
was	0
in	0
the	1
middle	0
of	0
the	0
back	1
of	0
it	0
there	1
was	0
it's	0
like	1
there	0
it	0
had	0
been	0
slit	1
and	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
just	0
sewed	0
it	0
back	0
together	1
right	0
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
[laughter-the]	0
the	0
back	1
you	0
know	0
wasn't	0

oh	0
no	1

wasn't	0
a	0
seam	0
or	0
anything	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
that's	0
why	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1
although	0
it's	0
not	1
it's	0
not	0
really	0
noticeable	1
um	0
from	0
the	1
outside	1
but	1
but	1
still	1
it's	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
really	1
not	1
not	0
not	0
a	0
good	1
quality	1

and	0
then	0
i	0
was	0
told	1
by	0
somebody	1
that	0
works	0
for	0
jc	0
penney's	1
that	0
um	0
ross	1
ross	1
is	0
just	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
places	0
that	0
sell[s]	0
sells	1
seconds	1

the	0
defect	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
um	0
they	0
don't	0
really	0
buy	0
the	0
first	0
quality	1
they	0
buy	0
the	0
[laughter-second]	1
and	1
uh	0
places	0
like	0
jc	0
penney's	1
that	0
they'll	0
reject	1
the	0
seconds	0
they'll	0
send	0
them	0
back	1
every	0
time	1
but	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
places	0
like	0
ross	1
dress	0
for	0
less	1
and	0
uh	0
tj	0
max	1

tj	0
max	1
does	0
that	0
yeah	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
we	0
have	0
a	0
tj	0
max	0
over	0
here	1
and	0
um	0

you	1
want	0
to	1
start	1

well	1
i	1
guess	1
i	0
would	0
first	0
identify	0
myself	1
as	1
middle	0
aged	1
and	0
therefore	1
having	0
seen	0
the	0
last	0
generation	1
i	1
guess	0
it	1
puts	1
me	0
in	0
you	1
know	0
gives	0
me	1
a	0
perspective	0
on	0
that	1

yeah	1

yeah	1

um	1
i	1
am	0
quite	1
positive	1
on	0
the	1
things	0
that	0
i	0
have	1
seen	0
happen	1
recently	0
relative	0
to	0
women	0
in	1
both	0
in	0
society	1
and	0
in	0
the	1
work	1
place	0
uh	0
there's	0
no	0
doubt	0
about	0
the	1
fact	1
that	1
when	0
i	1
f[irst]	1
was	0
first	0
graduated	1
from	0
college	1
the	0
impression	0
was	1
that	1
a	1
woman's	0
career	0
would	0
consist	1
of	0
a	0
childbearing	1
years	0
and	0
perhaps	1
a	0
return	0
to	0
the	0
office	1
but	0
not	0
necessarily	1
uh	1
now	0
i	0
think	0
the	1
change	0
that	0
i've	1
seen	0
as	0
much	0
as	1
anything	1
is	1
one	1
where	0
couples	1
uh	1
are	0
more	1
carefully	0
planning	1
their	0
intention	1
on	0
how	1
to	1
sh[are]	1
both	0
share	0
homemaking	1
duties	1
and	0
also	1
how	1
women	1
will	0
uh	0
have	0
their	0
children	1
and	0
then	0
deliberately	1
sort	1
of	0
plan	1
how	1
they	0
go	1
back	0
to	1
the	0
work	1
place	0

i	0

and	0
i	0
guess	0
that's	1
a	0
significant	1
change	1
that	0
of	0
i've	1
both	0
participated	1
in	0
an[d]	0
and	1
noticed	1

i	0
agree	1
um	0
the	0
equality	1
of	1
uh	1
the	0
roles	1
now	1
between	0
the	1
sexes	1
i	0
guess	0
has	0
been	1
dramatically	1
demonstrated	0
with	1
this	0
war	1
especially	0
compared	1
with	0
uh	1
the	1
vietnam	1
war	1
and	0
you	0
see	0
women	1
going	0
off	0
to	0
wars	1
as	0
well	0
as	0
men	1

uh-huh	1

um	1
i	1
have	1
wondered	0
why	1
they	1
allowed	0
or	0
let	1
you	0
know	1
both	0
the	1
father	0
and	0
mother	1
go	1
uh	0
and	1
the	0
children	0
are	0
left	1
without	0
either	0
parent	1
now	1
to	1
me	1
that's	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
drawback	1
but	0
uh	0
i	0
guess	0
it's	1
a	0
price	0
you	0
pay	1
and	1
i	0
also	0
wonder	0
about	0
the	0
children	1
that	0
are	0
being	0
brought	0
up	1
in	1
the	0
uh	0
uh	0
day	1
care	0
centers	1

wonder	0
about	1
them	0
in	0
what	0
way	1

well	1
uh	1
from	0
what	0
i	0
understand	1
there's	0
been	0
studies	1
that	1
uh	0
these	0
children	0
are	1
uh	1
more	0
rebellious	1
uh	1
they	0
term	0
it	0
as	1
more	1
uh	1
creative	1
but	1
uh	0
that	0
they	1
uh	0
are	1
much	0
more	1
contentious	1

uh-huh	1

so	0
i	1
i	0
don't	1
i	0
i	0
guess	1
we'll	0
have	1
to	0
see	1
another	1
generation	1
to	1
see	0
what	1
differences	1
a	0
child	0
being	0
brought	1
up	0
you	1
know	0
in	0
in	1
a	0
kind	0
of	0
a	1
uh	0
community	1
rather	0
than	0
a	0
home	1

uh-huh	1

i	1
have	0
not	1
to	0
be	0
honest	1
had	0
much	1
experience	1
with	0
children	1
in	0
that	0
situation	1
i	1

yeah	1

i	1
i	1
guess	0
one	0
knows	0
one's	1
own	1
story	1
and	0
i	1
know	1
uh	0
in	0
my	0
children's	0
case	1
it	1
was	1
one	0
where	1
uh	0
pretty	0
much	0
up	1
until	1
the	0
older	0
of	0
two	1
was	1
in	1
uh	0
let's	0
see	1
i	1
guess	1
basically	0
starting	0
junior	0
high	1
and	1
the	0
younger	1
was	0
in	0
fifth	0
grade	0
when	1
my	0
wife	0
reentered	0
the	0
work	1
force	0

uh-huh	0

um	1

so	0
they	1

so	0
i	0
guess	1
my	0
experience	1
is	1
is	1
just	0
with	0
what	0
we	1
did	0
and	1
and	0
so	0
they	0
didn't	0
really	0
go	0
through	0
the	1
child	1
care	0
route	0
they	1

yeah	1

they	1
were	0
able	0
to	0
be	0
home	1
together	1
um	0
and	0
we	0
never	0
actually	0
experienced	1
that	0
what	1
in	0
terms	0
of	0
changes	1
relative	0
to	0
women	0
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
and	0
and	0
potential	1
changes	0
over	1
the	0
the	0
next	1
generation	1
or	0
so	0
i	0
guess	0
i	0
anticipate	1
um	0
an	0
increasing	0
equality	1
uh	0
greater	0
presence	0
of	0
women	0
in	0
management	1
roles	0

um-hum	0
uh-huh	1

um	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
whether	1
there	0
will	1
be	1
an	0
increased	1
amount	1
of	0
of	0
surrogacy	1
that	0
we	0
see	1
i	0
just	0
don't	0
know	1

what	0
do	0
you	0
mean	1

um	1
deliberate	0
childbirth	1
by	0
surrogate	0
mother	1

oh	1
yeah	1

sort	0
of	0
rent	0
a	0
mom	0
to	0
be	1
you	1
know	0
not	0
to	0
be	1
crass	1
about	0
it	0
but	1
uh	0
uh	0
whether	0
one	0
might	0
conceive	0
no	0
pun	0
intended	1
of	0
the	0
possibility	0
that	0
there	0
might	1
be	0
a	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
deliberate	1
uh	0
um	0
a	0
professional	1
mother	1
a	0
person	1
for	0
instance	0
that	1

yeah	1

that's	1
strange	1

a	0
nanny	1
sort	1
of	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
i	1
could	0
you	0
know	0
i	1
could	1
envision	0
a	0
society	0
where	0
that	0
would	0
happen	1
and	0
make	0
an	0
interesting	1
uh	0
uh	1
story	1
or	0
whatever	1
i	0

yeah	1

i	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
i	0
have	0
a	1
philosophical	1
problem	1
with	0
that	0
in	1
fact	1
i	0
think	0
it	1
sort	1
of	0
raises	1
nurturing	1
and	0
being	0
a	0
mother	1
to	0
what	0
it	0
ought	1
to	1
be	1
which	0
is	0
a	0
respected	0
profession	1

that's	0
right	1
that's	0
right	1

uh	0
um	0
i	0
i	0
don't	1
have	0
a	0
other	1
than	0
than	0
a	0
reading	1
and	0
and	0
male	0
perspective	1
on	0
on	1
the	0
var[ious]	1
on	0
the	0
biological	0
urges	0
involved	1
relative	0
to	0
being	0
a	0
mother	1
or	0
not	1
uh	0
i	0
know	1
that	0
that	0
my	1
sense	0
is	0
that	1
i	0
have	1
very	1
much	1
an	0
interest	1
and	0
had	0
one	0
in	0
being	0
a	0
parent	1
i	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
i	1
uh	1
felt	0
myself	0
necessarily	0
encumbered	1
with	0
the	0
necessity	0
to	0
have	0
heirs	1

uh-huh	1

uh	1
i	0
don't	0
have	0
boys	1
that	0
doesn't	1
didn't	0
bother	0
me	1
never	0
has	1
vision	1
more	0
women	0
deliberately	1
raising	0
children	1
either	0
in	0
surrogacy	1
or	1
or	0
as	0
a	0
professional	0
nanny	1
nanny	1
as	0
you	1
put	0
it	0
uh	1

yeah	1

maybe	0
we'll	0
see	0
a	0
growth	0
in	0
that	1
where	0
someone	0
makes	0
uh	0
a	0
career	1
out	0
of	0
say	1
taking	0
care	0
of	0
five	0
or	0
six	0
children	1
as	0
opposed	0
to	0
day	0
care	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

it	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
sort	0
of	0
day	1
care	0
but	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
more	0
of	0
a	0
family	0
setting	1

right	1

um	0
i	0
know	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
young	1
people	0
characterized	0
i	0
guess	1
as	0
being	0
half	0
my	0
age	1
so	0
that	0
by	0
definition	1
that	0
means	0
they're	0
young	1
uh	0
that	1
in	0
my	0
work	0
place	1
who	0
are	0
both	0
of	0
them	0
earning	1
rather	0
decent	0
professional	1
salaries	0
who	0
probably	0
would	0
consider	0
paying	1
a	0
woman	1
uh	0
eight	0
or	0
nine	0
or	0
ten	0
thousand	0
dollars	0
a	0
year	1
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
their	0
child	1
i	0

um-hum	1
um-hum	0

to	0
come	1
in	0
and	0
live	0
with	0
them_1	1

i	0
could	0
easily	0
envision	1
that	0
pardon	1

to	0
come	1
in	0
and	0
live	1
with	0
them_1	0

or	0
to	0
put	0
their	0
child	1
into	0
a	0
s[etting]	0
into	0
a	0
home	0
setting	1
where	0
they	1
would	0
you	0
know	1
like	1
they	1
they	0
would	0
get	1
leave	0
at	0
eight	0
in	0
the	0
morning	1
and	1
and	0
drop	0
a	0
two	0
year	0
old	0
off	1
in	0
a	0
home	1
where	0
you	0
knew	0
there	0
were	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
four	0
other	0
kids	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
and	0
you	0
were	0
paying	0
for	0
really	0
high	0
quality	0
care	1

yeah	1

right	1

uh	0
i	0
have	1
acquaintances	0
of	0
mine	1
where	0
i	0
know	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
paying	0
figures	1
on	0
on	0
the	0
order	0
of	0
what	0
i	0
quoted	1
to	0
someone	1
because	0
that's	0
what	0
the	0
experience	0
they	0
want	1
and	0
i	1
would	1
imagine	0
if	0
there	0
are	0
more	1
of	0
people	0
like	0
that	1
with	0
an	0
opportunity	1
that	1
that's	0
a	0
possibility	0
of	0
a	0
change	1
that	0
we	0
could	0
see	0
in	0
the	0
next	0
few	0
years	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
then	0
you	0
might	0
have	0
more	0
control	1
over	0
uh	0
the	0
the	0
morals	1
that	0
they	0
would	0
be	0
taught	1
rather	0
than	1
in	0
like	0
a	0
classroom	0
or	0
a	0
day	0
care	0
center	1

um-hum	0
um-hum	0

i	0
know	0
the	0
day	0
care	0
centers	0
are	0
not	0
cheap	1
either	1
you	1
know	0
they're	1

i	0
haven't	0
ever	0
really	0
looked	1
at	0
them	0
are	0
you	0
aware	0
at	0
all	1
of	0
of	0
what	0
they	0
would	1
what	0
they	0
cost	1

uh	0
well	1
no	1
i	0

i	0
just	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
several	0
single	0
mothers	0
who	1
absolutely	0
can't	0
afford	1
it	0
they	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
with	1
the	0
a	0
single	1
uh	0
wh[at]	0
i	0
mean	0
a	0
babysitter	1
more	1
more	0
or	0
less	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
like	1
about	0
sixty	0
dollars	1
a	0
week	1
for	1
two	1
children	0
if	1
i'm	0
not	0
mistaken	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	0
that	1
whether	1
you're	0
on	0
vacation	1
you	1
know	0
and	0
taking	0
care	1
of	0
the	0
children	1
or	0
if	0
the	0
children	0
are	0
at	0
home	1
at	0
home	1
sick	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
mean	1
that	0
is	0
you	1
know	0
just	1
a	0
a	0
rate	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
pay	1
and	1
uh	1

what	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
envision	1
for	0
the	0
next	0
twenty	0
years	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
women	0
in	0
american	0
society	1

uh	1
i	0
think	1
i	0
really	0
don't	1
have	0
a	0
vision	0

that's	0
okay	1
too	1

[laughter-yeah]	1
i	1
um	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
they	0
will	0
be	0
more	0
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
because	1
uh	0
the	0
door's	0
open	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
it's	0
just	0
human	0
nature	1
to	0
walk	0
through	0
an	0
open	0
door	1
so	1
and	0
i	0
would	0
be	0
glad	0
to	0
see	0
that	1
i	0
hope	0
i	0
don't	0
see	1
a	0
lot	0
more	0
single	0
moms	1
but	1
i	0
it	0
seems	0
in	0
my	0
experience	1
i'm	0
running	0
across	0
single	1
women	0
all	0
the	0
time	1

i'm	1
i'm	0
noticing	0
that	0
too	1
and	0
and	0
i	0
notice	1
the	0
the	1
a	0
terming	1
emerging	0
called	0
solo	1
parents	1
that	0
i	1
am	0
very	1
aware	0
of	0
the	0
number	0
of	0
solo	1
mothers	0
that	1
that	0
i	0
encounter	0
in	0
the	0
work	1
place	0
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
that	1
that	0
is	0
a	0
little	0
troublesome	1
uh	0
because	0
the	0
pressures	1
on	0
them	0
are	1
are	0
rather	1
rather	1
formidable	1

yeah	1
yeah	1

it's	0
awful	1

yeah	1

uh	0
and	0
maybe	0
that's	0
a	0
change	1
we'll	0
see	1
maybe	1
uh	0
p[ossibility]	0
the	0
possibility	1
of	0
of	0
women	1
uh	0
who	0
deliberately	0
say	1
no	1
we'll	0
let	0
the	0
man	1
will	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
the	0
children	1
perhaps	1
in	0
the	0
event	0
of	0
a	0
separation	1
or	0
whatever	1

uh-huh	1

right	1

so	1

well	1
i	0
think	0
we've	0
done	1
it	0

well	1
i	0
think	1
we're	0
about	1
done	0
okay	1

thank	0
you	0
very	0
much	1
it's	0

uh	0
good	0
bye	1

it's	0
been	0
interesting	1

you	0
take	1
care	0

okay	1

bye	1

bye	1

okay	1

so	1
are	0
you	1
a	1
freshwater	1
or	1

mostly	0
freshwater	1
uh	1

freshwater	1

yeah	1
i	1
i	0
used	0
to	0
fish	1
uh	1
when	0
i	1
was	1
real	0
young	1
down	0
in	1
galveston	1
with	0
my	1
parents	1
and	1
i	0
never	0
really	1
got	0
into	0
that	1
too	1
much	1
because	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
get	1
in	1
the	0
boat	1
really	1
to	1
to	0
do	0
anything	1
and	1
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
anybody	0
who	1
had	0
a	0
boat	1
now	1
so	1
i	0
don't	0
fish	0
too	0
much	0
in	1
saltwater	1

um-hum	0
most	0
of	0
my	0
fishing	0
has	0
been	0
in	0
the	0
saltwater	1
huh	0
mostly	0
deep	0
sea	0
fishing	1
for	0
grouper	1
and	0
bottom	0
fish	1

oh	0
really	1

oh	1
neat	1

and	1
uh	0
huh	0
i	0
have	0
caught	1
one	0
or	0
two	1
small	1
sharks	1

oh	1
really	1

and	1
uh	0
yes	1

what'd	0
you	0
do	0
with	1
them	1

put	0
them	0
[laughter-back]	1

you	0
didn't	0
get	1
a	0
big	0
kick	1
out	1
of	0
killing	0
them	0
like	0
some	0
people	0
do	1

no	1
no	0
no	0
i	0
love	0
shark	0
steak	1
but	1
uh	0
the	0
ones	0
i	0
caught	1
were	0
never	1
large	0
enough	0
to	1
uh	0
really	0
do	0
anything	1
uh	0

do	0
they	0
have	0
a	0
limit	0
on	0
sharks	1
i	0
mean	0
is	0
that	0
like	0
a	0
a	1
sport	0
fish	1
can	0
you	1
actually	0
catch	1
those	1
and	1
there's	0
no	0
limit	1

is	0
there	0
a	0
limit	1
i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	1
i	0
know	1
i	1
my	0
home	1
is	0
in	0
uh	1
pensacola	0
florida	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
it's	0
they	0
do	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
shark	0
fishing	1
in	0
that	0
you	1
know	0
in	0
the	0
gulf	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
a	0
certain	0
period	0
of	1
time	0
during	0
the	1
year	1
they	0
have	1
all	0
along	0
the	1
gulf	0
coast	0
from	1
i	0
guess	0
from	0
galveston	1
to	1
mayport	1
they	0
have	1
uh	0
shark	0
tournaments	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
there's	1
part	1
either	0
as	1
part	1
of	0
or	0
separate	0
from	1
the	1
uh	0
bill	0
fishing	0
tournaments	1
they	0
usually	0
have	1
so	1
i	0
have	0
not	0

what	0
they	0
call	1
uh	0
brim	1

sorts	0
of	0
things	1
but	1
nothing	1

i	0
haven't	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
that	0
i	0
could	0
do	0
that	1
that	0
looks	0
awful	0
tiring	1

i've	1
tried	0
it	1
once	1

you	1

yes	1

i	0
could	0
never	0
get	0
the	0
hang	1
of	0
it	0

it	0
looks	0
complicated	1
to	0
me	1
it's	0
a	0
rhythm	0
or	0
[laughter-something]	1

have	0
been	0
something	1

fish	0
mainly	0
for	0

just	0
sitting	0
and	0
watching	1
i	0
get	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
relaxation	1
from	0
it	0

mainly	1
i	0
wanna	1
i	0

uh	0
that	1
i	0

uh	0
when	0
i	0
could	0
go	0
in	1
and	0
go	0
down	1
and	1
actually	1
pick	0
them	0
off	0
the	1
[laughter-bottom]	1

right	1

hand	0
picked	1

[laughter-that's]	1
[laughter-right]	1

the	0
weirdest	0
fishing	0
experience	1
i	0
ever	1
had	1
and	0
uh	0
people	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
are	0
still	0
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
if	0
i	0
really	0
caught	0
what	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
caught	1
we	0
were	0
in	1
uh	0
rockport	1
which	0
is	0
close	0
to	0
corpus	1

um-hum	0

and	0
we	0
had	0
been	0
fishing	0
in	0
a	0
canal	1
they	0
had	0
all	0
these	0
canals	1
up	0
through	0
this	1
one	0
little	0
retirement	1
area	0
and	1
uh	0
we'd	0
been	0
fishing	0
in	0
the	0
canals	1
and	0
all	0
we	0
were	0
catching	0
were	0
catfish	1
and	0
we	0
were	0
pretty	0
bored	0
with	0
that	1
so	0
we	0
thought	1
well	0
maybe	0
there	0
are	0
some	0
crab	0
in	0
here	1
we'll	0
try	0
to	0
catch	0
some	0
crab	1
so	0
i	0
got	0
my	0
chicken	0
neck	1
and	0
all	0
my	0
little	1
net	0
and	0
everything	1
and	0
something	1
i	0
had	0
a	1
rock	1
to	0
weight	0
it	0
down	1
something	0
grabs	1
and	0
just	0
runs	1
with	0
it	0
and	0
of	0
course	0
there's	0
no	0
hook	1
so	1
it	0
can't	0
be	0
a	0
fish	1

um-hum	0

i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	0
it's	0
not	0
a	0
fish	1
right	1
and	1
crab	1
they	0
don't	1
bite	0
like	0
that	1
they	0
don't	0
just	0
run	0
with	0
your	0
food	1
so	1
i	0
netted	1
it	0
and	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
ugliest	0
fish	0
i've	0
ever	0
seen	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
it	0
had	0
real	0
teeth	1
like	0
human	0
teeth	1
and	0
it	0
looked	1
archaic	1
i	1
i	0
had	0
no	1
idea	0
what	0
it	0
was	0
i	0
called	0
my	0
father	1
long	0
distance	1
just	0
to	0
describe	0
the	0
thing	1
and	0
it	0
had	0
the	0
rock	1
in	0
it's	1
mouth	1
it	1
not	0
the	0
chicken	1
but	0
the	0
rock	0
itself	1
is	0
what	0
it	0
had	0
grabbed	1

hm	0

they	0
say	0
it's	0
a	0
dogfish	1
from	0
everything	0
i've	0
described	1
it	0
was	0
brown	1
with	0
these	0
little	0
white	0
dots	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
it	0
made	0
a	0
loud	1
kind	0
of	0
almost	0
a	0
croaking	1
noise	0
like	0
a	0
croaker	0
does	1

uh-huh	0

it	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
strangest	0
thing	1
it	1
oh	1
i'll	0
never	0
get	0
over	0
that	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
i	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
in	0
the	0
water	1
anywhere	0
around	0
salt	1
water	0
because	0
i'm	0
sure	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
fish	1
are	0
there	0

well	1
we	0
used	0
to	1
i	0
guess	1
the	0
weirdest	0
thing	0
i've	0
ever	0
caught	1
is	1
uh	0
in	1
some	0
of	0
the	1
inlets	1
and	0
the	0
rivers	1
around	1
rehoboth	0
delaware	1

um-hum	1

they	0
have	0
a	0
fish	1
that's	0
called	1
an	0
oyster	0
cracker	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
you've	0
ever	0
heard	1
of	0
it	0

i've	0
never	0
heard	0
of	0
that	0
one	1

and	1
it	0
has	0
a	0
huge	1
strong	1
mouth	1
and	0
they	0
actually	1
uh	0
use	0
their	0
teeth	1
to	0
open	1
oysters	1

that's	0
where	0
it	0
gets	0
its	0
name	1
obviously	1
huh	1

um-hum	0
and	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
ugliest	1
fish	1
i	0
have	1
ever	1
seen	0
and	1

and	1
i	0
me[an]	0
and	0
they	0
come	0
in	0
all	0
si[ze]	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
i've	0
caught	0
them	1
from	1
you	1
know	0
three	0
or	0
four	0
inches	1
long	1
up	1
to	0
uh	0

um-hum	0

i	0
guess	0
the	1
la[rgest]	0
largest	0
one	0
i	0
ever	0
caught	1
was	0
probably	0
eight	0
or	0
ten	1
inches	0
long	0
but	0
just	1
huge	1
ugly	0
things	1
just	0
terrible	1

huh	1

can	0
you	0
eat	1
them	0

no	1
no	1

ooh	1
i	1
i	0
don't	0
think	0
i'd	0
want	1
to	0
even	0
if	0
you	0
could	1
if	0
they're	0
that	0
ugly	1
but	1

they	1
just	0
they	0
just	1
look	0
as	0
though	0
you	0
do	0
not	0
want	0
to	0
do	0
anything	0
with	1
them	0

that's	0
like	0
this	0
dogfish	1
it	0
was	1
it	0
scared	0
me	0
to	1
death	1

um-hum	0

it	0
was	0
u[gly]	1
it	0
really	1
it	0
didn't	0
look	0
like	1
it	0
looked	0
like	0
it	0
was	0
something	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
dark	1
ages	0
that	0
just	0
never	0
died	1

well	0
the	0
first	0
time	0
i	0
went	1
uh	0
surf	1
fishing	0
was	0
in	0
and	0
i	0
threw	0
my	0
line	0
out	1
and	1
the	0
first	0
thing	0
i	0
caught	1
was	0
a	0
sand	1
shark	0
which	0
was	0
probably	1
a	0
foot	0
and	0
a	0
half	1
or	1
uh	0
two	0
feet	0
long	1

and	0
scared	0
me	0
to	0
death	1

oh	0

i	0
i	0
had	0
never	1
seen	1
anything	0
and	0
then	1
i	1
was	0
fi[shed]	1
fished	0
for	0
another	0
half	0
hour	0
or	0
forty	0
five	0
minutes	0
caught	1
a	0
few	0
white	0
fish	1
and	0
so	1
forth	0
and	0
then	0
i	1
felt	0
something	1
relatively	0
heavy	1
and	0
i	1
thought	0
oh	1
really	1
here	1
i'm	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
get	1
one	0

and	1
i	0
pulled	1

okay	1
this	0
topic	0
is	1
is	1
russia	0
a	1
threat	1
to	1
our	0
security	1
i	0
think	0
they're	1
more	0
of	0
a	0
threat	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
people	1
at	1
this	0
day	0
and	0
time	1
how	0
do	0
you	0
feel	1
about	1
it	1

well	1
they	1
do	0
have	1
uh	0
a	1
major	1
internal	1
problem	0
everybody	1
wants	0
to	0
defect	1
and	1
i	0
can	0
understand	0
why	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
their	0
biggest	0
problem	0
is	1
just	1
you	0
know	1
obtaining	1
food	0
to	0
live	1
so	1
when	0
you	1
have	0
the	1
basic	0
needs	1
uh	0
being	1
unmet	1
i	0
don't	1
think	0
you	0
think	1
globally	1
as	1
far	1
as	0
you	0
know	1
being	0
a	1
threat	0
to	0
other	0
people	0
in	1
the	1
world	1

so	0
as	0
soon	0
as	0
they	1
get	1
their	1
their	0
own	1
home	1
country	0
taken	1
care	1
of	1
then	0
they'll	1
consider	1
what	0
they	0
can	0
do	0
with	1
the	0
rest	0
of	1
the	0
world	1

i	0
believe	1
communism	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
waning	1
it's	1
uh	1
pretty	0
much	1
on	0
the	0
way	0
out	1
of	0
the	1
door	1
in	1
so	1
far	0
as	1
the	0
strong	0
hold	1
that	0
they	1
used	0
to	0
have	1
and	1
the	0
russian	0
people	1
are	1
all	0
realizing	1
that	0
the	0
communist	0
system	0
does	1
not	1
work	1
to	1
their	1
satisfaction	1
or	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
surviving	0
in	0
this	0
world	1
and	1
their	1
rebellions	1
right	0
now	1
is	0
the	1
result	1
of	1
that	0
i[f]	0
if	1
they	0
can	0
get	0
the	1
army	1
or	0
the	0
military	1
to	0
sway	0
to	0
their	0
side	1
i	0
think	1
that	0
uh	0
it	1
will	0
be	1
on	0
the	0
way	0
out	1
eventually	1

it's	0
just	0
a	0
matter	0
of	0
time	1
because	1
in	0
the	0
baltic	0
states	1
they've	0
already	1
massacred	1
so	0
many	0
people	1
who	0
protested	1
and	1

and	1
that	0
hasn't	0
set	0
too	0
well	0
with	1
their	1
diplomacy	1
for	0
the	1
regarding	1
the	0
uh	0
outcome	0
of	0
their	1
affairs	1
what's	0
your	0
synopsis	1

well	1
i	1
do	1
i	0
do	0
realize	0
that	1
um	0
uh	1
the	0
bush	0
administration	0
isn't	1
too	0
happy	1
with	1
with	0
how	0
they're	0
handling	0
their	0
internal	1
um	0
strife	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
diplomacy	0
is	0
concerned	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
been	0
a	0
good	1
a	0
good	1
uh	0
positive	0
direction	0
for	1
um	0
the	0
soviets	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
yeltsin	0
is	0
concerned	1
you	0
know	1
he	1
was	0
um	0
allowed	0
to	1
what	0
wh[at]	0
in	0
his	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
congress	1
they	0
they	0
gave	0
him	0
more	0
power	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
his	0
republic	0
in	0
russia	0
is	0
concerned	1
which	0
is	1
gives	0
him	0
more	0
power	1
overall	1
which	0
i	0
think	0
is	1
a	0
good	0
sign	1
that	0
there'll	0
be	0
some	1
you	0
know	1
politically	0
speaking	1
you	1
know	0
he's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
more	0
power	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
a	0
step	0
in	0
the	0
right	0
direction	1
i	0
think	0
gorbachev	1
realizes	0
that	0
he's	0
got	1
a	1
a	0
major	1
uh	0
uh	0
power	0
figure	1
you	0
know	1
competing	0
against	0
him	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
gonna	0
be	1
pretty	0
close	0
to	0
his	0
demise	1
if	0
he	0
doesn't	1
follow	0
suit	0
with	0
yeltsin	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
uh	0
realizing	1
well	1
he	0
does	0
realize	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
with	0
the	0
fact	1
that	0
they	0
reduced	1
the	0
uh	0
or	0
they	0
increased	0
the	0
prices	1
on	0
their	0
food	1
food	1
and	0
goods	1

uh-huh	1
i	1

uh	0
it	1
yeah	1

i	1
think	1
that	0
it	1
went	0
up	0
a	0
thousand	1
percent	0
on	0
most	1

yeah	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	0
incredible	1
but	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
um	0
go	0
in	0
the	0
direction	1
of	0
a	0
market	0
driven	0
economy	1
and	1
and	0
they	0
had	0
to	0
bite	0
the	0
bullet	1
for	0
that	0
so	0
that's	0
a	0
good	0
move	1
on	1
on	0
gorbachev's	0
part	1
in	0
doing	0
that	1

um-hum	1

so	1

but	0
gorbachev	0
has	0
still	0
not	0
fully	1
convinced	0
everyone	1
that	0
he's	1
moving	1
towards	0
a	0
two	1
to	1
three	0
party	0
system	1
of	1
government	1
that	0
nor	1
eliminating	1
or	1
diminishing	0
the	0
communist	0
power	1

and	0
i	0
guess	0
that's	0
where	0
yeltsin	0
steps	0
in	1
so	0
far	1
as	0
his	0
politics	1
of	1
government	0
goes	1
uh	0
but	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
how	0
convinced	1
the	0
people	0
are	0
of	1
him	0
yet	0
myself	1

well	1
that's	0
all	0
they	0
got	0
right	0
now	1
that's	0
their	0
ray	0
of	0
hope	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
you	0
know	1
they'll	0
go	0
with	1
you	0
know	1
w[ho]	1
whoever	1
comes	0
through	0
for	0
them	1
i	1

i	1
it	1
it's	0
just	0
that	1
w[hat]	0
the	0
weird	0
thing	0
is	1
is	0
that	0
gorbachev	1
is	0
the	0
one	0
that	0
opened	0
the	0
floodgates	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
with	0
glasnost	1
and	0
[poistroi[ka]-/perestroika]	1
perestroika	1
and	0
stuff	1
and	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
he's	0
caught	0
between	0
the	0
old	0
guard	1
and	1
and	1
the	0
new	1
uh	0
glasnost	1
um	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	1
uh	0
escalate	0
to	0
a	0
point	1
where	0
it's	0
out	0
of	0
control	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
had	0
to	0
pull	0
in	0
the	0
reins	1
the	0
only	0
way	0
he	0
knew	0
how	1
in	0
order	0
to	0
keep	0
the	0
peace	1
on	0
peace	0
on	0
both	0
sides	1
so	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
where	1
you	0
know	1
kind	0
of	0
where	0
he's	0
stuck	1
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1

yeah	1
uh	0
i	0
understand	1
it	0

and	1
that's	0
the	1
that's	0
the	1
situation	1
that	0
he	0
finds	1
himself	0
in	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
he's	0
a	0
tough	0
guy	1
i	0
mean	0
he's	0
been	0
through	1
it	0
so	0
i	0
have	0
no	0
doubt	0
that	0
he'll	1
i	0
mean	1
y[ou]	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
overall	1
he's	1
been	0
a	1
a	0
good	1
ah	0
figure	0
for	1
the	0
the	0
soviet	0
union	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
think	0
his	0
intentions	1
and	0
his	0
ideals	1
are	1
are	1
uh	0
well	0
intentioned	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
in	0
the	0
long-term	1
but	0
i	0
just	0
think	0
that	1
because	0
of	1
the	0
basic	0
needs	0
that	0
the	0
people	1
don't	0
have	1
i	0
think	0
that	1
that	0
makes	0
the	0
problem	1
most	0
severe	1
and	0
makes	0
him	0
look	1
look	0
worse	1
that	0
what	0
his	1
um	0
what	0
his	0
ideals	0
are	1
personally	1

i	0
agree	1
what's	0
bad	0
for	0
the	1
soviet	0
system	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
have	0
the	1
resources	0
to	0
grow	1
and	0
produce	0
their	0
food	1
but	0
somehow	0
it	0
just	1
does	0
not	0
get	1
out	1
to	0
the	1
market	1
the	0
way	0
it	1
should	1

i	0
think	0
it's	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
oh	0
how	0
do	0
you	0
put	0
it	1
bureaucracy	1
and	0
and	0
and	1
uh	0
one	0
thing	1
and	0
then	0
all	0
the	0
corruption	1
i	0
think	0
there's	0
a	1
a	1
a	0
large	0
amount	0
of	0
corruption	1
on	0
the	0
the	0
have	0
and	0
the	0
have	0
nots	1
you	0
know	0
i	1

yeah	1
that's	0
probably	1
more	0
true	1
than	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
realize	1

i	1
i	0
know	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
that	0
with	0
every	0
society	1
at	0

at	0
least	0
we're	0
more	0
blatant	1
about	0
it	0
but	0
it's	0
very	0
secret	1
and	0
it's	0
been	0
going	0
on	0
for	0
years	1
i	0
mean	0
you	0
can't	1
change	0
things	0
overnight	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
but	0
if	0
it	0
gets	0
to	0
a	0
point	0
where	0
people	0
can't	1
survive	1
i	0
mean	0
there's	0
revolution	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
that's	1

it	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
headed	0
in	0
that	0
direction	1
too	0

[laughter-yeah]	0
big	0
time	1
major	1
but	1
you	0
know	0
that's	1
that's	0
what	0
happens	0
when	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
cork	0
blows	1
and	0
you	0
can't	0
handle	0
it	0
anymore	1
i	0
mean	1
that's	1
that's	0
the	0
way	1
the	0
world	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
revolves	1
that	0
way	0

uh-huh	0
well	0
their	0
knowledge	1
with	1
uh	0
better	1
communication	0
processes	1
in	0
this	0
world	1
now	1
that's	0
reached	1
them	0
is	0
more	1
educated	0
than	0
to	0
the	1
uh	0
ways	0
of	0
the	0
western	0
world	1

i	0
really	0
question	1
though	0
how	0
much	0
technology	0
the	0
average	1
soviet	1
is	0
exposed	0
to	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
big	1
stepping	0
stone	1
for	0
them	0
to	1
initiate	0
all	0
their	1
righteous	0
ways	1
of	1
changing	0
things	1
to	1

they	1
probably	0
not	0
enough	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	0
i	0
lot	0
of	0
it's	0
filtered	1
down	0
enough	0
to	0
the	0
common	1
folks	0
that	0
they	0
have	0
gotten	0
wind	1
of	0
what	0
they're	0
missing	0
out	1
on	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
they're	0
starting	0
to	0
realize	1
but	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
don't	0
think	0
they	0
have	0
the	1
resources	1
if	0
you	0
were	0
to	0
compare	1
uh	0
the	0
americans	0
to	0
the	0
soviets	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
home	0
computers	0
are	0
concerned	1
or	0
fact	1
machines	0
fax	0
machines	1
and	0
cellular	0
phones	1
and	0
state	0
of	0
the	0
art	0
equipment	1
that	0
we	0
are	0
so	0
used	1
to	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
they	0
even	1
realize	0
what's	0
out	0
there	1
and	0
to	0
what	0
extent	1

yeah	1
i'm	0
sure	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
them	0
are	0
missing	1
those	1
household	0
items	1

yeah	1
all	1
the	0
major	0
conveniences	0
of	0
life	1

yeah	0
what	0
we	0
consider	1
just	0
i	0
don't	1
[laughter-know]	0
normal	0
everyday	0
things	1
to	0
them	0
is	0
real	1
luxury	0
which	0
is	0
unfortunate	0
for	0
them	1

yeah	0

and	1
of	0
course	0
most	0
of	0
us	1
we	0
don't	0
really	0
appreciate	0
what	0
we've	0
got	1
because	0
we've	0
been	0
so	0
used	1
to	0
it	0

this	0
is	0
true	1
this	0
is	0
very	1
true	0
and	0
we	1
it's	0
human	1
it's	0
human	0
nature	0
though	1
to	1
take	0
things	0
for	0
granted	1
and	0
it	0
kind	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
when	0

when	0
you've	1
lost	0
something	1
or	1
or	0
uh	0
uh	0
don't	0
have	0
what	0
other	0
people	0
have	1
that's	0
when	0
you	0
tend	0
to	0
realize	1
you	0
know	1
what's	0
out	0
there	1
and	0
what	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
you	0
have	1
and	0
what	0
you	0
don't	0
have	1

yeah	0
i	0
agree	1

so	0
the	0
original	0
question	1
do	0
we	0
think	0
they're	0
a	0
threat	1
to	0
our	0
you	0
know	1
a	0
s[ecurity]	1
s[ecurity]	0
security	0
threat	1

yeah	1

um	0
yes	0
and	0
no	1

yeah	1
i	0
can	0
go	0
with	0
that	0
answer	0
too	1
the	0
only	0
yes	1
i	0
could	0
go	0
to	0
is	0
if	1
uh	0
a	0
renegade	1
crew	1
decides	0
to	0
launch	1
an	0
attack	1
or	0
an	0
accidental	0
launching	1
of	0
something	0
to	0
that	0
effect	1
to	1
for	0
to	0
a	0
nuclear	0
exchange	1
but	0
i	0
don't	0
even	0
see	0
that	0
occurring	1
uh	0
because	0
their	1
internal	0
strifes	1
are	0
more	0
important	0
right	0
now	1
than	1
concentrating	0
on	0
any	0
kind	0
of	0
outside	0
affairs	1
that	0
they	0
used	0
to	0
be	1
adapted	0
to	0
i	0
guess	1

um	0
no	1

well	0
i	0
don't	0
really	0
feel	1
that	0
the	0
soviets	0
really	0
want	0
to	0
blow	0
up	0
the	0
world	1
i	0
mean	1
um	0
we	1
painted	0
them	0
back	0
in	0
the	0
fifties	1
and	0
sixties	1
as	1
as	1
nonfeeling	1
machine	0
type	0
people	1
and	0
they're	0
people	0
just	0
like	0
us	1
i	0
mean	1
you	0
know	1
they	0
get	0
up	0
everyday	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
they	0
put	0
their	0
pants	0
on	0
the	0
same	0
way	1
and	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
eat	1
and	0
everything	0
else	1
and	0
i	0
just	0
don't	0
feel	1
that	1

it's	1
it's	0
hard	1
to[pic]	1
topic	0
because	0
is	1
it	1
is	1
it	0
is	0
it	0
doing	0
a	1
good	0
job	1
or	0
a	1
bad	1
job	0
and	1
you	1
got	1
to	0
divide	1
it	1
two	1
different	0
categories	1
whether	1
you	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
or	0
whether	1
you	0
live	1
in	1
a	0
more	0
rural	1
place	0
like	0
i	1
do	0

yeah	1
and	1
are	0
you	1
talking	0
about	1
public	0
schools	1
being	1
lower	0
level	0
high	0
school	1
level	1
or	0
state	1
school	0

well	0
public	0
school	0
all	0
the	1
way	0
up	0
kindergarten	0
all	1
the	0
way	0
up	1
to	0
uh	0
uh	1
high	0
school	1

okay	0
but	1
you're	1
excluding	1
high-level	0
education	1

yes	0
well	0
yeah	1
i	1
am	0
um	1

okay	0

act[ually]	0
actually	0
i	1
think	1
that	1
i	0
at	1
the	1
higher	0
level	1
education	1
i	1
don't	1
think	1
there's	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
a	1
problem	1
there	0
it's	0
pretty	0
much	1
funded	1
well	0
there	0
are	1
small	0
colleges	0
that	0
i'm	0
sure	0
are	0
struggling	1
but	1
uh	0
it's	1
the	0
job	1
that	0
the	0
the	1
high	1
school	1
and	0
the	0
grade	1
schools	0
are	1
doing	0
that	0
i	0
see	1
in	1
a	0
area	1
like	1
ours	0
our	0
school	0
even	0
a	0
bad	1
school	0
is	0
a	0
good	1
school	1
up	0
here	0
where	1
if	1
i	0
lived	1
in	0
new	0
york	0
city	1
or	1
washington	0
dc	1
uh	0
i	0
would	0
seriously	0
consider	0
moving	1
if	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
child	1
i	0
wouldn't	0
let	0
them	0
go	1
to	0
a	0
public	1
school	0
system	0
there	0
but	0
of	0
course	0
people	0
are	0
trapped	1
economically	1
and	0
they	0
can't	0
do	1
that	0

yeah	0
i	0
know	1
down	1
here	0
the	0
school's	1
are	0
you	0
know	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
they	1
rate	0
i	1
moved	0
to	0
arkansas	0
and	1
texas	1
after	0
living	0
in	0
ohio	1
and	1
the	0
schools	0
down	0
here	0
rate	0
you	0
know	0
bottom	0
ten	1
percent	1
across	0
the	0
country	0
and	0
having	0
been	1
through	1
grade	0
school	1
up	0
there	1
and	0
coming	0
down	0
here	0
to	0
high	1
school	0
i	0
can	0
understand	0
why	1
because	0
they're	0
so	0
far	0
behind	1
and	0
so	0
poorly	0
staffed	1
half	0
the	0
time	1
the	0
teachers	1
don't	1
know	0
what's	0
going	0
on	1

well	0
that's	0
really	0
too	0
bad	1
because	1
i[t]	0
it	0
it's	0
giving	0
some	0
people	1
unfair	0
advantage	1
i	0
mean	0
we	1
our	0
high	1
school	0
up	0
here	1
is	0
like	0
a	0
junior	0
college	1
in	0
florida	1

right	0

what	0
we	0
learned	0

well	0
that	0
was	0
my	0
experience	1
going	0
through	0
junior	0
high	0
up	0
there	1
when	0
i	0
came	0
down	1
south	0
for	1
high	1
school	0
i	0
was	1
just	0
repeating	1
what	1
i'd	0
already	0
done	1
because	0
we	0
were	0
so	0
far	0
advanced	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
i'd	0
been	0
in	0
a	0
parochial	1
school	0
before	0
junior	1
high	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
even	0
the	0
public	1
schools	0
are	1
behind	0
the	0
parochial	1
schools	0

yeah	0

so	1
you	0
know	1
i	1
i	0
like	0
the	0
concept	1
they've	0
got	0
now	1
where	0
they	0
have	0
more	0
directed	0
education	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
pick	0
a	0
career	0
path	1
or	0
you	1
get	0
counseling	0
earlier	1
and	0
then	1
you	0
you	0
learn	0
the	0
things	0
that	0
help	1
you	0
rather	0
than	0
spending	1
four	0
years	0
learning	0
the	0
same	0
things	0
over	0
and	0
over	1

oh	0
they	1
they	0
have	0
that	0
down	0
there	1
that	1

well	1
they	0
talk	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
few	1
in	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
more	1
like	0
in	0
i	0
live	1
in	0
a	0
big	0
metroplex	1
and	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
better	1
parts	0
of	0
the	0
metroplex	0
the	0
the	0
suburbs	0
that	0
are	0
richer	1
have	0
those	0
kind	0
of	0
target	1
schools	0
but	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	0
it's	0
like	1
if	1
if	0
your	0
father	0
owns	0
a	0
grocery	1
store	1
and	1
you're	0
really	1
interested	0
in	1
that	1
there's	0
no	0
reason	0
that	1
you	0
should	1
take	1
college	1
prep	0
courses	0
when	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
some	0
general	0
business	1
courses	0
in	1
high	1
school	0

right	0

or	0
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
the	0
science	1
route	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
target	0
school	0
that	0
specializes	0
in	0
science	1
or	0
art	1
you	0
know	0
there's	0
no	0
point	1
in	0
you	0
know	1
i'm	0
an	0
engineering	1
student	0
and	0
if	0
i	0
have	0
to	0
go	0
take	0
art	1
classes	0
you	0
know	0
i'm	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
use	1
them_1	0
and	0
through	0
high	1
school	0
i	0
could	0
have	0
gone	0
so	0
much	0
further	1
if	0
i'd	0
gone	0
to	0
a	0
school	1
that	0
was	0
directed	1

yeah	0
that's	0
where	0
i	0
was	0
fortunate	0
i'm	1
a	0
i'm	0
a	0
technician	1
and	0
we	0
had	0
a	0
vocational	1
um	1
electronics	1
in	1
our	1
high	0
school	0

right	0
in	0
high	0
school	0

so	0
when	0
i	0
went	1
to	1
my	1
first	0
year	0
of	0
tech	0
school	1
uh	0
i	1
had	1
a	0
very	0
easy	0
time	1
because	0
our	0
high	1
school	1
had	1
a	0
a	0
good	1
program	1

right	0

i	0
think	0
the	0
schools	0
today	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
public	1
schools	0
are	0
just	0
they're	0
just	0
overrun	1
you	0
know	0
they	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
to	0
do	1
there's	0
too	0
many	0
kids	1
and	0
not	0
enough	0
teachers	1
and	0
too	0
many	0
kids	0
don't	0
care	0

yeah	0
i	0
find	1
that	0
that	1
the	0
that	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
cities	1
it's	0
more	0
less	0
the	0
kids	0
go	0
there	1
to	0
socialize	1
not	0
really	0
to	0
learn	1
and	0

and	0

right	0

and	0
the	0
parents	1
send	0
them_1	0
there	0
because	0
they're	0
supposed	1
to	0
and	0
plus	0
it	0
gets	0
them	0
out	0
of	0
their	0
hair	1
and	0
i	0
also	1
find	0
that	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
send	1
a	0
kid	0
to	0
school	1
but	0
if	1
don't	0
work	0
with	0
them	0
as	0
a	0
parent	1
i	1
think	1
you're	0
putting	1
your	1
child	0
at	0
a	1
big	0
disadvantage	1

yeah	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
there's	0
some	1
kids	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
learn	1
but	0
most	0
of	0
them_1	0
just	0
want	0
to	1
go	0
play	0

yeah	0
well	0
i	0
could	1
i	0
could	0
see	1
if	0
a	0
kid	0
doesn't	0
have	0
any	0
encouragement	1
if	1
they're	1
you	1
know	0
come	0
from	0
a	1
broken	0
home	1
and	1
their	0
parents	1
are	0
more	0
concerned	0
about	1
trying	0
to	1
work	1
and	1
or	0
maybe	1
they're	0
unemployed	0
and	0
they're	0
mad	1
at	0
the	1
world	1
i	0
can	0
see	0
where	1
that	0
wouldn't	0
be	1
very	1
good	0
for	0
a	1
a	0
kid	1
you	0
know	1
he's	0
coming	0
up	1
will	0
you	0
help	0
me	0
with	0
my	0
homework	1
and	0
they're	1
no	1
get	0
away	1
from	0
me	0
i've	1
had	0
a	0
terrible	1
day	1
so	1
it's	0
got	1
a	0
lot	0
to	0
do	0
with	1
economics	1
in	1
the	1
area	1
that	0
you	1
come	1
from	0

yeah	0
that's	0
true	0
i'm	0
wondering	0
with	0
the	0
boom	0
down	0
here	0
it's	1
well	0
not	0
at	0
the	1
moment	0
but	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	0
industry's	0
moving	1
southward	1

yes	0
are	0
they	0
going	0
to	0
move	0
to	0
uh	0
mexico	1

so	0

oh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
about	0
that	1
but	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	0
industry	1
up	1
in	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
northern	1
states	0
is	0
moving	0
south	1

and	0
i'm	0
wondering	1
if	0
that's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
any	0
effect	1
you	0
know	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
see	0
now	1
we're	0
we're	0
we're	0
behind	0
down	0
here	1

yeah	0

i	0
say	0
we	0
because_1	0
i	0
live	1
here	0
if	0
that	0
might	0
not	0
turn	0
around	1
in	0
the	0
next	1
you	0
know	0
fifteen	0
twenty	0
years	1

yeah	0
maybe	1
the	0
maybe	0
they'll	1
bring	1
their	0
good	0
schools	1
with	0
them	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
the	1
industry	0
comes	1
hopefully	0
they'll	0
promote	0
good	0
schools	1

yeah	0

because	0
i	0
know	0
the	0
town	1
that	0
i	0
come	0
from	0
the	0
the	1
uh	1
the	0
large	1
ibm	0
plant	0
has	0
something	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
the	0
top	1
rated	0
high	0
school	0
because	0
of	0
their	0
tax	1
base	0
for	0
one	0
and	0
plus	1
for	0
for	1
the	0
type	0
of	0
student	1
that's	0
going	1
to	0
that	0
school	0
it's	0
going	1
to	0
raise	1
the	0
level	1
of	0
the	0
school	0
because	0
your	0
parents	1
are	1
engineers	1
or	0
chemists	1

right	0

they're	0
they're	0
you're	0
most	0
likely	0
to	0
do	1
better	0
in	1
school	1
they're	0
going	0
to	0
help	1
you	0

you	0
hope	0

yeah	0
you	0
hope	1
well	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	0
just	0
think	1
it	1
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
duty	0
of	0
the	0
parent	1
to	0
do	1
that	0
i	0
mean	1
jeez	1
my	0
parents	0
always	0
helped	0
me	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
like	0
you	0
say	0
it's	0
the	0
way	0
you're	0
raised	1
and	0
the	1
economic	1
situation	1
you're	0
in	0
i	0
can	0
see	0
some	0
lady	1
she's	0
twenty	0
one	0
years	0
old	0
and	0
she's	0
got	0
four	0
kids	1
a	0
kid	0
in	0
her	0
first	0
grader	0
i	0
don't	1
see	0
where	0
she's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
much	0
time	1
for	0
him	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
like	0

i	0
guess	0
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
wonder	0
is	0
it	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
is	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
who	1
whose	0
supposed	0
to	1
make	0
the	0
change	1
the	0
the	0
state	0
the	0
govern[ment]	0
the	0
federal	1
government	0
you	0
know	1
where's	0
the	0
money	0
supposed	1
to	0
come	1
from	0
is	0
it	1
you	0
know	0
what	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
actually	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
should	0
be	1
a	0
civic	1
level	0
the	0
city	1
level	0
and	0
a	0
a	0
system	1
level	0
really	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
and	0
t[o]	0
to	0
see	0
what	0
they	0
need	0
and	0
not	0
overinflate	1
it	0

what	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
advocate	1
more	0
taxes	0
or	0
better	0
management	0
of	0
what	1
they	0
got	0

like	1
if	0
the	0
teachers	0
are	0
getting	0
six	0
percent	0
raises	1
every	0
year	1
when	0
people	0
in	0
industry	0
have	0
been	0
getting	0
cut	0
back	1
and	0
you're	0
getting	0
raises	0
every	0
eighteen	0
months	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
go	1
hey	0
now	0
wait	1
a	0
minute	0
we're	0

yeah	0

we're	0
in	0
a	0
recession	1
here	0
we	1
uh	0
our	0
town	1
didn't	0
pass	0
the	0
school	1
budget	0
this	0
year	1
and	0
for	0
the	0
first	0
time	1
in	0
many	0
many	0
years	1
just	0
because	0
people	1
are	0
are	0
in	0
the	0
recession	1
and	0
they're	0
even	0
though	1
we've	1
uh	0
enjoyed	0
very	0
good	1
employment	1
here	0
for	0
the	0
past	0
ten	1
years	0
now	0
we	0
got	0
eight	1
percent	0
uh	0
unemployment	1
when	1
it	0
used	0
to	0
be	1
four	0
or	0
five	1
people	0
are	0
going	0
whoa	0

yeah	0

so	0

starts	0
hitting	0
closer	0
to	0
home	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	0
always	0
see	1
it's	0
all	0
it's	0
all	0
money	1
this	0
like	0
a	0
couple	0
other	0
topics	1
we	0
had	0
talked	0
about	0
was	0
crime	1
it	0
it's	0
it's	0
all	0
money	1
based	0
and	0
what	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
unless	0
you	0
just	0
get	0
down	0
to	0
the	0
parent	1
level	0
and	0
and	0
then	0
if	0
you're	0
in	0
a	0
bad	1
situation	0
where	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
send	0
your	0
child	0
to	0
a	0
bad	0
school	1
who	0
knows	0
bu[t]	0
maybe	1
we	0
do	0
we	0
need	0
some	0
more	0
catholic	0
schools	1
support	0
the	0
church	0
instead	0
they	0
seem	0
to	0
have	0
done	1
a	0
the	0
good	0
job	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
in	1
uh	0
some	1
places	1
uh	0
you	0
couldn't	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
public	0
school	1
it	0
was	0
miles	0
down	0
the	0
road	1
and	0
the	0
only	0
school	0
you	0
could	1
go	0
to	0
was	0
the	0
baptist	1
school	0
or	0
the	0
catholic	1
school	0
so	0

yeah	0
they're	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
strict	0

yeah	0
the	0
i	0
don't	0

you	0
uh	0
have	0
to	0
learn	0
you	0
aren't	0
given	1
the	0
chance	0
to	0
you	0
know	0
screw	1
off	0
all	0
the	0
time	0

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	0
would	0
do	1
that	0
to	0
my	0
[laughter-child]	1
[laughter-though]	1
but	0
so	0
hum	0
pretty	0
much	0
though	0
see	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
any	0
good	0
ideas	1
or	0
or	0
anything	0
that	0
would	0
contribute	1
see	0
this	0
isn't	0
a	0
subject	1
that	0
i	0
think	0
a	0
lot	0
about	1
because	1
i'm	0
never	0
faced	1
with	0
it	0
because	0
our	0
school	1
system	0
in	0
vermont	1
it	0
seems	0
to	0
do	0
a	0
really	0
good	0
job	1

well	1
i	0
know	1
i'm	1
in	0
the	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
only	0
reason	0
i	0
asked	0
about	0
secondary	1
schools	0
or	0
you	0
know	0
advanced	0
education	1
is	0
because	0
down	0
here	1
you	0
know	0
going	0
to	0
the	0
university	0
of	0
texas	1
the	0
education	0
i'm	1
getting	0
i	0
think	1
is	0
kind	0
of	0
shoddy	1
for	1
a	0
public	0
school	1

is	0
it	0

i	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i'm	0
getting	0
what	0
i	0
should	1
but	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
texas	1
it's	0
next	0
to	0
free	1
because	0
th[ey]	0
they	0
pay	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
it	0
it's	0
state	0
supported	0

well	0
that	0

but	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	1
it's	0
really	0
not	1
it's	0
not	0
like	0
going	0
to	0
mit	1
my	1
engineering	1
degree	0
will	0
be	0
nothing	0
like	0
somebody	0
coming	1
out	0
of	1
mit	1
and	0
that's	1
it's	1
really	0
too	0
bad	1

well	0

but	0
that's	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
just	0
builds	1
on	0
the	0
foundation	0
that	0
they've	0
already	0
built	1
you	1
get	0
people	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
schools	0
and	0
col[lege]	1
junior	1
colleges	0
that	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
background	1
for	0
an	0
mit	0
kind	0
of	0
curriculum	0
so	0

so	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
lesser	1
engineering	0
school	0
we	0
have	1
a	0
very	0
good	0
public	0
school	0
up	0
here	1
and	1
a	0
degree	1
out	0
there	0
means	0
a	0
lot	1
it's	0
a	0
very	1
good	0
school	1
it's	0
it's	0
university	0
of	0
vermont	1
um	0
we	1
also	0
have	0
some	0
two	0
year	0
college	1
well	1
there's	0
a	0
four	1
year	0
colleges	0
they	0
all	1
have	0
a	0
pretty	0
good	0
reputation	1
but	0
like	0
you	0
say	0
you	0

the	1
aids	1
issue	1
is	1
is	0
a	0
bit	0
of	1
a	1
problem	1
i	0
guess	0
the	0
first	0
thing	0
that	1
comes	0
to	1
my	1
mind	0
not	1
having	1
any	1
immediate	1
friends	0
with	1
that	1
problem	0
is	1
is	1
the	1
financial	1
end	1
i	1
mean	1
how	1
can	1
a	1
country	1
stand	1
to	1
uh	1
spend	0
as	1
much	1
or	1
much	0
more	1
than	0
they	0
already	1
are	0
on	0
such	0
a	0
problem	1
uh	0
but	0
then	1
that	1
kind	0
of	1
thinking	0
is	1
also	1
tempered	1
with	0
the	1
the	1
knowledge	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
the	0
the	0
rumor	1
i'm	0
not	0
really	1
sure	0
if	0
it's	1
true	0
or	0
not	1
that	1
uh	0
we're	1
not	0
spending	1
as	0
much	1
per	1
let's	0
say	1
afflicted	0
person	1
on	0
cancer	1
uh	0
there's	0
some	1
uh	0
take	0
breast	1
cancer	0
for	0
instance	0
it	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
doing	0
much	0
more	0
damage	1
and	0
affecting	0
much	0
more	0
peo[ple]	1
mean	0
more	0
people	0
than	0
aids	1
and	0
yet	1
uh	0
more	0
people	0
die	1
of	0
it	0
and	0
yet	0
the	0
funding	1
is	0
already	1
uh	0
exceeded	1
aids	0
has	0
more	0
money	1
than	0
uh	0
breast	1
cancer	0

and	1
well	1
that's	1
interesting	0
isn't	0
it	0
yeah	0

so	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	0
if	0
it's	0
true	1
i	0
i've	1
i've	0
always	0
heard	1
these	0
things	0
i've	0
never	0
bothered	1
to	0
dig	1
it	0
out	0
and	0
make	0
sure	1
but	0
uh	0
i've	0
heard	0
it	0
on	0
more	0
than	0
one	0
documentary	1
that	1
uh	0
they	0
were	0
complaining	1
that	1
whoever's	0
sitting	0
up	0
there	0
making	0
these	0
decisions	1
uh	0
or	0
whatever	0
institutions	0
raise	0
the	0
money	1
and	0
uh	1
it's	0
just	0
one	0
big	0
pr	0
campaign	1
that	0
yeah	0
we	0
think	0
that's	0
the	0
world's	0
worst	0
thing	1
so	0
let's	0
give	0
money	0
to	0
aids	1
and	0
yet	0
we've	0
had	0
breast	0
cancer	0
problems	0
for	0
years	1

right	1

and	1
it's	0
just	0
one	1
of	0
those	0
well	0
of	0
course	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
shows	1
i	0
saw	0
was	0
taking	0
it	0
from	0
the	0
angle	1
that	0
since	0
it	0
doesn't	0
effect	0
men	1
it's	0
not	0
gonna	0
get	0
funded	1
and	1
uh	0
having	0
thought	1
about	0
that	1
for	0
a	0
while	0

what	0
did	0
you	1
think	0
about	0
that	1
idea	0

well	1
i	1
i	0
kind	1
of	0
i	0
thought	1
well	1
that	0
that	1
might	0
be	0
possible	0
since	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
men	0
in	0
control	1
of	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
but	0
then	0
i	0
go[t]	1
i	0
got	0
to	0
thinking	1
the	0
the	0
number	0
one	0
killer	0
of	0
men	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
prostate	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
one	0
test	1
that	0
just	1
recently	1
got	0
developed	1
uh	0
a	0
blood	0
an[tigen]	1
antigen	1
uh	0
antibody	0
test	1
for	0
the	0
antigen	0
in	0
the	0
blood	1
and	0
that's	0
fairly	0
recent	1
and	0
yet	0
men	1
have	0
been	0
dying	0
from	0
prostate	0
cancer	0
for	0
years	1

they've	0
not	0
really	0
given	0
it	0
attention	1
either	1
yeah	1

so	1
it's	1
not	0
really	0
cure	0
f[or]	0
yeah	1
it's	1
not	0
uh	0
not	0
that	0
heavily	0
funded	0
either	1
and	0
that	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
the	0
major	1
uh	0
problems	1
that	0
men	1
have	0
in	0
the	0
realm	0
of	0
cancer	0
so	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
guess	0
there's	0
just	0
some	0
strange	1
public	0
opinion	1
as	0
to	0
who	0
they	1
want	0
to	0
give	0
to	0
um	0
be	1
it	0
through	1
different	0
organizations	1
march	0
of	0
dimes	0
type	1
uh	0
telethons	1
or	0
or	0
bicycle	1
rides	0
or	0
whatever	1
how	0
they	0
fund	1
whatever	1
um	0
illness	0
they	0
wish	1

right	1

it's	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1
to	0
to	0
get	0
an	0
even	0
keel	1
on	0
that	1
i	0
mean	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
say	1
well	1
there's	1
you	0
know	0
a	0
hundred	0
thousand	1
per	0
year	0
affected	0
by	0
this	1
one	0
so	0
let's	0
give	0
it	0
this	0
amount	1
and	0
then	0
this	0
other	0
one's	0
only	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	0
so	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	0
and	1
and	0
just	0
keep	1
doling	0
it	0
out	0
that	1
way	0
or	0

well	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
glad	0
i'm	0
not	1
the	0
one	0
that's	1
that's	1
in	0
charge	1
of	1
of	1
making	0
those	1
decisions	1
they	0
uh	1
you	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
could	0
just	0
be	0
money	0
for	0
all	1
these	0
problems	1
because_1	0
they're	1
all	1
so	0
serious	1
you	1
know	1
i	0
mean	1
it's	0
not	0
so	0
serious	1
i	1
guess	1
until	1
it	0
affects	0
your	0
family	1
and	1
then	0
all	1
the	1
sudden	1
it's	0
the	0
most	1
important	0
thing	0

right	1

so	1
i	0
i	0
would	1
hate	1
to	0
have	0
that	0
responsibility	0
just	0
personally	1
but	1
but	0
then	0
again	1
we	0
really	1
we	0
really	0
do	1
have	0
it	1
as	1
a	1
society	1
just	0
decides	0
which	1
things	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
address	1
i	1
uh	1
i	0
guess	0
i	1
it	1
it	1
frightens	1
me	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
so	0
many	0
people	0
with	1
with	1
aids	0
and	1
with	1
cancer	1
and	1
many	1
of	0
those	0
things	0
um	0
if	0
they're	0
not	0
able	1
to	0
to	0
be	0
insured	1
then	0
the	0
country's	1
gonna	0
pay	0
for	1
it	0
one	1
way	1
or	0
the	0
other	1
whether	1
it's	0
through	0
prevention	1
or	0
or	1
treatment	1
or	1
you	1
know	1
just	1
uh	0
just	0
helping	1
the	0
people	1
when	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	1
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
themselves	1

right	1

it	0
seems	0
like	0
one	1
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
we're	0
gonna	0
end	0
up	0
paying	1
for	0
it	0

that's	0
true	1

just	1

you	0
know	1
the	1
the	0
other	1
thought	0
that	0
i	0
had	1
um	0
i've	0
had	1
several	0
minutes	0
to	0
think	1
about	0
this	0
after	1
i	0
uh	0
while	0
i	0
was	0
finding	1
people	0
i	1
uh	0
i	0
could	0
think	0
about	0
the	0
topic	1
longer	0
than	0
the	0
person	0
that	0
receives	1
it	0
so	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
a	0
unfair	0
advantage	1
as	0
they	0
were	0
but	0

but	0
the	0
other	0
thing	0
that	0
i've	0
thought	0
of	0
on	0
this	1
is	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
there	0
isn't	1
enough	0
money	1
uh	0
in	0
our	0
economy	1
or	0
in	0
our	0
system	0
uh	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
there's	0
so	0
much	1
that	0
goes	1
to	0
things	0
that	0
don't	0
really	1
do	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	0
of	0
good	0
i	0
mean	1
yeah	1
they're	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
but	1
we	0
have	0
such	0
an	0
affluent	0
[s]ociety	1
society	1
that	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
if	0
we	1
took	0
a	0
little	1
from	0
here	0
and	0
there	0
and	0
the	0
other	0
if	0
we	0
might	1
wind	1
up	0
with	0
a	0
uh	0
cure	0
for	0
just	0
about	0
everything	1
of	0

just	1
change	1
our	0
p[riorities]	0

of	0
course	0
then	0
we	0
wouldn't	0
have	0
any	0
room	0
to	0
put	0
people	1
but	1
[laughter-that's]	0

right	1
just	1
change	0
our	0
priorities	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
you	0
hear	0
these	0
ridiculous	0
figures	0
for	0
pizza	1
or	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
these	0
phenomenal	1
amount	0
of	0
dollars	1
spent	0
for	0
this	0
that	0
or	0
the	0
other	0
and	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
all	1
the	0
arts	1
that	0
that	0
are	0
nice	0
and	0
aesthetic	1
but	0
are	0
they	1
that	1
enhancing	0
for	0
the	1
m[asses]	0
for	0
the	1
masses	1
you	0
know	1
they	0

right	1

they	0
certainly	0
do	0
well	1
for	0
those	0
who	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
symphony	0
orchestra	0
and	0
all	0
that	1
but	0
uh	0
had	0
all	0
that	0
donation	1
and	0
time	1
and	0
labor	0
and	0
effort	1
gone	0
toward	0
something	0
else	1

so	1
well	1
you['re]	0
you['re]	1
you're	1
you	1
you	0
take	0
this	1
subject	0
much	0
more	0
personally	0
than	1
i	1
do	0
i	0
suppose	1

i	0
suppose	0
i	1
do	1
because	0
i've	0
seen	0
a	1
lot	1
of	1
those	0
changes	1
the	0
the	0
changes	1
that	1
women	0
have	1
had	0
in	0
the	1
last	1
genera[tion]	1
well	1
you	1
know	1
not	0
even	0
the	1
last	1
generation	1
the	1
last	1
fifteen	1
years	1
twenty	1
years	1
going	0
from	1

uh-huh	1

well	1
take	1
it	1
back	1
thirty	1
years	1
i'm	1
going	0
back	1
too	0
far	1
from	1
my	0
parents'	1
generation	1
when	1
mom	0
stayed	1
home	1
period	1
an[d]	1

yeah	1

and	0
there	1
was	0
no	1
such	1
thing	1
as	0
a	1
job	1
or	1
any	0
hope	0
of	1
a	0
job	1
until	0
well	1
unless	1
if	1
you	0
were	0
educated	1
you	0
got	1
you	1
know	1
you	0
might	0
teach	0
for	1
a	0
year	0
or	0
two	0
before	1
you	0
got	0
married	1

yeah	1

and	1
if	0
you	0
really	0
pushed	0
it	0
you	1
taught	0
until	0
you	0
had	0
kids	1
or	0
something	1
you	0
know	0
if	1

yeah	1

if	1
you	1
had	1
if	0
you	0
were	0
a	1
teacher	1
then	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
was	0
it	1
until	0
the	0
kids	0
you	1
were	0
little	1

yeah	0
you	1
you	0
weren't	0
supposed	0
to	0
want	1
a	0
job	1

yes	1
there	0
was	0
not	1
there's	0
not	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
any	1
reason	0
to	0
use	0
this	1
education	1
or	0
this	1
brain	0
that	0
you	0
might	1
have	1
for	1
anything	0
other	1
than	0
your	0
house	1
and	0
your	0
children	1
and	0
how	1
clean	1
can	1
the	0
the	0
bathroom	0
floors	0
be	0
on	0
any	0
given	1
day	0

yeah	1

and	0
then	1
and	0
then	0
of	0
course	0
today	0
it's	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
all	0
the	0
other	0
way	1
you're	0
supposed	0
to	0
only	0
want	0
the	0
job	1
and	0
and	0
uh	0
your	0
kids	0
should	0
be	0
totally	0
happy	0
in	0
day	0
care	1
because	0
everybody	0
else	0
goes	0
to	0
day	0
care	1

yeah	1

and	0
and	1
we	0
have	0
these	0
wonderful	0
people	0
who	1
are	1
who	0
are	0
totally	0
prepared	1
to	0
tea[ch]	0
to	0
teach	0
your	1
child	0
everything	0
they	1
need	0
to	0
know	0
in	0
day	1
care	0
and	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1
but	0
but	0
but	0
uh	0
a	0
really	0
good	0
day	0
care	0
is	0
probably	0
going	0
to	0
cost	0
more	0
than	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
make	0
at	0
the	0
job	1

and	0
and	0
uh	1
we'll	0
see	0
how	0
the	0
generations	0
go	1
huh	0

yeah	1
i	0
at	0
least	0
for	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
women	0
depending	0
on	1
on	0
what	0
she	0
did	1
i've	1

yeah	1

i've	1
i	0
was	0
an	0
engineer	1
with	0
uh	1
mechanical	1
engineer	0
with	0
t	0
i	1
and	1
uh	0
i	0
did	0
it	0
for	0
six	0
years	1
and	1
for	0
one	1
well	0
i	0
had	1
one	0
while	0
i	0
was	0
pregnant	1
and	0
then	0
one	1
while	0
my	1
oldest	0
was	0
a	0
year	0
old	1
and	0
and	0
it	0
just	0
drove	0
me	0
crazy	1

did	0
you	0

i	0
could	0
not	0
do	0
either	1
well	1
enou[gh]	0
i	0
couldn't	0
put	0
in	0
enough	1
overtime	0
that	0
was	0
necess[ary]	1
or	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
things	0
that	0
would	0
come	1
up	0
at	0
work	1
that	0
would	0
require	0
me	0
to	0
stay	0
late	1
or	0
to	0
come	0
in	0
early	0
or	0
to	0
do	0
something	0
on	0
saturdays	1
as	1
is	0
you	1
know	0
as	0
is	0
needed	1
and	0
because	0
my	0
husband	1
had	0
had	0
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	0
was	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
country	1
also	1
with	0
uh	0
with	0
work	1
for	0
like	0
three	1
months	0
and	0

um-hum	0

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
and	0

so	0
it	0
was	0
you	0
and	0
the	0
kid	1
and	0
your	0
work	0
schedule	1
is	0

yeah	1

well	0
that's	0
the	0
thing	0
see	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	0
if	0
you	0
get	0
along	0
for	0
example	0
if	0
you'd	0
been	0
a	0
technician	1
instead	0
of	0
an	0
engineer	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
technicians	0
work	0
the	1
eight	0
to	0
five	0
job	1
and	0
and	0
know	0
when	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
there	0

yeah	1
it	0
might	0
have	1
been	1
better	1

yeah	1

but	0
uh	0
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
more	1
pro[fessional]	1
professional	0
oriented	1
then	0
you've	0
got	0
to	1
have	0
this	1
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
perform	0
well	0
on	1
the	0
job	1
you've	0
got	0
to	0
have	0
the	1
flexibility	1
that	1
that	0
doesn't	0
really	0
go	0
with	0
the	0
family	1

yeah	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
in	0
my	1
case	0
i	1
i	0
just	1
uh	0
decided	1
that	0
as	0
long	0
as	0
my	1
kids	0
were	1
little	1
i	0
would	0
be	0
better	0
off	1
at	1
home	0
with	1
them	0
instead	0
of	1
driving	0
myself	1
crazy	0
trying	0
to	1
do	1
everything	0
at	0
once	1

um-hum	0
so	1
you	0
figure	0
one	0
of	0
these	0
days	0

well	0
actually	0
i've	0
found	0
out	0
that	0
i'm	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
back	0
to	1
being	0
an	0
engineer	1

you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
back	0
to	0
being	0
an	0
engineer	1
is	0
that	0
what	0
you	0
think	1

i'm	0
i'm	1
i'm	0
a	0
photographer	1
now	1

oh	0
okay	0
you've	0
found	0
something	0
else	1

i	0
have	1
i	0
have	0
branched	1
out	0
i	0
was	0
a	0
photographer	0
before	1
but	0
when	0
i	0
went	0
to	0
college	0
it	0
was	1
i	0
felt	0
like	0
i	0
couldn't	0
support	0
myself	0
if	0
i	0
decided	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
photographer	1
that	0
it	1
would	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
hobby	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
i'm	1
i'm	1
very	0
mechanical	1
and	0
mechanical	0
engineering	0
interested	0
me	1
so	0
i	0
did	0
that	1
and	0
then	1
i	1
you	0
know	0
i	0
did	0
that	0
for	0
six	1
years	0
and	0
then	0
i	1
stayed	0
home	0
with	0
my	0
son	1
and	0
did	0
nothing	1
and	0
found	0
out	0
that	0
i	0
was	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
great	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
i	0
was	0
bored	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
time	0
too	1
and	0
i	0
wanted	0
something	1
else	0
to	0
do	1

yeah	0
i	1
mean	0
you	1
figure	0
there's	0
got	0
to	0
be	0
more	0
to	1
life	1
than	0
sitting	1
here	0
playing	0
with	1
this	1
child	1

yeah	0
and	0
it['s]	1
it's	0
great	1
while	0
they're	0
really	0
little	0
but	0
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1
and	0
they're	0
more	0
independent	1
and	0
there's	0
things	0
to	0
do	1
then	0
it's	0
good	1
for	0
them	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
different	1

um-hum	1

i	0
mean	0
it	1
he	0
goes	1
to	0
a	1
a	0
mother's	0
day	0
out	0
program	0
now	0
once	0
a	0
week	1
both	0
of	0
my	0
kids	0
do	1
and	0
so	0
they're	0
getting	1
they	1
they	0
get	0
the	0
socialization	0
with	0
other	0
kids	1
and	0
y[ou]	0
you	1
know	0
and	0
not	0
really	0
school	1
but	1
but	0
a	0
different	0
authority	0
than	0
mom	0
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
kind	0
of	0
learning	0
how	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
society	1

and	1
and	0
they	1
they	1
need	0
that	1
you	1
know	0
to	0
be	0
able	1
to	0
relate	0
to	1
other	0
people	0
besides	1
the	0
same	0
person	0
every	0
day	1

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
they	0
do	1
too	0

and	0
i	0
need	0
it	0
for	0
the	0
break	1

yeah	1
well	0
that's	0
the	1
other	0
thing	0
you	1
know	0
they	0
talk	0
about	1
women	1
leaving	0
the	1
home	1
and	0
going	0
out	0
to	0
work	1
well	1
still	1
taking	0
care	0
of	0
the	0
children	0
is	1
a	0
very	0
important	0
job	1
and	1

um-hum	1

and	1
and	1
someone's	0
got	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
and	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
do	0
it	1
right	1
and	1
and	0
if	0
it's	0
not	1
if	0
it's	1
not	0
mom	1
then	0
then	0
dad	0
or	0
somebody's	0
got	0
to	1
move	1
in	0
there	0
and	0
do	0
the	0
job	1
because	0
the	0
kids	0
really	0
need	1
it	0

and	0
enjoy	1
it	0
that's	1
that's	0
the	0
whole	1
thing	0

yeah	1

i	0
think	0
that's	0
the	0
thing	1
that	0
were	0
going	0
to	0
see	1
well	0
i	0
think	0
the	1
biggest	0
thing	0
we're	0
going	0
to	0
see	1
coming	0
up	0
in	0
the	1
next	1
ten	1
year[s]	0
even	1
in	0
the	0
even	0
now	1
they're	0
starting	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
more	0
in	1
the	0
next	0
ten	0
to	0
fifteen	0
years	1
is	0
that	1
there's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
women	1
and	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	0
work	0
it	0
out	0
to	0
working	0
part	0
time	1

um-hum	0

because	0
if	0
if	1
i	0
if	0
i	0
had	0
been	0
allowed	0
to	0
work	1
you	0
know	0
maybe	0
thirty	0
hours	0
a	0
week	0
instead	1
of	0
fifty	0
hours	0
a	0
week	1
i	0
might	0
still	0
be	0

different	0
directions	1
i	1

was	0
just	0
driving	0

crazy	1
and	0
now	0
with	0
the	0
photography	1
that's	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
working	1
that's	0
what	0
i'm	0
doing	0
is	0
working	0
part	0
time	1
because	0
i	0
can	0
put	1
my	0
kids	1
in	0
a	0
day	0
care	0
situation	0
for	1
a	0
few	0
hours	1
in	0
the	0
uh	0
week	1
and	0
and	1
use	0
those	0
hours	0
to	0
do	1
the	1

yeah	1

the	1
the	0
thing	0
that	0
i'm	0
doing	0
is	1
taking	0
school	0
pictures	1
in	1
day	0
cares	1
and	0
in	1
mother's	0
day	0
out	0
programs	1
and	0
also	0
soccer	0

and	0
you	0

different	0
stuff	1
like	0

for	1
a	0
few	0
hours	0
a	0
week	1
or	0
my	0
husband	1
if	0
it's	0
you	0
know	1
an[d]	0
an[d]	1
when	0
he's	0
at	0
home	1
can	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
them	0

yeah	0
so	0
jobs	0
have	0
to	0
i	0
guess	0
become	0
more	0
flexible	1

i	0
think	0
they're	0
really	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
and	0
not	1
and	0
not	0
just	0
for	0
mothers	1
for	0
fathers	0
as	1
well	1

yeah	1

it's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
both	1

well	0
so	0
so	1
that's	0
another	0
thing	0
that	0
has	0
to	0
adapt	1
is	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
the	1
the	0
father's	0
attitudes	1
about	0
you	0
know	0
who[se]	0
whose	0
job	0
is	1
this	0

yeah	1

well	1
it['s]	0
it's	0
his	1
job	0
too	0
and	0
i	1
to	0
me	0
the	0
only	0
important	0
issue	0
is	0
the	0
children	1
because	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
housework	0
goes	1
you	0
know	1
men	0
can	0
do	0
housework	0
just	0
as	0
easily	0
as	0
women	1
and	0
thanks	0
to	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
new	0
inventions	0
housework	0
doesn't	0
take	0
as	1
much	1
time	0
as	0
it	0
used	1
to	0
so	1
uh	0

it's	0
just	0
convincing	1
your	0
husband	0
that's	0
important	1
or	0
that	1
that	1
that	0
it's	0
important	0
enough	0
for	1
him	0
to	0
do	1
it	0

yeah	1
to	0
yeah	1
to	0
m[e]	0

yeah	1
well	1

because	1
if	0
he	0
saw	0
mom	1
doing	0
only	0
that	1
you	0
know	0
all	0
the	0
time	0
he	0
was	0
growing	0
up	1
then	0
it's	0
hard	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
it	1
in	0
that	0
other	1
you	0
know	0
uh	1
that	0
i	0
should	0
do	1
it	0
or	0
tha[t]	1
or	0
just	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
doing	1
it	0
rather	0
than	0
having	0
someone	1
tell	0
him	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
i	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

and	0
you	0
you	0
you	1

yeah	1
you	0
talk	1
yeah	1

yeah	1

i	0
know	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
big	0
thing	1
in	0
our	0
house	0
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	0
was	0
that	1
if	0
i	0
wanted	0
my	0
husband	0
to	0
do	0
something	0
to	0
help	1
and	0
even	0
though	0
we	0
were	0
both	0
working	0
the	0
same	0
number	0
of	0
hours	1
and	0
and	0
doing	0
things	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
come	0
in	0
there	0
specifically	1
and	0
say	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
this	0

um-hum	0

yeah	1

this	0
is	0
what	0
you	0
do	1
it	0
now	1
[laughter-no]	1

and	0
a	0
man	0
might	0
say	0
out	0
loud	1
well	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
understand	0
this	1
and	0
i	0
agree	1
but	0
still	0
he	0
was	0
raised	0
with	0
a	0
mom	0
taking	0
care	1
of	0
him	0
and	0

yes	1
and	1

and	0
and	0
that's	0
a	1
very	0
hard	0
attitude	0
to	0
change	1

yeah	0
and	0
without	1
and	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
they	0
don't	0
look	0
at	0
things	1
most	0
men	0
don't	0
walk	0
into	0
the	0
kitchen	0
and	0
see	0
that	0
the	0
dishes	0
are	0
there	1
and	0
that	0
yes	1
you	0
probably	0
ought	0
to	0
unload	0
the	0
dishwasher	1
and	0
load	0
the	0
new	0
ones	0
in	1
and	0
run	1
it	0

um-hum	0

they	0
just	0
you	0
know	1
just	0
kind	0
of	0
scoot	0
it	0
on	0
another	0
spot	1
on	1
the	0
on	0
the	0
sink	1
and	1
and	0
put	0
the	0
next	0
plate	0
down	1
and	1
and	0
in	0
a	0
while	0
get	0
around	1
to	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
think	0
most	0
women	0
walk	1
in	0
and	0
and	0
and	1
with	0
oh	0
got	0
to	0
clean	0
all	0
this	0
up	1
got	0
to	0
get	0
this	1
out	1
and	0
this	0
in	1
and	0
this	1
you	0
know	0
taken	0
care	1
of	0
instead	0
of	0
having	0
someone	0
say	1
now	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
do[ne]	1
this	0
is	0
the	0
time	1
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
but	0

hm	0
uh	0
um-hum	1
yeah	1

and	0

but	0

and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
that	1
is	0
is	0
how	0
it	0
was	0
drilled	0
into	0
you	0
when	0
you	0
were	0
a	0
kid	1
which	0
brings	0
us	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
idea	1
you	0
know	0
someone's	0
got	0
to	0
be	0
there	0
taking	0
care	0
of	0
the	0
kids	0
to	0
drill	1
in	0
these	1
you	0
know	0
drill	0
in	0
the	0
right	1
ideas	0
to	0
so	0
that	0
they	0
know	1
that	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
male	0
and	0
female	0
are	0
both	0
responsible	0
for	0
doing	1
this	0
and	0

that's	0
right	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

um-hum	0

and	0
and	1
uh	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
that's	1
that's	1
going	0
to	0
show	0
up	0
a	0
lot	0
more	1
now	0
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
next	0
generation	0
of	1
of	0
boys	0
and	0
girls	1
it's	0
not	1
they're	0
not	0
going	1
to	0
the	0
boys	0
in	0
this	0
next	0
generation	0
are	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
told	1
as	0
much	0
this	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
because	0
mom	0
was	0
there	1
saying	0
that	0
dad	0
is	0
there	1
you	0
know	0
you	0

uh-huh	0


you	0
both	0
got	1
to	0
they	0
were	0
both	0
working	0
at	0
whatever	0
things	1
were	0
needed	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
they're	0

um-hum	0

um-hum	0

they're	0
going	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
the	0
kids	1
you	0
need	0
do	0
this	1
because	0
it	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
not	0
because	1
it's	0
a	0
woman's	1
job	0
or	0
a	0
man's	1
job	0
but	0
because	0
it's	0
dirty	1
and	0
it	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
cleaned	1

um-hum	0

yeah	1

yeah	1

but	0
i	0
think	0
in	0
between	0
we	0
got	1
a	0
a	0
group	0
of	0
kids	0
a	0
generation	0
of	0
kids	0
who	1
didn't	0
learn	0
to	0
take	0
responsibility	1
because	1
mom	0
left	0
to	0
go	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
and	0
dad	0
didn't	0
move	0
in	0
to	0
fill	0
the	0
gap	1
and	0
so	0
basically	0
no	0
one	0
was	0
taking	0
the	0
responsibility	1

and	0
it's	0
gonna	1
it's	0
gonna	1
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
that's	0
happened	0
in	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
cases	1

yeah	1
some	0
kids	0
are	0
really	1
having	0
it	0
if	0
they'd	0
been	0
in	0
day	0
care	0
the	0
entire	0
time	1
and	0
it	0
wasn't	1
yeah	1
the	0
ones	0
that	0
are	0
now	0
getting	0
to	0
be	0
teenagers	1
and	0
in	0
some	0
cases	0
young	0
college	1

um-hum	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
some	0
time	0
day	0
care	0
is	0
really	0
good	1
but	0

yeah	1

but	0
sometimes	0
it's	0
just	1
it's	0
baby	1
sitting	0

yeah	1

it's	0
someone	0
you	0
know	0
keeping	0
an	0
eye	0
on	0
the	0
kids	1
but	0
the	0
kids	0
are	0
basically	0
doing	0
what	0
they	0
want	1
and	0
not	0
really	0
having	0
any	1
relationship	0
with	0
the	0
adults	0
to	0
say	0
you	0
know	0
here's	0
what's	0
right	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
here's	0
what's	0
wrong	1
and	0
and	0
here's	0
what	0
we	0
expect	1
of	0
you	0

yeah	0
i	1
think	0
that	0
was	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
main	0
reasons	0
that	0
i	0
quit	1
was	0
because	0
i	0
wanted	0
my	0
kids	0
to	0
have	0
my	1
values	0
and	0
i	0
felt	0
like	0
when	0
they	0
were	0
young	1
that	0
was	0
the	0
time	1
to	0
instill	1
it	0
that	0
it	0
could	0
be	1
it	0
could	0
be	0
added	1
to	0
and	0
strengthened	0
as	0
they	0
grew	0
older	1
but	0
when	0
they	0
were	0
little	1
you	0
know	0
this	0

yeah	1

this	0
is	0
the	0
way	0
i	0
feel	0
about	1
this	0
and	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
way	1
because_1	1
i	0
it's	0
you	1
know	0
when	1
you	0
when	0
you	0
if	0
you	1
if	0
you	0
teach	0
them	0
when	0
they're	0
little	1
the	0
way	0
you	0
want	0
them	0
to	0
be	1
and	0
the	0
things	0
that	0
are	0
important	0
to	0
you	1
then	0
you	0
just	1
you	0
add	0
onto	0
it	0
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

um-hum	0

but	0
if	0
no	0
one	0
does	0
anything	0
when	0
they're	0
little	1
then	0
it's	0
twice	0
as	0
hard	1
as	0
i	0
think	1
as	0
they	0
get	0
older	1

yeah	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
saying	0
this	0
as	0
i'm	0
trying	0
to	0
keep	0
my	0
nine	0
month	0
old	0
from	0
trashing	1
something	0

yes	0
i	0
understand	1
i	1
i	0
wait	0
until	0
i	0
put	0
mine	0
in	0
bed	0
before	0
i	0
make	0
my	0
calls	1

yeah	0
well	0
she's	0
usually	1
in	0
bed	0
by	0
this	0
time	0
but	0
she's	0
staying	0
up	0
late	1
tonight	0
but	0
yeah	0
you	0
know	0
i	0
want	1
to	0
i	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
relationship	0
with	0
her	1
you	0
know	0
m[y]	1
my	0
dad	0
was	0
a	0
very	0
traditional	0
dad	1
and	0
when	0
i	0
was	0
a	0
child	0
i	0
didn't	0
really	0
know	1
my	0
dad	0
very	0
well	0
and	0
i	0
miss	1
that	0
and	0
i	0
want	1

that's	0
the	0
thing	0
if	0
woman's	0
role	1
like	0
we	0
said	0
if	0
women's	1
roles	0
change	0
drastically	0
men's	0
roles	0
will	0
too	1

yeah	0
the	0
men	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
convinced	0
of	0
that	1

and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
it's	0
for	0
the	0
better	1
some	1
of	0
the	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
women's	0
roles	0
i	0
think	0
are	0
almost	0
for	0
the	0
worse	1
because	0
we're	0
losing	0
out	0
on	0
some	0
things	0
going	0
back	0
to	0
work	1
but	0
i	0
think	1
if	0
we	0
can	1
if	0
we	0
can	0
expand	0
the	0
men's	0
roles	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	1
like	0
your	0
taking	0
care	0
of	0
your	0
child	1
and	0
your	0
dad	0
probably	0
didn't	0
very	1
often	0
i	0

no	1

i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
mine	0
almost	0
never	1
did	0
