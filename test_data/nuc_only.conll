yeah	1
it's	0
um	0
it's	0
in	0
the	0
other	0
room	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
we	0
have	0
enough	1
time	1
for	0
it	0
it's	0

oh	1

it's	0
real	0
easy	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
unique	0
things	1
in	0
this	0
like	0
a	0
pound	0
of	0
ground	0
beef	1
some	0
bread	0
crumbs	1
um	0
an	0
egg	1
um	0
um	1
what	1
ever	0
seasoning	1
usually	0
just	0
light	0
seasonings	1

yeah	1

seasonings	1
like	0
salt	0
and	0
pepper	1
um	0
and	0
chopped	0
up	0
water	0
chestnuts	1
which	0
is	0
something	0
different	1
um	0

oh	1

that	0
would	0
be	0
wonderful	1

makes	0
them	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
crunchy	1
you	0
need	0
to	0
chop	0
them_1	0
up	0
real	0
fine	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	1
it	0
makes	0
them	0
crunchy	1
and	0
that	0
adds	0
something	1
new	0
to	0
it	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
sauce	0
is	0
just	0
made	1
with	0
um	0
bouillon	1
cubes	1
water	1
burgundy	0
wine	1
and	1
um	0
cornstarch	1
instead	0
of	0
flour	1

um-hum	1

oh	1

so	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
thick	1
rich	0
type	0
of	0
a	0
sauce	1
it's	0
more	1
of	0
a	1
when	0
you	0
use	0
corn	0
starch	1
in	0
in	0
gravy	1
like	0
you	0
know	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
um	0
Chinese	1
food	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
gravy	1
or	0
a	0
sauce	1
that	0
comes	0
with	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
that	1
they	0
use	0
corn	0
starch	0
instead	0
of	0
flour	1
in	0
all	0
of	0
their	0
sauces	0
and	0
gravies	1

um-hum	1

and	0
it	0
gives	0
it	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
different	0
consistency	1

well	0
um	0
how	0
long	0
do	0
you	1
cook	0
the	0
meatballs	1

the	0
meatballs	0
you	0
just	1
um	0
after	0
you	1
form	1
them	0
fry	0
them	0
in	0
a	0
pan	1
until	1
they're	1
uh	0
browned	0
on	0
all	1
all	0
sides	1
and	0

uh	0
huh	1

and	0
then	0
drain	0
off	0
all	0
the	0
grease	1
uh	0
then	0
what	0
i	0
usually	0
do	0
is	0
i	0
freeze	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you're	0
ready	1
to	0
serve	1
them	0
then	0
you	0
cook	0
the	0
sauce	1
and	0
then	0
put	0
the	1
meatballs	0
into	1
the	0
sauce	0
and	1
heat	1
it	0
probably	0

oh	1

yeah	1

probably	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
heat	0
it	0
up	0
for	0
a	0
good	1
oh	1
if	0
they're	0
frozen	1
you	0
know	0
it	0
may	0
take	0
a	0
half	0
hour	1
for	0
them	0
to	0
thaw	0
out	0
but	0
then	1
heat	0
them	0
thoroughly	1
in	0
the	0
sauce	0
itself	1
let	0
them	1
simmer	0
in	0
the	0
sauce	0
itself	1

hum	0

that's	0
real	0
good	1

that	0
sounds	0
great	1
especially	0
i	0

on	0
etiquettcy	1
and	0
all	0
the	0
little	0
bitty	0
things	1
that	0
i	0
didn't	0
even	0
know	1
i	0

oh	0
really	1

really	1

i	0
mean	0
i	0
thought	0
for	0
sure	0
i'd	0
been	0
raised	0
properly	1
but	0

but	0
i'd	0
been	0
doing	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
things	0
wrong	0
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
about	1

but	1
um	0
so	1
is	0
there	0
anything	0
else	1

well	1
i	0
i	0
think	0
we've	1
we've	0
covered	0
the	0
subject	1
i've	0
got	0
some	1
interesting	0
information	0
about	0
crawfish	1
i	0
was	0
in	0
fact	0
i	0

it's	0
good	0
cause	0
i	0
was	0
curious	0
about	0
that	0
today	0
when	0
i	0
saw	0
those	0
for	0
sale	1

oh	0
yes	1

yes	1
you	0
need	0
to	0
try	1
them_1	0
oh	0
they're	0
wonderful	1

oh	0
i	0
will	1
i'm	0
sure	0
my	0
husband	0
will	0
be	1
surprised	1
because_1	0
we	0
were	0
talking	0
about	0
them	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
even	0
before	1

the	1
AIDS	1
issue	1
is	1
is	1
a	1
bit	0
of	0
a	1
problem	1
i	1
guess	0
the	0
first	0
thing	0
that	0
comes	0
to	1
my	1
mind	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
immediate	1
friends	0
with	1
that	1
problem	0
is	0
is	1
the	1
financial	1
end	1
i	1
mean	1
how	1
can	1
a	1
country	1
stand	1
to	0
uh	1
spend	0
as	1
much	1
or	1
much	0
more	1
than	0
they	1
already	1
are	0
on	0
such	0
a	0
problem	1
uh	0
but	0
then	1
that	1
kind	0
of	1
thinking	0
is	1
also	1
tempered	1
with	0
the	1
the	1
knowledge	1
or	0
at	0
least	1
the	0
the	1
rumor	1
i'm	0
not	1
really	1
sure	0
if	0
it's	1
true	0
or	1
not	1
that	1
uh	0
we're	1
not	0
spending	1
as	0
much	1
per	1
let's	0
say	1
afflicted	0
person	1
on	0
cancer	1
uh	0
there's	0
some	1
uh	0
take	0
breast	1
cancer	0
for	0
instance	0
it	0
seems	1
to	0
be	1
doing	0
much	0
more	1
damage	1
and	1
affecting	0
much	0
more	0
peo[ple]	1
mean	1
more	0
people	0
than	0
AIDS	1
and	0
yet	1
uh	0
more	0
people	0
die	1
of	0
it	1
and	0
yet	0
the	0
funding	1
is	0
already	1
uh	0
exceeded	1
AIDS	0
has	0
more	0
money	1
than	0
uh	0
breast	1
cancer	0

and	1
well	1
that's	1
interesting	0
isn't	0
it	1
yeah	0

so	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	0
if	0
it's	1
true	1
i	0
i've	1
i've	0
always	0
heard	1
these	0
things	0
i've	1
never	0
bothered	1
to	1
dig	1
it	0
out	0
and	0
make	0
sure	1
but	0
uh	0
i've	0
heard	0
it	0
on	1
more	0
than	0
one	0
documentary	1
that	1
uh	0
they	0
were	0
complaining	1
that	1
whoever's	0
sitting	0
up	1
there	0
making	0
these	0
decisions	1
uh	0
or	0
whatever	1
institutions	0
raise	0
the	0
money	1
and	0
uh	1
it's	0
just	0
one	0
big	0
PR	0
campaign	1
that	0
yeah	0
we	0
think	0
that's	0
the	0
world's	0
worst	0
thing	1
so	0
let's	0
give	0
money	0
to	0
AIDS	1
and	0
yet	0
we've	0
had	0
breast	0
cancer	0
problems	0
for	0
years	1

right	1

and	1
it's	0
just	0
one	1
of	0
those	0
well	0
of	0
course	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
shows	1
i	0
saw	0
was	0
taking	0
it	0
from	1
the	0
angle	1
that	0
since	0
it	0
doesn't	0
effect	0
men	1
it's	0
not	0
gonna	0
get	0
funded	1
and	1
uh	0
having	0
thought	1
about	0
that	1
for	0
a	0
while	0

what	0
did	0
you	1
think	0
about	0
that	1
idea	0

well	1
i	1
i	0
kind	1
of	0
i	0
thought	1
well	1
that	0
that	1
might	0
be	0
possible	0
since	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
men	0
in	0
control	1
of	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
thing	1
but	0
then	0
i	0
go[t]	1
i	0
got	0
to	0
thinking	1
the	0
the	0
number	0
one	0
killer	0
of	0
men	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
prostate	1
and	0
there's	0
only	0
one	0
test	1
that	0
just	1
recently	1
got	0
developed	1
uh	0
a	0
blood	0
an[tigen]	1
antigen	1
uh	0
antibody	0
test	1
for	0
the	0
antigen	0
in	0
the	0
blood	1
and	0
that's	0
fairly	0
recent	1
and	0
yet	0
men	1
have	0
been	0
dying	0
from	0
prostate	0
cancer	0
for	0
years	1

they've	0
not	0
really	0
given	0
it	0
attention	1
either	1
yeah	1

so	1
it's	1
not	0
really	0
cure	0
f[or]	0
yeah	1
it's	1
not	0
uh	0
not	0
that	0
heavily	0
funded	0
either	1
and	0
that	1
seems	0
to	0
be	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
the	0
major	1
uh	0
problems	1
that	0
men	1
have	0
in	0
the	0
realm	0
of	0
cancer	0
so	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
guess	0
there's	0
just	0
some	0
strange	1
public	0
opinion	1
as	0
to	0
who	0
they	1
want	0
to	0
give	0
to	0
um	0
be	1
it	0
through	1
different	0
organizations	1
March	0
of	0
Dimes	0
type	1
uh	0
telethons	1
or	0
or	0
bicycle	1
rides	0
or	0
whatever	1
how	0
they	0
fund	1
whatever	1
um	0
illness	0
they	0
wish	1

right	1

it's	0
kind	0
of	0
hard	1
to	0
to	0
get	0
an	0
even	0
keel	1
on	0
that	1
i	0
mean	0
it's	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
say	1
well	1
there's	1
you	0
know	0
a	0
hundred	0
thousand	1
per	0
year	0
affected	0
by	0
this	1
one	0
so	0
let's	0
give	0
it	0
this	0
amount	1
and	0
then	0
this	0
other	0
one's	0
only	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	0
so	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
tenth	1
of	0
that	0
and	1
and	0
just	0
keep	1
doling	0
it	0
out	0
that	1
way	0
or	0

well	1
i'm	1
i'm	0
glad	0
i'm	0
not	1
the	0
one	0
that's	1
that's	1
in	0
charge	1
of	0
of	1
making	0
those	1
decisions	1
they	0
uh	1
you	0
wish	1
that	0
there	0
could	0
just	0
be	0
money	0
for	0
all	1
these	0
problems	1
because_1	0
they're	1
all	1
so	0
serious	1
you	1
know	0
i	0
mean	1
it's	0
not	0
so	0
serious	1
i	1
guess	1
until	1
it	0
affects	0
your	0
family	1
and	1
then	0
all	1
the	1
sudden	1
it's	0
the	0
most	1
important	0
thing	0

right	1

so	1
i	0
i	0
would	0
hate	1
to	0
have	0
that	0
responsibility	0
just	0
personally	1
but	1
but	0
then	0
again	1
we	0
really	1
we	0
really	0
do	1
have	0
it	1
as	1
a	1
society	1
just	0
decides	0
which	1
things	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
address	1
i	1
uh	1
i	0
guess	0
i	1
it	1
it	1
frightens	1
me	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
so	0
many	0
people	0
with	1
with	1
AIDS	0
and	1
with	1
cancer	1
and	1
many	1
of	0
those	0
things	0
um	0
if	0
they're	0
not	0
able	1
to	0
to	0
be	0
insured	1
then	0
the	0
country's	1
gonna	0
pay	0
for	1
it	0
one	1
way	1
or	0
the	0
other	1
whether	1
it's	0
through	0
prevention	1
or	0
or	1
treatment	1
or	1
you	1
know	1
just	1
uh	0
just	0
helping	1
the	0
people	1
when	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
able	1
to	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
themselves	1

right	1

it	0
seems	0
like	0
one	1
way	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
we're	0
gonna	0
end	0
up	0
paying	1
for	0
it	0

that's	0
true	1

just	1

you	0
know	1
the	1
the	0
other	1
thought	0
that	0
i	0
had	1
um	0
i've	0
had	1
several	0
minutes	0
to	0
think	1
about	0
this	0
after	1
i	0
uh	0
while	0
i	0
was	0
finding	1
people	0
i	1
uh	0
i	0
could	0
think	0
about	0
the	0
topic	1
longer	0
than	0
the	0
person	0
that	0
receives	1
it	0
so	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
a	0
a	0
unfair	0
advantage	1
as	0
they	0
were	0
but	0

but	0
the	0
other	0
thing	0
that	0
i've	0
thought	0
of	0
on	0
this	1
is	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
there	0
isn't	1
enough	0
money	1
uh	0
in	0
our	0
economy	1
or	0
in	0
our	0
system	0
uh	0
it	0
seems	1
like	0
there's	0
so	0
much	1
that	0
goes	1
to	0
things	0
that	0
don't	0
really	1
do	0
a	0
whole	1
lot	0
of	0
good	0
i	0
mean	1
yeah	1
they're	0
kind	0
of	0
nice	1
but	1
we	0
have	0
such	0
an	0
affluent	0
[s]ociety	1
society	1
that	0
i	0
wonder	1
if	0
if	0
we	1
took	0
a	0
little	1
from	0
here	0
and	0
there	0
and	0
the	0
other	0
if	0
we	0
might	1
wind	1
up	0
with	0
a	0
uh	0
cure	0
for	0
just	0
about	0
everything	1
of	0

just	1
change	1
our	0
p[riorities]	0

of	0
course	0
then	0
we	0
wouldn't	0
have	0
any	0
room	0
to	0
put	0
people	1
but	1
[laughter-that's]	0

right	1
just	1
change	0
our	0
priorities	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	1

yeah	1

you	0
know	0
you	0
hear	0
these	0
ridiculous	0
figures	0
for	0
pizza	1
or	0
you	0
hear	1
these	0
these	0
phenomenal	1
amount	0
of	0
dollars	1
spent	0
for	0
this	0
that	0
or	0
the	0
other	0
and	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
all	1
the	0
arts	1
that	0
that	0
are	0
nice	0
and	0
aesthetic	1
but	0
are	0
they	1
that	1
enhancing	0
for	0
the	1
m[asses]	0
for	0
the	1
masses	1
you	0
know	1
they	0

right	1

they	0
certainly	0
do	0
well	1
for	0
those	0
who	0
go	1
to	0
the	0
symphony	0
orchestra	0
and	0
all	0
that	1
but	0
uh	0
had	0
all	0
that	0
donation	1
and	0
time	1
and	0
labor	0
and	0
effort	1
gone	0
toward	0
something	0
else	1

okay	1
um	1
yeah	1
one	0
year	1
public	1
service	1
for	0
everybody	1
is	1
that	0
that	1
was	1
it	0
right	1

right	1
uh	1
who	1
wants	1
to	1
start	0
this	0
one	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
i've	0
been	0
i've	0
been	0
sitting	0
here	1
thinking	1
here	0
because	1
it	0
was	1
you	0
know	1
took	1
a	1
couple	1
tries	0
before	0
i	1
found	1
somebody	0
well	0
you	0
know	1
i'm	0
like	0
i'm	0
not	0
really	1
sure	1
what	1
i	0
think	0
about	0
this	0
um	1
uh	1
i	0
mean	1
the	0
first	1
thing	0
is	0
the	1
oh	0
if	0
it's	1
going	0
to	0
be	1
mandatory	1
it's	0
got	0
to	0
be	0
mandatory	1
i	0
mean	0
everybody	1
not	1
just	0
like	0
you	0
know	0
poor	1
people	0
and	0
all	1
that	1
you	1
know	0
but	0
you	0
know	0
senators'	0
sons	1
and	0
all	1
that	1
stuff	1
too	1
i	0

right	1
right	0

i	0
mean	0
everybody's	0
got	1
to	0
do	1
it	1
um	0
i	0
don't	1
know	1
it'd	1
probably	1
be	0
it'd	1
probably	0
be	1
good	1
i	0
just	1
don't	0
know	1
if	1
you	0
know	0
if	1
i	1
was	0
eighteen	1
or	0
whatever	0
i'd	1
want	1
to	0
be	0
stuck	0
doing	1
it	0
for	0
a	0
year	0
or	0
whatever	0

i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
i	0
want	0
an	0
eighteen	1
year	0
old	0
to	0
make	1
that	0
kind	0
of	0
decision	1
uh	0
i	0
mean	1
uh	1
that	0
that	0
doesn't	0
sound	1
right	0
um	1
i	0
guess	0
i	0
see	0
overall	0
beneficial	1
if	0
we're	0
if	0
we're	0
just	0
going	0
from	0
that	1
point	0
of	0
view	0

uh-huh	1

um	0
i	0
you	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
old	0
you	1
are	0
but	0
when	0
i	1
was	0
uh	1
in	1
high	0
school	1
was	0
uh	1
beginning	0
of	1
Vietnam	1
and	1
so	1
forth	0
and	1
many	0
of	0
my	0
peers	0
were	0
being	0
drafted	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
i	0
could	0
see	1
that	0
many	0
of	0
them	0
had	1
conscientious	0
objections	0
to	0
war	1
or	1
whatever	1
but	1
i	1
i	0
felt	1
strongly	0
then	1
that	1
even	0
if	1
they	0
didn't	0
feel	0
like	1
they	0
could	1
kill	1
someone	1
or	0
go	1
into	1
a	1
military	0
situation	1
that	1
that	1
they	0
could	1
help	0
the	0
country	0
in	0
other	1
ways	1
be	1
it	0
cleaning	1
out	1
uh	0
lots	1
in	0
in	1
their	0
neighborhood	1
or	0
whatever	0
kind	0
of	0
community	1
or	0
public	0
service	1
might	0
be	0
available	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	1
guess	0
i	0
see	1
that	1
as	0
as	0
not	1
so	0
much	1
a	0
a	0
demand	1
but	0
but	0
a	0
privilege	1
it's	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	0
uh	0
it's	0
something	1
i[t's]	0

yeah	1
is	0
um	0

it's	0
since	1
since	0
we	0
live	0
here	0
and	0
we	0
all	0
benefit	1
rich	0
poor	1
or	0
in	0
between	1
uh	0
there	0
are	0
benefits	0
even	0
for	0
those	0
who	0
have	0
it	0
the	0
hardest	1
i	0
just	0
see	0
that	1
as	0
maybe	1
a	0
good	0
idea	1
i	1
wouldn't	0
mind	0
doing	1
it	0
at	1
forty	0
four	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
find	0
ways	1
to	0
to	0
turn	0
some	0
of	0
that	0
back	1
to	0
to	0
others	1
uh	0
and	0
i	1
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	0
can't	0
see	0
that	0
as	0
being	1
something	0
to	0
really	0
object	1
to	1

well	0
i	0
guess	0
it's	1
going	0
to	0
depend	1
on	0
how	1
i	1
mean	0
if	0
if	0
you're	0
talking	1
about	0
any	1
if	0
you're	0
talking	0
about	0
something	1
that's	1
like	0
a	0
full	0
time	1
you	0
know	1
one	0
year	0
full	0
time	1
you	0
know	0
this	0
is	0
what	0
you	0
do	1
you	0
know	0
you're	1
going	1
to	0
go	1
and	0
and	1
fill	0
pot	0
holes	1
and	0
you	1
know	1
and	1
you	0
know	1
all	0
that	1
stuff	1
i	0
mean	0
i	1
you	0
know	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1

i	0
could	0
see	1
a	0
a	0
full	1
a	0
run	1
a	0
gamut	1
of	0
different	0
kinds	0
of	0
opportunities	1
things	0
that	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
done	1
that	0
wou[ld]	0
that	0
could	0
be	1
done	0
in	0
an	0
hour	1
or	0
two	0
uh	0
a	0
day	1
or	0
several	0
hours	0
of	0
the	0
week	0
like	0
a	0
half	0
of	0
a	0
day	0
on	0
Saturday	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	0
in	0
addition	0
to	0
what	0
one	0
does	1
uh	0
besides	1
that	0

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

i	0
i	0
can't	0
imagine	1
what	0
kind	0
of	0
uh	0
uh	0
bureaucracies	1
we'd	0
get	0
into	0
and	0
expense	1
having	1
it	0
be	0
full	0
time	1
oh	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
this	0
camp	1
and	0
you're	0
going	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
like	1
um	0
back	0
in	0
the	0
Depression	1
the	0
CCC	0
the	0
the	0
construction	0
corps	1
that	0
went	0
out	0
and	0
did	1
things	0
that	0
was	0
great	1
it	0

yeah	1

it	0
was	0
needed	1
it	0
gave	1
folks	1
some	0
jobs	1
and	0
we	0
got	0
some	0
great	0
public	0
works	1
out	0
of	0
it	0
but	1
um	1
i	0
don't	0
see	0
that	0
as	0
being	0
necessary	1
now	0
i	0
can	0
see	1
it	0
being	0
done	1
uh	0
on	0
a	0
regular	0
schedule	1

uh-huh	1

uh	0
everybody	0
has	0
to	0
put	0
in	0
so	0
many	0
hours	1
of	0
uh	0
public	0
service	1
in	0
a	0
given	0
time	1
perhaps	0

uh-huh	0

uh	0
i	0
i	0
guess	0
i	0
see	0
all	0
of	0
us	0
benefiting	1
and	0
i	1
i	0
don't	1
see	0
it	0
just	0
relegated	0
to	0
the	0
young	1
but	0
i	0
see	1
i	0
i	0
see	0
so	0
much	0
going	0
on	1
that	0
that's	0
bad	1
and	0
this	0
would	0
give	0
them	0
a	0
chance	1
to	0
have	0
some	0
positive	1
self	0
esteem	1
something	0

uh-huh	1

something	0
that	0
they	0
turn	0
back	1

well	0

and	0
also	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
you	0
feel	0
more	1
like	0
you	0
know	0
you're	1
actually	0
part	1
of	0
the	1
community	0
if	0
you've	0
done	1
something	0
in	0
it	0

that's	0
right	1

you	0
take	0
pride	1
in	0
that	0
and	0
and	0
get	1
some	0
some	0
positive	0
feedback	1
from	0
those	0
who	0
benefit	0
besides	1
yourself	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
i	1
i	0
see	0
it	0
being	0
most	0
beneficial	1
if	0
it's	0
in	0
the	0
neighborhood	1
where	0
or	0
or	0
at	0
least	0
the	0
area	0
where	0
the	0
person	0
lives	1
it	0

uh	0
definitely	1

it	0
may	1
not	0
be	0
the	0
same	0
neighborhood	1
but	0
the	0
same	0
city	0
or	0
county	1
because	0
then	1
you're	0
you're	0
coming	0
in	0
contact	1
with	0
it	0
it's	0
not	0
as	0
meaningful	1
for	0
me	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
Minnesota	1
and	0
do	0
something	0
up	0
there	0
that	0
i'll	0
never	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
see	1
again	0
unless	0
i	0
happen	0
to	0
go	0
on	0
vacation	1
up	1
there	0

right	1

yeah	1

it's	0
so	0
it	0
almost	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
has	0
more	1
impact	1
for	0
the	0
individual	1
on	0
going	1

yeah	1

but	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
putting	0
that	0
into	0
work	1
i	1
don't	0
want	0
to	0
i	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
deal	1
with	0
the	0
with	0
the	0
heartache	1
of	0
first	0
of	0
all	0
getting	0
it	0
started	1
and	0
figuring	0
out	0
how	0
to	0
do	0
the	0
logistics	1
yeah	0

oh	0
uh	0
that	0
would	1
be	0
a	1
nightmare	1

and	0
just	0
i	0
mean	0
just	0
getting	1
getting	0
it	0
going	1

yeah	0

yeah	0

i	0
i	0
see	1
a	0
lot	1
of	0
things	0
like	0
uh	0
scouting	1
uh	0
Boys	0
Clubs	0
Girls	1
Clubs	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
that	0
kind	1
of	0
get	0
into	0
that	0
citizenship	1
uh	0
the	0
uh	0
looking	0
after	0
the	0
environment	1
sort	0
of	0
thing	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
don't	0
see	0
uh	0
this	0
being	1
that	0
different	1
but	0
even	0
more	0
beneficial	1
because	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
everybody	1
participated	0
in	0
and	0
would	0
take	0
a	0
turn	1
in	0

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

do	0
you	0
have	0
kids	1

n[o]	0
uh	0
no	1
not	0
yet	0
about_1	0
six	0
months	1
we	0
will	0

oh	1
well	0
good	1
good	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
little	0
time	1
think	0
about	0
that	0
i	0
guess	1
i	0
i	1
have	0
uh	0
when	0
i	0
was	0
teaching	1
school	0
i	0
saw	1
many	0
ki[ds]	0
so	0
many	0
kids	0
that	0
were	0
at	0
loose	0
ends	1
and	1
that	0
didn't	0
really	0
have	0
a	0
purpose	1
and	0
i	0
can	0
see	1
you	1
know	0
some	0
some	0
really	1
significant	0
things	1
coming	0
out	0
of	0
it	0

uh-huh	1

i	0
know	1
you've	0
got	0
to	0
get	0
past	0
that	1
that	0
grudge	0
attitude	0
that	0
many	0
have	1
but	0
that's	1
uh	0
tha[t]	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
part	0
of	0
selling	1
it	0
to	0
the	0
community	1
to	0

uh-huh	1

the	0
adults	1
ahead	1
of	0
them	0
that	0
probably	0
would	0
never	0
serve	1
and	0
and	0
to	0
each	0
succeeding	0
generation	1
there'd	0
definitely	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
major	1
PR	0
campaign	1
in	0
each	0
community	0
each	0
county	1
uh	0
parish	1
or	0
however	1
the	0
state	1
was	0
divided	0
up	0

uh-huh	1

hum	1
i	0
may	0
well	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
around	0
here	1
we	0
have	0
a	0
number	0
of	0
community	0
projects	1
that	0
folks	0
just	0
volunteer	0
for	1
Boy	0
Scout	0
troops	1
or	0
church	0
groups	1
or	0
civic	0
clubs	1
will	0
uh	0
police	1
a	0
uh	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
miles	0
of	0
the	0
highway	1
and	1
kee[p]	0
and	1
i	0
i've	0
seen	0
it	0
in	0
other	0
states	0
too	1
i	1

yeah	0
they	0
have	0
that	0
here	1
um	0

i	1
don't	0
know	0

um	1

they've	0
got	1
um	0
in	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
states	1
around	0
here	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
you	0
know	0
down	0
in	0
North	0
Carolina	0
there	0
was	1
a	1
big	0
controversy	1
for	0
a	0
while	1
because_1	0
the	0
uh	1
the	0
local	0
chapter	0
of	0
the	0
KKK	1
wanted	0
to	0
uh	0
um	0
to	0
participate	1
in	0
it	0
and	1

and	1
uh	0
there	0
was	0
a	0

and	0
there	0
were	0
those	1
that	0
said	0
no	0
you	0
can't	0
do	1
that	0
i'm	0
sure	1

yeah	1
well	1
uh	0
it	0
was	0
it	0
was	0
interesting	1
because	0
that's	0
an	0
interesting	0
question	1
you	0
know	0
should	0

yeah	0

should	0
these	0
people	0
be	0
allowed	0
to	0
or	1
not	1
i	0
think	1
they	0
finally	0
decided	0
not	1
to	0
because	0
they	0
figured	1
that	0
stretch	0
of	0
highway	1
was	0
going	0
to	1
get	0
trashed	1

oh	1
and	0
i	0
hadn't	0
even	0
thought	1
about	0
that	0
uh	0
the	0
oth[er]	1
the	0
other	0
end	1
of	0
that	0
that	1
that's	0
an	0
interesting	1
uh	0
situation	1
i	0
hadn't	0
thought	1
of	0
that	0
we	0
had	0
visited	1
relatives	0
in	0
Virginia	1
not	0
too	0
long	1
ago	0
and	0
i	0
thought	0
i	0
had	0
seen	1
when	0
we	0
were	0
traveling	0
around	0
the	0
state	1
some	0
similar	0
signs	1
up	0
that	0
indicated	1
that	0
certain	0
sections	0
were	0
being	0
policed	1
and	0
cleaned	0
up	1
and	0

yeah	0
i	0
think	0
Virginia's	1
got	0
it	0
and	0
i	0
know	0
Maryland	1
does	0
and	0
we	1
just	0
we	0
went	0
to	0
Indianapolis	1
last	0
weekend	0
and	0
back	1
and	0
um	0
i'm	0
pretty	0
sure	0
i	0
saw	1
yeah	0
stuff	0
in	0
Ohio	1
and	0
Indi[ana]	0
Indiana	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
Pennsylvania	1
maybe	0
Pennsylvania	1
i	0
don't	0
remember	0
for	0
sure	1
now	0

and	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
about	0
your	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1
but	0
uh	1
down	0
here	0
in	0
the	0
last	1
y[ear]	0
oh	0
year	0
plus	1
i	0
it	0
was	0
las[t]	1
beginning	0
with	0
last	0
year's	0
Earth	0
Day	1
there's	0
just	0
been	0
more	1
of	0
a	0
turn	0
toward	1
uh	0
environmental	0
concerns	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
e[ven]	0
i	0
work	0
for	0
Texas	0
Instruments	1
and	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
they	0
they've	0
started	1
some	0
recycling	0
campaigns	1
that	0
a	0
year	0
before	0
that	1
had	0
been	0
turned	0
down	1
because_1	0
they	0
said	0
well	0
it's	0
not	0
feasible	1
it's	0

uh-huh	1

it's	0
not	1
a	0
good	0
idea	0
and	1
i	0
see	0
that	1
as	0
being	0
i	1
i	0
see	0
that	1
as	0
being	0
a	0
a	0
a	0
change	1
um	0
it	0
for	0
the	0
positive	1
kind	0
of	0
along	0
the	0
same	1
line	0
as	0
as	0
as	0
the	0
mandatory	1
thing	0
it's	0

yeah	0
and	0
but	0
then	0
they	0
lost	0
too	0
much	0
business	1

it's	0
just	0
thing	1
a	0
part	0
of	0
everyone's	0
consciousness	1

uh-huh	1
well	1
the	0
thing	0
about	0
that	1
is	0
though	0
it's	0
got	1
a	0
i	0
mean	1
because	0
it	0
was	0
i	0
mean	0
it	0
was	0
big	1
you	0
remember	1
like	0
in	0
the	0
early	0
seventies	1
and	0
all	0
that	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	0
it	0
kind	0
of	0
just	0
went	0
out	0
of	0
vogue	1
and	1
i	0
i'm	0
worried	1
that	0
it	0
it	1
might	0
you	0
know	0
it'll	0
it	1
the	0
same	0
thing	0
will	0
happen	1
it's	0
like	0
you	0
know	0
environmentalism	0
was	0
really	0
big	1
for	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	0
and	0
then	0
people	0
like	0
well	1
you	0
know	0
i'd	0
rather	0
rather	0
spend	1
you	0
know	0
fifty	0
cents	0
less	1
on	0
uh	0
on	0
on	0
such	0
and	0
such	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
even	0
if	0
it's	0
not	0
environmentally	0
safe	0
who	0
cares	1
you	0
know	0

i'm	0
sure	0
the	0
pendulum	1
will	0
swing	0
the	0
other	0
way	1
uh	0
there	0
have	0
been	0
too	0
many	0
other	1
things	0
that	0
it's	0
done	1
that	0
for	0
just	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
look	0
at	0
history	1
at	0
all	0
you	0
see	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
uh	0
we	1
go	0
from	0
one	0
side	0
to	0
the	0
other	1
on	0
just	0
about	0
any	0
subject	1
that	0
you	0
one	0
might	0
care	1
to	0
bring	0
up	1

yeah	0

but	1
it	0
is	0
comforting	1
to	0
me	0
to	0
see	1
uh	0
more	0
concern	1
about	0
some	0
of	0
these	0
things	0
that	0
that	0
cost	0
us	0
money	1
especially	0
when	0
we	0
have	0
dwindling	1
uh	0
resources	1
such	0
as	0
oil	1
that's	0
burning	1
out	0
of	0
control	1
in	0
[laughter-in]	0
the	0
Persian	0
Gulf	1
and	0
and	0
so	1
forth	0
just	0
just	0
every	0
little	0
bit	1
does	1
it	0
makes	0
me	0
feel	1
better	0
it	0
it	0
makes	0
me	0
feel	1
like	0
well	1
there	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
left	1
for	0
my	1
children	0
my	0
nieces	0
and	0
nephews	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0

well	0
yeah	1
uh	0
uh	1
well	0
wouldn't	0
it's	0
just	0
probably	0
a	0
good	0
thing	0
that	0
the	0
oil's	0
burning	1
and	0
may	0
may	1
make	0
some	0
people	0
realize	0
that	0
hey	1
you	0
know	0
this	0
stuff	0
runs	0
out	1

that's	0
that's	0
right	1
because	1

of	0
course	1
that's	0
probably	0
blasphemy	1
for	0
you	0
to	0
say	0
uh	0
coming	1
from	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
Texas	1

uh	0
no	1
no	1
because	1
if	0
we	1
what	1
was	0
it	0
in	0
seventy	0
four	1
when	0
we	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
last	0
last	0
oil	0
crisis	1
an[d]	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
started	0
getting	0
smart	1
and	0
and	0
we	0
were	0
looking	0
all	0
these	0
alternative	0
sources	1
of	0
energy	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
as	0
soon	1
as	0
the	0
oil	0
prices	0
came	0
back	0
down	1
we	0
the	0
pendulum	0
swung	1
the	0
other	0
way	1

right	1

and	1
we	1
need	1
those	0
reminders	1

yeah	1

uh	0
or	0
we'll	0
suddenly	0
be	0
in	0
the	0
dark	1
and	0
say	0
oh	0
my	0
goodness	1
now	1
we	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
ability	1
to	0
go	0
on	0
to	0
some	0
new	1
technology	0

right	0
well	0
my	0
dad's	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
solar	0
energy	0
business	1
so	1
um	0
you	0
know	0
we're	1
acutely	0
aware	1
of	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
this	0
but	1

ah	1

but	1
[laughter-you]	0
know	0
on	0
the	0
other	0
hand	0
he	0
voted	0
for	0
George	0
Bush	1
so	0
um	0
you	0
know	1
i	0
i	0
wonder	1
sometimes	0
if	0
he	1
knows	0
what	0
he's	0
doing	0

well	1
i	0
thi[s]	0
you	0
know	0
just	0
about	0
anybody	0
you	0
could	0
name	1
whether	0
i	0
voted	0
for	0
them	0
or	0
not	1
uh	0
makes	1
um	0
uh	0
decisions	0
that	0
i	0
just	0
can't	1
go	0
along	0
with	0

uh-huh	1

but	1
uh	0
that's	0
why	0
they're	0
there	0
and	0
not	1
me	0
i	1
don't	0
want	0
the	0
i	0
don't	0
want	0
the	0
[laughter-stress]	1
and	0

yeah	1

well	1
the	0
the	0
thing	0
with	0
Bush	1

i	1
don't	1
know	1
what	0
the	1
the	1
last	1
thing	0
i've	1
done	1
far	1
as	0
car	0
repairs	0
go	1
is	0
is	0
change	1
oil	1
and	1
filter	1
an	1
and	1
that	0
kind	0
of	1
stuff	1
i	0
haven't	0
gotten	1
really	1
involved	0
in	1
anything	1
uh	1
extensive	1
in	1
car	1
repairs	1
in	1
oh	0
oh	1
probably	0
a	1
year	1
or	1
so	0
i	1
think	0
the	1
last	1
thing	0
i	1
did	0
of	1
any	1
significance	1
was	1
change	1
the	0
water	1
pump	0
on	0
an	0
Oldsmobile	1

yeah	1
i	1
had	1
a	0
similar	0
thing	1
that	0
i've	1
worked	0
on	0
cars	1
ever	0
since	0
i	0
was	1
uh	0
a	0
kid	1
and	1
that	0
was	1
some	0
time	0
ago	1
but	0
i've	0
gotten	0
to	1
the	0
point	1
where	0
uh	1
the	0
newer	0
cars	1
are	0
getting	1
so	0
complicated	0
to	0
work	1
on	0
that	1
uh	1
oh	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
cars	1
i	0
buy	1
i	0
try	0
to	0
buy	1
as	0
simple	0
a	0
car	0
as	1
possible	1

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
what	0
you	1
mean	0

so	0
you	0
know	0
changing	0
the	0
oil	1
changing	0
the	0
spark	0
plugs	1
and	1
most	0
of	1
them	0
now	1
you	0
know	1
you	0
don't	1
go	0
through	0
the	1
ignition	0
stuff	0
anymore	1
because	1
that's	0
all	0
solid	0
state	1
or	0
or	0
fuel	0
injected	1
so	0

yeah	0
they're	0
fuel	1
injected	0
and	0
so	1
there's	1

so	0
there	0
goes	0
the	0
carburetor	0
and	0
if	0
the	0
fuel	0
injection	0
system	0
breaks	0
down	1
there's	0
no	0
way	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
you're	0
going	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
that	1

yeah	0

no	0
there's	0
no	0
way	0
somebody	0
once	1
said	0
uh	0
i	0
had	1
a	0
car	0
that	0
said	1
fuel	0
injection	0
on	0
the	0
side	0
of	0
it	1
and	0
a	1
woman	0
asked	1
me	1
what	1
that	1
meant	1
and	1
i	1
said	1
that	1
means	1
that	1
i	0
can't	1
work	1
on	0
it	1

oh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
basically	0
that's	0
it	0

you	0
know	1
they've	1
gotten	0
so	0
complicated	1
or	1
so	0
high	1
tech	1
that	0
uh	1
the	1
guys	1
average	0
guys	1
can't	0
really	1
go	1
out	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	1
garage	1
and	1
do	0
a	1
whole	0
lot	0
of	1
repairs	1
uh	0

yeah	0
i've	0
got	1
uh	0
an	0
eighty	0
four	0
Chevy	0
van	1
that's	1
uh	0
a	0
one	0
ton	0
van	1
with	0
a	0
camper	0
conversion	1
on	0
it	0

yeah	0

it's	0
got	1
the	0
the	1
the	0
good	0
old	0
three	0
fifty	1
standard	0
engine	1
in	0
it	0

absolutely	0

regular	0
gas	0
engine	0
and	0
that	0
engine	0
i	0
understand	1
i	0
can	1
i	0
can	0
actually	0
work	1
on	0
that	0
engine	0

yeah	0
i	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
uh	0
Chevy	0
van	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
short	1
van	0
that	0
had	1
the	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	1
in	0
it	0

yeah	0

uh-hum	0

and	0
basically	1
it	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
motor	1
and	0
you	0
didn't	0
have	0
all	0
the	1
other	0
junk	0
around	1
it	0

right	0

and	1
you	0
could	0
get	0
to	1
it	1
to	1
work	1
on	0
it	0

yeah	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
change	0
the	0
water	0
pump	0
in	0
that	1
here	0
about	0
a	0
year	1
ago	0
and	0
it	0
was	0
really	0
fairly	0
easy	1
take	0
the	0
grill	0
out	1
and	0
the	0
radiator	0
out	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
just	0
stand	0
there	0
and	0
work	1
on	1
it	0

yeah	0
the	0
hardest	1
part	0
about	0
uh	0
water	0
pump	0
changes	1
is	0
getting	0
all	0
the	0
junk	1
off	0
before	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
too	1
it	0

well	1
that's	0
true	0
that	0
you're	0
right	0
you	0
know	0
by	0
the	0
time	0
you've	0
finally	0
got	0
down	0
to	0
it	1
i	0
was	0
hoping	0
i	0
could	0
remember	0
where	0
all	0
those	0
other	1
things	0
went	1

well	0
that's	0
kind	0
of	1
the	0
way	0
i	0
was	1
i	0
tried	1
to	0
remember	0
as	0
i	1
took	0
stuff	0
off	1
where	0
it	0
went	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
i	0
had	0
too	0
many	0
nuts	0
and	0
bolts	0
left	1
over	1
when	1
i	0
got	0
it	0
all	0
put	0
back	0
together	1

a	0
few	0
years	0
ago	0
i	0
had	0
an	0
Oldsmobile	0
diesel	1
and	0
uh	0
the	0
uh	0
it	0
after	0
about	0
a	0
hundred	0
thousand	0
miles	1
the	0
injector	0
pump	0
went	0
out	1
on	0
it	0
and	1
uh	0
i	1
bought	0
it	0
when	0
we	0
were	0
living	0
in	0
Lubbock	1
when	0
i	0
came	0
back	0
here	1
i	0
brought	0
the	0
car	0
back	0
here	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
diesels	0
got	0
pretty	0
unpopular	0
and	0
you	0
couldn't	0
sell	1
the	0
thing	0
i	0
mean	0
though	0
for	1
what	0
you	0
could	0
get	0
for	0
one	1
you	0
might	0
as	0
well	0
drive	0
it	0
over	0
a	0
cliff	1

oh	0
yeah	0
yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
the	0
injector	0
pump	0
went	0
bad	0
so	0
i	1
found	1
an	0
outfit	0
down	0
here	0
to	0
rebuild	1
it	0
and	1
uh	0
i	1
reinstalled	0
that	1
and	0

and	0
that	0
was	0
probably	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
miserable	1
things	0
i	0
had	0
gotten	0
into	0
in	0
a	0
long	0
time	1

i	0
don't	0
think	1
i'd	0
know	0
where	1
to	0
start	0
with	0
a	0
diesel	1

uh	0
well	0
if	0
you	0
know	0
diesels	0
don't	0
require	0
mechanics	1
they	0
require	0
plumbers	0

well	0
that's	0
true	0

and	0
uh	0

i	0
think	0
the	0
onl[y]	1
closest	0
thing	1
i've	0
come	1
to	0
to	0
a	0
diesel	1
is	0
i've	1
worked	1
for	0
a	0
tractor	0
repair	0
shop	1
uh	1
when	0
i	0
was	1
in	0
high	1
school	0
and	0
uh	0
we	0
used	1
to	0
overhaul	1
farm	0
tractors	0
basically	1

yeah	0

and	0
they	0
were	0
nearly	0
all	1
all	0
diesel	1
but	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
cars	1
i've	0
never	1
never	0
been	0
involved	1
with	0
them	0

well	0
the	0
injector	1
nozzle	1
and	0
stuff	0
in	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
big	1
diesel	0
farm	0
tractors	1
you	0
know	1
what	0
are	0
about	0
the	0
size	0
of	0
your	1
thumb	1
and	1
the	0

well	0
ye[ah]	0
yeah	0
and	0
you	1
ca[n]	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
to	1
them	0

yeah	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
to	0
them	1
and	0
the	0
ones	1
in	0
in	0
the	0
diesel	0
cars	1
were	0
little	0
tiny	0
things	1
and	0
just	0
almost	0
impossible	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
with	0

well	0
i	0

i've	0
had	0
a	1
lot	0
of	0
good	0
service	0
out	0
of	0
that	1
car	1
but	0
uh	0
uh	1
i	0
finally	0
gave	0
it	0
to	0
my	1
son	1
and	0
he	1
drove	0
it	0
literally	0
into	0
the	0
ground	1
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

yeah	0

he	0
was	0
out	0
at	0
Tech	1
and	0
he	1
he	0
finished	0
it	0
off	1

i'm	0
i	0
guess	0
you're	0
right	0
the	0
the	0
diesel	0
has	0
almost	0
fallen	0
into	1
unpopular	0
status	1
i	0
don't	1
know	0
exactly	0
why	1
One	0
of	0
the	0
reasons	0
is	0
i	1
i'm	1
beginning	0
to	0
wonder	1
is	0
where	0
do	0
you	0
get	0
gas	1
at	0
i	0
su[re]	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
still	1
uh	0
limited	1
like	0
it	0
was	1
i	0
don't	1
notice	1
it	0
probably	1
because	0
i	1
don't	0

what	0
the	0
availability	0

huh	0

you	0
mean	0
the	0
diesel	0
availability	0

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
don't	0
notice	0
but	0
maybe	0
because	0
i'm	0
not	0
looking	1
for	0
it	0

yeah	0
well	0
i'd	0
bought	1
uh	0
a	0
GMC	1
diesel	0
pickup	1
and	1
uh	0
loved	1
that	0
thing	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
really	0
liked	0
it	0
but	0
it	0
turns	0
out	0
a	0
pickup	0
wasn't	0
what	0
i	0
really	1
needed	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
was	0
the	0
van	1
that	0
i	0
needed	0
then	0
to	0
buying	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
traded	0
it	0
in	0
on	0
the	0
Chevy	0
van	1
but	1
uh	0
i	0
sure	0
enjoyed	1
it	0

but	0
you	0
you	0
got	1
the	0
you	0
got	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	0
in	0
the	0
van	1

yeah	0
yeah	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	0
regular	0
gas	0
engine	0

yeah	0
that's	0
what	0
i	0
like	0
because	1
they've	0
got	0
plenty	0
of	0
power	1
and	0
uh	0
if	0
you	0
treat	0
them	0
right	0
they're	0
not	1
the	0
gas	0
guzzlers	1
i	0
think	0
that	0
they've	1
got	0
the	0
reputation	0
to	0
be	1

uh-huh	0

i'm	0
convinced	1
that	0
uh	0
Detroit	0
or	0
whoever	1
it	0
is	0
made	0
a	0
major	0
mistake	0
years	1
ago	0
when	0
they	0
stopped	0
putting	0
the	0
small	1
V	0
eights	1
in	0
and	0
went	1
to	0
the	1
fours	1
and	0
some	1
of	1
the	0
sixes	1

yeah	0
well	0

i'm	0
convinced	1
that	0
the	0
small	1
V	0
eight	1
like	0
the	0
the	0
Mustang's	0
original	0
two	0
eighty	1
nine	1
or	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
Chevy	0
two	1
eighty	0
threes	1
were	0
good	0
little	1
V	0
eight	0
engines	1
that	0
were	0
not	0
gas	0
guzzlers	1
but	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
they	0
had	0
enough	1
power	1
to	1
pull	0
all	0
this	1
weight	1

yeah	0

And	0
the	1
four	0
cylinders	0
just	1
don't	1
have	1
it	1

think	0
that	1
little	1
the	0
little	0
Chevy	0
V	0
eight	0
when	1
it	0
started	1
out	0
in	0
sixty	0
in	0
fifty	0
five	1
i	0
think	0
was	0
two	0
sixty	0
five	1
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

little	0
you	0
know	0
not	0
a	0
hold	0
lot	0
more	0
than	0
the	0
than	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	0
that	0
i	0
think	0
was	0
like	1
about	0
for	0
about	0
two	0
thirty	0
five	1
or	0
something	0
but	0
uh	0
they	1
kept	0
boring	0
that	0
block	0
out	0
to	0
where	1
you	0
could	0
a	0
get	0
a	0
four	0
hundred	1
small	0
block	0
four	0
hundred	0
that	0
was	1
uh	0
the	0
same	0
block	1
you	0
know	1
just	1
just	0
kept	0
boring	0
it	0
out	1
and	0
boring	0
it	0
out	1
and	0
stroking	0
it	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
more	1
yeah	0

i	1
think	0
those	1
g[uys]	0
those	0
little	0
V	0
eights	1
could	0
have	0
been	1
made	1
to	0
be	0
pretty	0
powerful	0
little	0
engines	1
if	0
they	0
would	0
have	0
gone	0
with	1
it	0
but	0

well	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
short	0
stroke	0
engine	1
it	0
could	0
really	0
wind	0
up	1

oh	1
yeah	0

the	0
two	0
little	0
cars	0
i've	0
got	0
now	1
bought	0
a	0
Mitsubishi	0
Mirage	0
here	0
a	0
couple	0
years	0
ago	1
and	0
and	0
it	0
was	1
normally	0
carbureted	1
and	0
it's	0
fairly	1
easy	0
to	0
to	0
work	0
with	0
because	0
there's	0
not	0
just	0
a	0
whole	0
lot	1
in	0
it	0
to	0
go	0
wrong	1
and	0
you	0
know	0
changing	0
the	0
plugs	0
and	0
stuff	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
that's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	1

the	0
the	0
first	1
well	0
my	0
first	0
car	0
was	0
a	0
fifty	0
six	0
Mustang	1
and	0
uh	0
over	0
the	0
years	0
uh	0
all	0
i	0
had	1
a	0
uh	0
Dodge	1
pickup	1
several	0
years	0
ago	1
and	0
uh	0
i	0
can't	0
remember	0
the	0
size	0
of	0
the	0
engine	1
it	0
was	0
a	0
three	0
O	1
seven	1
or	0
something	0
like	0
that	1

yeah	0

but	0
uh	0
i	0
remember	0
working	0
on	0
those	0
cars	1
you'd	0
open	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
there	0
was	0
basically	0
nothing	0
in	1
there	0
but	0
an	0
engine	1
and	0
a	0
few	0
things	1

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

Now	1
you	0
open	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
it's	0
scary	0

yeah	0

like	0
you	0
say	1
it	0
takes	0
a	0
plumber	1
to	0
figure	0
out	0
where	0
all	0
this	0
stuff	0
goes	1

the	0
friend	0
of	0
ours	0
over	0
here	0
he's	0
got	1
uh	0
sixty	0
five	1
or	0
sixty	0
six	0
Mustang	1
with	0
the	0
six	0
cylinder	1

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
i	0
was	0
look	0
under	0
the	0
hood	0
of	0
that	0
the	0
other	0
day	1
and	1
like	0
you	1
say	0
you	0
can	0
see	0
the	0
road	1

yeah	0

it's	0
amazing	0

well	0
if	0
you	0
had	1
to	0
you	0
could	1
climb	0
up	0
in	1
there	0
and	1
do	0
what	0
you	0
needed	1
to	0

you	0
could	1
yeah	1
you	0
could	0
stand	0
in	0
there	0
if	0
you	0
really	0
wanted	1
to	0
i	0
guess	1

my	0
dad's	0
got	0
a	0
new	1
um	0
i	0
guess	0
it's	0
an	0
eighty	0
nine	0
or	0
ninety	1
uh	0
Chrysler	1
something	1
or	0
other	0
it's	0
one	0
those	0
transverse	0
mounted	1
V	0
sixes	1
front	0
wheel	0
drive	1

oh	0
yeah	0

and	0
uh	1
he	0
was	0
showing	0
it	0
to	0
me	1
and	0
we're	0
looking	0
under	0
the	0
hood	1
and	0
everything's	0
nice	0
and	0
clean	0
and	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
can	0
see	0
the	0
three	0
spark	0
plugs	0
there	0
in	0
the	0
front	1
And	0
i	0
said	0
well	0
where	0
are	0
the	0
other	1
three	0

and	1
he	0
had	0
never	0
really	0
thought	1
about	0
it	0

yeah	0

And	0
he	0
says	0
well	0
hopefully	0
i	0
won't	0
have	0
to	0
change	1
them	0
before	0
i	0
trade	1
it	0
off	1
Yeah	0
it's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
problem	0
getting	0
back	1
there	0
because	0
it	0
was	1
shoved	0
right	0
up	0
against	0
the	0
fire	0
wall	1

yeah	0

so	0
they	0
just	0
about	0
complicated	0
the	0
things	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
shade	0
tree	0
mechanics	0
can't	0
do	0
much	1
with	1
them	0

yeah	0
well	0
when	0
they	0
went	0
to	0
the	1
started	0
with	0
the	0
newer	0
engines	1
you	0
know	0
when	0
they	0
started	0
putting	0
all	0
that	0
pollution	0
control	0
stuff	0
on	0
the	0
older	0
engines	0
is	0
where	0
they	0
started	0
getting	0
into	0
so	0
much	0
you	1
know	0
trouble	0
because	0
the	0
three	0
fifty	1
with	0
all	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
like	0
well	0
actually	0
i	0
guess	0
here	0
within	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
years	0
ago	0
anyway	0
was	0
the	0
last	0
i've	0
paid	0
any	0
attention	1
to	0
it	0
the	0
three	0
O	0
five	0
was	0
that	1
that	0
V	0
eight	1
that	0
they	0
put	0
in	0
the	1
the	0
three	0
quarter	1
and	0
and	0
half	0
ton	0
van	1
and	0

right	0

and	0
it	0
had	0
all	0
the	0
air	0
pump	1
and	0
uh	0
uh	0
i	0
don't	1
know	0
all	1
that	0
all	0
that	0
stuff	1

right	0

yeah	0
the	0
antismog	0
pumps	0

and	0
all	0
the	0
antismog	0
stuff	0
and	0
uh	0
boy	0
that	1
was	0
uh	0
really	0
a	0
mess	0
back	0
under	0
there	1
under	0
the	1
in	0
that	0
van	1

and	0
all	0
that	0
stuff	0
loads	1
the	0
motor	1
down	0

uh-huh	0
uh-huh	0

so	0
it's	0
trying	0
to	0
push	0
the	0
weight	1
plus	0
have	0
all	0
this	0
drain	1
on	0
it	0
from	0
all	0
sorts	1
of	0
belts	0
and	0
things	1
but	0
that's	0
one	0
good	0
thing	1
i've	0
got	1
a	0
uh	0
eight	0
ninety	1
uh	0
Chevy	0
Blazer	0
now	1
and	0
it's	0
got	0
one	1
uh	0
belt	1
on	0
it	0
a	0
serpentine	0
belt	1

oh	1
it's	0
that	1
one	0
that's	0
about	1
uh	0
what	0
an	0
inch	0
and	0
a	0
half	0
wide	1
got	0

yeah	0

got	0
a	0
bunch	0
of	0
groves	0
in	0
it	0

i	0
haven't	0
had	0
to	0
replace	0
the	0
thing	0
yet	1
it	0
looks	0
like	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
uh	0
better	0
than	0
having	0
i've	0
got	1
an	1
an	0
Olds	0
Tornado	1
that	0
i	0
think's	1
got	0
six	0
belts	0
on	0
the	1
sucker	1

yeah	0

And	0
i	0
had	1
to	0
get	0
all	0
those	0
off	1
you	0
know	0
when	1
i	0
was	0
replace	0
that	0
uh	0
water	1
pump	0

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
i	0
had	0
to	1
struggle	0
with	0
that	1
for	0
a	0
while	0
to	0
figure	0
which	0
belt	0
goes	0
where	1

yeah	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
like	0
the	0
inside	0
dual	0
on	0
a	0
truck	1
you	0
know	0
when	0
one	0
of	0
them	0
breaks	1
it's	0
not	0
the	0
outside	1
one	0
it's	1

oh	0
man	0

it's	1
it's	0
the	1
it's	0
usually	0
that	0
power	1
steering	0
belt	0
or	0
something	1
that's	0
way	0
back	0
in	0
there	1

you	0
bet	0
everything	0
else's	0
got	0
to	0
come	0
off	0
first	1

everything's	0
got	0
to	0
come	0
off	1

well	1
it's	0
a	0
pleasure	0
meeting	0
you	1

yeah	0
and	0
we'll	0
uh	0
how	0
many	0
times	0
have	0
you	0
done	0
this	0
now	1
is	0
this	0

uh	0
i've	0
got	1
uh	1
five	0
stickers	0
here	1
from	0
TI	1
so	1
i	0
guess	0
i've	0
done	1
probably	1
uh	1
i'd	0
say	0
seven	0
or	0
eight	1
of	0
them	0

yeah	0
i	0
hadn't	1
uh	0
hadn't	1
not	0
gotten	0
any	0
calls	0
here	0
in	0
the	0
last	1
uh	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
first	0
one	0
in	0
a	0
week	0
or	0
so	1

yeah	0
i	0
haven't	0
gotten	0
any	0
calls	0
in	0
two	1
weeks	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
if	1
if	0
it's	0
tapering	0
off	1
or	0
or	0
what	1

if	0
it's	0
winding	0
down	0
or	0
what	1

i	0
had	0
a	0
difficult	0
time	1
the	0
past	0
couple	0
of	0
times	0
of	0
getting	1
uh	0
answers	1

finding	0
a	0
taker	0

so	0
it	0
sounds	0
it's	1
taken	0
them	0
ten	0
fifteen	0
minutes	0
at	0
a	0
time	1
so	1
people	0
or	0
either	0
not	1
or	0
maybe	0
they're	0
burned	0
out	0
or	0

yeah	0

well	0

anyway	0
let	0
you	0
go	0
thanks	0
for	0
talking	0

okay	0
all	0
righty	0
bye-bye	0

okay	1
what	1
do	1
you	0
think	1
about	1
it	1

well	1
uh	1
the	1
roles	0
have	0
definitely	0
changed	1
in	0
the	0
last	0
generation	1
or	0
so	0

oh	0
yeah	1

um	1
i	1
i	0
think	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
it	1
has	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
women	0
working	1

uh-huh	1
yeah	1
i	0
do	0
too	1
i	1
think	0
it's	1
going	1
to	0
in	1
like	0
in	1
the	1
future	1
i	0
think	1
all	0
women	0
are	1
going	0
to	0
work	1

yeah	0

i	1
mean	1
they	1
may	0
let	0
you	0
off	0
for	0
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	0
to	0
have	1
your	0
baby	1
but	1
that	0
will	0
be	0
it	1

yeah	0

or	1
either	0
they'll	1
have	0
a	1
computer	0
at	1
home	1
and	0
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
where	1
you	0
can	0
just	1
you	1
know	0
just	0
continue	0
right	1
on	1
with	0
your	1
work	1

ye[ah]	0
yeah	1

i	0
mean	1
i[t]	1
it	1
really	0
is	1
coming	0
to	0
that	1
because	0
most	0
women	1
now	1
days	1
cannot	0
afford	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
they	0
could	0
take	1
off	1
unless	0
the	1
company	1
pays	1
them	0

right	1
right	0

they	0
can't	0
even	0
afford	1
to	0
take	0
off	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
have	0
children	1
it	0
seems	1
like	0

and	1
it	1
and	0
it	1
seems	1
if	1
you're	0
going	0
to	1
have	0
kids	1
uh	1
that	1
you	0
are	1
you	0
know	0
society	0
has	0
decided	0
for	1
you	0
how	1
many	0
you	1
can	1
really	1
have	1
and	1
make	1
it	0

yeah	1

and	0
uh	0
because	0
if	0
you	0
have	1
you	1
know	0
two	1
well	0
if	0
you	0
go	0
to	0
work	1
you're	0
just	0
working	0
to	0
pay	1
for	0
day	1
care	1
two	0
or	0
three	1
you	1
know	0
um	0

right	1

now	0
i	0
was	0
real	0
lucky	1
because	0
my	0
husband	0
had	0
a	0
good	0
enough	0
job	1
where	0
when	0
my	0
kids	1
were	0
you	0
know	0
when	1
i	0
had	0
them	1
and	0
when	0
they	0
were	1
small	1
until	0
they	0
got	0
in	0
junior	1
high	1
school	0
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
got	0
in	0
junior	1
high	0
i	0
didn't	0
have	1
to	0
work	1

uh-huh	1

oh	1
that	0
is	1
good	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
didn't	1
work	0
i	1
i	0
needed	1
to	0
but	0
i	0
didn't	1

yeah	0
Steve's	1
Steve	0
has	0
a	0
sister	0
who	1
has	0
four	1
she	0
just	0
had	0
her	0
fourth	1
one	1
in	1
uh	0
March	1
and	1
she	0
doesn't	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
either	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
i	1
don['t]	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
people	0
do	0
it	0
with	0
one	1
you	1
know	1
um	1
obviously	0

let	0
me	1
tell	1
you	0
you	0
go	0
without	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
things	1
that	0
you	0
wou[ld]	0
you	1
know	0

yeah	1
obviously	0
we	1
don't	0
have	1
any	1
and	0
and	0
i	1
don't	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
part	1
of	1
the	0
role	0
reversal	0
is	0
it's	0
okay	1
to	0
get	0
married	1
and	1
not	0
have	0
kids	1

oh	0
yeah	1

and	0
i	1
think	1
for	0
society	1
for	0
such	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
said	0
well	1
you	1
know	1
you're	0
married	1
now	1
you	1
need	0
to	0
se[t]	0
have	0
have	0
your	0
family	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
think	1
it's	0
been	0
until	1
recently	1
that	0
that	0
they	1
had	1
decided	1
that	0
two	1
people	0
was	1
a	1
family	0

right	1
right	0

you	0
know	0
and	0

well	1
it's	1
getting	1
where	0
you	0
can't	0
hardly	0
afford	1
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
give	1
your	0
kids	1
any	0
kind	0
of	0
education	1
and	0
stuff	0
you	0
can't	0
hardly	0
afford	1
to	0
have	1
over	0
two	1

right	1

and	0
i	1
mean	0
it's	0
hard	0
with	1
two	1
now	0
we	1
uh	0
my	1
youngest	1
one	0
i	0
have	0
two	1
i	0
have	1
a	0
son	0
and	0
a	0
daughter	1
and	1
my	0
youngest	1
one	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
graduating	0
from	0
college	1
soon	0

oh	1

but	0
if	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
third	1
one	0
i	0
just	0
don't	0
know	0
where	0
it	0
would	0
come	1
from	0

[laughter-yeah]	0

yeah	0

because	1
i	0
work	0
now	1
i	1
work	0
full	1
time	1
and	0
uh	0
you	0
know	1
it	0
when	1
you	0
put	0
them	0
through	0
college	1
it	0
just	0
takes	0
just	0
about	1
everything	0
you	0
got	1

yeah	1

they	0
get	0
loans	1
and	0
grants	1
and	0
scholarships	1
and	1
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
that	0
helps	0
out	1
but	0
still	1
it	0
cost	0
a	0
lot	1

oh	0
yeah	1
i	0
mean	0
just	1
the	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
cost	0
of	0
living	1
and	1
loans	0
don't	0
pay	1
for	0
groceries	1
and	0
stuff	1

right	1
and	0
cars	1
and	0
all	0
their	0
books	1
and	0
the	0
books	0
are	0
outrageous	1
i	0
mean	1
absolutely	1
outrageous	1
and	1

oh	0
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0

and	1
they're	0
getting	0
worse	1
uh	0
my	0
daughter	0
brought	0
home	1
a	0
book	1
the	1
other	0
day	0
that	0
she	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
have	1
to	0
have	0
for	0
her	0
one	0
of	0
her	0
next	0
classes	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
like	1
ninety	0
six	0
dollars	1
and	0

jeez	0

and	0
this	0
book	1
is	0
a	0
little	1
bitty	0
skinny	0
book	1

yeah	0

i	1
said	0
my	0
goodness	1
what	0
is	1
it	0
lined	0
in	0
gold	1
you	0
know	0
uh	0

yeah	1

but	1
it	0
is	1
it's	0
getting	0
worse	1
and	0
if	0
i'd	0
of	0
probably	0
had	1
three	0
or	0
four	0
children	1
i	0
don't	0
see	1
how	0
we	0
could	0
have	0
made	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
without	1
me	0
working	0

but	0
that's	1
that's	0
probably	1
because	0
you	1
know	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
three	1
you	0
you	0
know	0
would	0
say	0
if	0
i'd	0
of	0
had	0
four	1
i	0
guess	0
it's	0
always	1
not	1
not	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
picture	1
one	0
more	1
but	0
in	0
essence	1
you	0
probably	0
would	0
have	0
worked	0
out	0
fine	1

right	1
but	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	0
to	0
work	1

yeah	1

if	0
i'd	0
of	0
had	0
that	1
many	0
i'd	0
of	0
had	0
to	0
work	1
in	0
order	0
for	0
my	0
kids	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
even	0
though	0
he	0
brings	0
in	0
a	0
real	0
good	0
living	1
and	0
everything	0
in	0
order	0
for	0
me	0
to	0
keep	0
up	1
i	0
would	0
have	0
had	1
to	0
work	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	1
think	0
it's	0
getting	0
more	0
and	0
more	1
like	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
one	0
child	1
now	0
that's	0
it	1
you	0
know	0
then	0

then	0
you	0
go	0
to	1
work	1
and	0
you	1
work	1

yeah	1

because	1
if	0
you	1
have	0
two	0
or	0
three	0
kids	1
by	0
the	0
way	0
the	0
inflation's	1
going	0
i	0
think	0
a	0
woman's	1
always	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
to	0
work	1
and	0
it's	0
just	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
an	0
accepted	0
thing	1
there	0
isn't	0
going	0
to	0
be	1
any	0
of	0
this	0
you	0
know	0
very	0
few	0
people	0
will	0
ever	0
stay	0
home	1

yeah	1
and	1
and	0
that's	0
all	1
right	1
with	0
me	0
because	0
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	0
stay	0
home	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
i	0
think	0
i'm	0
just	0
part	1
of	0
tha[t]	0
the	0
new	0
stuff	1
that	0
is	0
just	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	1
think	1
i	0
would	0
just	0
go	1
nuts	1
sitting	1
at	0
home	1
all	0
day	0
long	1

well	0
you	1
know	0
i	0
can't	0
imagine	1
how	0
i	0
did	0
because	1
now	1
i	0
work	0
all	0
the	0
time	1

yeah	1

and	1
um	0
well	0
i	0
work	0
all	0
week	1
and	1
um	0
i	0
can't	0
imagine	1
how	0
i	0
stayed	0
home	1

yeah	0

you	1
know	0
i	0
think	0
to	0
myself	1
what	0
did	0
i	0
do	1
and	0
i	0
think	1
it	0
just	1
it	0
revolutionized	1
an	0
where	0
a	0
woman	1
thinks	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
you	0
know	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
my	0
daughter	1
there's	0
no	0
way	1
that	0
she	0
can	0
imagine	0
herself	0
married	1
at	0
the	0
age	0
that	0
she's	0
at	0
now	1
to	0
her	1
everything	1
is	0
you've	0
got	0
to	0
go	0
through	0
college	1
you've	0
got	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
job	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
then	0
when	0
everything's	1
set	0
up	0
then	1
you	0
look	0
for	0
somebody	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
spend	0
the	0
rest	0
of	0
your	0
life	1
with	0
but	0
i	1
mean	0
it	0
is	0
so	0
far	0
down	0
the	0
road	1
where	0

right	1

where	0
now	1
when	0
i	0
graduated	0
high	1
school	0
the	0
thing	1

that's	1
you	0
did	1
that's	0
what	0
you	0
did	1
uh	1

uh-huh	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
got	0
married	1
and	0
then	0
you	0
had	0
a	0
family	1

i	1
mean	0
that's	0
just	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
was	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
that's	1
like	0
when	0
my	0
mo[m]	0
i	0
know	0
when	0
my	0
mother's	1
age	0
it	1
was	0
always	1
the	1
kids	1
and	0
the	0
family	1
and	1
everything	0
had	0
to	1
come	0
first	1
and	0
the	0
woman	0
stayed	1
home	0
and	0
took	1
care	1
of	0
them	0
an	0

i	1
uh	0
i	1
i	0
like	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
is	1

yeah	0

it's	0
uh	0
being	1
see	0
we're	0
from	0
Houston	1
and	0
so	0
it's	0
not	0
so	0
hard	1
for	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
you've	0
been	0
married	1
three	0
or	0
so	0
years	1
and	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
kids	1
well	0
it's	0
okay	1
no[t]	0
nobody	0
does	1
but	0
you	0
come	0
to	0
a	0
place	0
like	0
Belton	1
and	1
th[ere]	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	0
kids	0
here	1
get	1
married	0
out	0
of	0
high	0
school	0

uh-huh	1

it's	0
real	1
small	0
town	0
and	1
it's	0
and	0
a	1
lot	1
of	0
people	0
in	0
our	0
Su[nday]	1
we're	0
the	0
only	0
couple	1
in	0
our	0
Sunday	0
School	0

except	0
for	0
one	1
other	0
couple	0
who	0
are	0
in	0
their	0
forties	1
and	0
they	0
can't	1
have	0
children	0
who	0
don't	0
have	0
children	1
and	0
they	0
can't	0
imagine	1
why	0
we	0
would	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
children	1
and	0
i'm	0
going	1
well	1
you	0
know	1
there's	0
more	0
to	0
life	1
you	0
know	0
there's	1
life	0
in	0
there	1
that's	0

you	0
know	0
not	0
everybody	1
has	0
to	0
have	0
kids	1
and	0
i'd	0
rather	0
spend	0
the	0
time	0
with	0
my	0
husband	1
than	0
you	0
know	1
spending	0
time	1
here	0
it's	0
your	0
turn	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
that	1
now	1
even	1
whenever	0
i	1
was	0
coming	0
up	1
and	0
everything	0
and	0
we	1
got	0
married	0
right	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
school	0
well	0
a	0
year	1
after	0
i	0
got	0
out	0
of	1
high	0
school	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
i	0
didn't	0
have	0
kids	1
for	0
four	0
and	0
a	0
half	0
years	1
but	0
that	0
was	0
because	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
work	1
and	1
i	0
wasn't	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
that's	1
what	0
it	0
is	0
i'm	0
not	0
either	1

and	0
everybody	0
thought	1
oh	0
my	0
gosh	1
what	0
is	0
the	0
matter	1
with	0
her	0
[laughter-you]	0
[laughter-know]	0

they're	0
probably	1
going	0
oh	1
i	0
bet	0
she	0
can't	0
get	0
pregnant	1

right	1
i	1
mean	0
they	1
thought	0
that	0
it	0
was	0
terrible	1
you	0
know	0
and	0
then	0
when	0
i'd	0
tell	1
them	0
you	0
know	0
well	0
i'm	0
just	0
not	0
ready	1
for	0
children	0
yet	0
oh	1
but	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
better	1
you	0
better	0
just	0
get	0
ready	1
now	1

yeah	0

well	0
you	0
don't	0
just	1
get	0
ready	1
but	0
i	1
was	0
kind	0
of	0
odd	1
because	0
as	0
a	0
general	0
rule	1
the	0
people	0
that	0
married	1
during	0
my	0
time	1
they	0
had	0
kids	0
within	0
a	0
year	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
just	0
was	0
not	0
ready	1
for	0
kids	1
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
get	1
out	0
and	0
work	1
a	0
little	0
bit	0
and	0
i	0
wanted	0
to	0
travel	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
which	0
we	0
did	1
and	1
uh	0
kids	0
didn't	0
fit	0
in	1
right	0
then	0
but	0
it's	0
getting	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
like	0
that	1
where	0
there's	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
couples	1
and	1
really	1
if	0
you	1
don't	1
want	1
the	0
kids	0
then	1
it's	0
not	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
have	1
it	0
i	0
don't	0
care	0
what	0
anybody	1
tells	0
you	0

right	1

and	0
i	0
think	1
that	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
the	0
attitude's	1
getting	1
that	0
a	0
way	0
because	1
that's	0
like	0
my	0
daughter	1
now	0
she	1
says	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
maybe	0
when	0
she's	0
thirty	1
she	0
might	1
want	0
a	0
child	0
then	0

yeah	0

and	1
uh	0
even	0
though	0
i'd	0
like	0
to	0
have	0
grandchildren	1
i	0
can	0
see	0
her	0
point	1

yeah	1
Steve's	0
mom	1
finally	0
uh	0
finally	1
s[aid]	0
you	0
know	1
said	1
that	0
that	0
God	0
will	0
take	0
care	1
of	0
us	0
when	0
it's	0
our	0
time	1

right	1

she	0
finally	1
admitted	1
you	0
know	0
she	0
finally	1
told	0
me	0
it's	0
okay	0
if	0
you	0
don't	1
but	0
it	0
took	0
every	0
nerve	0
in	0
her	0
body	1
to	0
say	1
that	0
because	0
she's	1
from	0
a	0
very	0
very	0
old	0
fashioned	1
family	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
she	1
stayed	0
home	0
and	0
raised	1
her	0
kids	0
and	0
and	1
she	0
expected	1
all	0
of	0
her	0
kids	1
to	1
do	1
that	0
too	1
and	0
their	0
wives	1
and	0
to	0
be	1
the	0
the	0
housewife	1
and	0
have	0
dinner	0
ready	0
by	0
five	1
and	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
be	0
there	0
at	0
every	0
beck	0
and	0
call	1
and	0
i	0
was	0
raised	0
totally	0
opposite	1
[laughter-how]	0
we	0
got	0
together	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
but	0
because	0
my	0
mother	0
had	0
six	0
girls	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
she	1
worked	0
too	1

yeah	1

and	0
i	0
guess	1
i	1
just	0
and	0
i	0
saw	1
how	0
life	1
was	0
when	0
she	0
stayed	0
home	1
and	0
it	0
was	0
rough	1
it	0
was	0
hard	1
you	0
know	0

yeah	1
and	0
it	0
really	0
is	1
i	0
know	1
it	0
just	1
like	0
now	0
you	0
know	0
there's	1
there's	0
so	0
much	0
more	1
now	0
all	0
my	0
income	1
goes	1
for	0
things	0
like	0
luxuries	1
i	0
mean	0
it	0
really	0
does	1
except	0
for	0
what	0
we	1
give	0
to	0
my	0
daughter	1
to	0
you	1
know	0
put	0
her	0
through	0
college	1
and	0
stuff	0

uh-huh	0

but	0
the	0
rest	1
of	0
it	0
we	0
just	0
buy	0
things	1
like	0
boats	1
or	1
we	0
go	0
on	0
trips	1
or	0
you	0
know	1
just	1
the	0
more	1
or	0
less	0
like	0
entertainment	1
stuff	0

right	1

but	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	1
you've	0
you've	0
earned	1
that	0
though	0

yeah	1
i	0
feel	0
like	0
i	0
have	1
you	0
know	0
because	1
well	1
we're	0
to	0
the	0
age	1
now	1
i'm	0
not	0
old	1
but	0
i'm	0
older	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
uh	0
i	0
got	0
to	0
stay	0
home	0
with	0
my	0
kids	1
which	0
i	0
really	0
wanted	1
to	0
do	0
but	0
now	1
i	0
could	0
not	0
go	0
back	1
and	0
do	0
it	0

yeah	0

i	0
really	0
couldn't	1
i	0
don't	0
think	0
i	0
could	0
stay	0
home	1
all	1
the	0
time	0
and	0
do	0
nothing	1
and	0
i	0
mean	0
i	0
did	1
stuff	0
but	0
to	0
me	1
it	0
[laughter-feels]	0
[laughter-like]	0
[laughter-i]	0
[laughter-must]	0
have	0
done	1
nothing	0

right	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
it's	0
just	0
the	0
new	0
way	0
that	0
people	0
are	0
thinking	1

yeah	0
i	0
think	0
so	1

but	1
uh	0

i	0
think	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
neat	1
if	0
if	0
they	0
could	0
incorporate	1
into	0
small	1
and	0
large	1
businesses	0
both	1
a	0
built	1
in	0
day	0
cares	1
where	0
the	0
children	0
were	0
there	1
in	0
the	0
facility	1
but	0
not	1
necessarily	0
right	0
there	0
with	1
you	0

well	0
you	1
know	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
of	0
them	0
are	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
it	0
is	1
up	0
there	0
where	0
you	1
are	0
but	0
where	0
i	1
am	0
the	0
just	0
like	0
all	0
the	0
hospitals	1
they're	0
getting	0
day	1
care	0

uh-huh	1

are	1
they	0

but	1
the	0
reason	0
they	0
had	0
to	0
do	1
this	0
was	0
because	0
so	0
many	0
people	1
you	0
know	0
so	0
many	0
women	1
could	0
not	0
afford	1
like	0
you	1
said	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
four	0
kids	1
or	0
even	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
two	1
kids	0
you	0
would	0
be	0
paying	1
all	0
your	0
salary	1
to	0
pay	0
for	0
those	0
two	0
kids	1
to	0
go	1

right	1

so	1
uh	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
of	0
our	0
hospitals	1
especially	0
over	0
here	1
are	0
getting	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
bigger	0
companies	1
but	0
it's	0
mainly	0
the	0
hospitals	1

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
the	0
TI	0
in	0
Dallas	1
does	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
know	1
i	0
know	0
nobody	0
around	0
here	1
does	0
it	0
we're	1
it's	0
too	0
small	1
around	0
here	0

oh	0
really	1

yeah	1

it's	1
it's	1
hard	1
to[pic]	0
topic	0
because	1
is	1
it	0
is	1
it	1
is	0
it	0
doing	0
a	0
good	1
job	1
or	0
a	1
bad	1
job	0
and	1
you	1
got	1
to	0
divide	1
it	1
two	1
different	0
categories	1
whether	1
you	1
live	0
in	1
the	1
city	1
or	1
whether	1
you	0
live	1
in	1
a	0
more	0
rural	1
place	0
like	0
i	1
do	0

yeah	1
and	1
are	1
you	0
talking	0
about	1
public	0
schools	0
being	1
lower	0
level	1
high	0
school	0
level	1
or	0
state	1
school	0

well	0
public	0
school	0
all	0
the	1
way	0
up	0
kindergarten	0
all	1
the	0
way	0
up	1
to	1
uh	0
uh	1
high	0
school	1

okay	0
but	1
you're	1
excluding	1
high-level	0
education	1

yes	0
well	1
yeah	1
i	1
am	0
um	1

okay	0

act[ually]	0
actually	0
i	0
think	1
that	1
i	0
at	1
the	1
higher	0
level	1
education	1
i	1
don't	0
think	1
there's	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
a	0
problem	1
there	0
it's	0
pretty	0
much	1
funded	1
well	0
there	0
are	1
small	0
colleges	0
that	0
i'm	0
sure	0
are	0
struggling	1
but	1
uh	0
it's	0
the	0
job	1
that	0
the	0
the	0
high	1
school	0
and	0
the	0
grade	1
schools	0
are	1
doing	0
that	0
i	0
see	1
in	0
a	0
area	1
like	1
ours	0
our	0
school	0
even	0
a	0
bad	1
school	0
is	0
a	0
good	1
school	1
up	0
here	0
where	1
if	1
i	0
lived	1
in	0
New	0
York	0
City	1
or	1
Washington	0
DC	1
uh	0
i	0
would	0
seriously	0
consider	0
moving	1
if	0
i	0
had	0
a	0
child	1
i	0
wouldn't	0
let	0
them	0
go	1
to	0
a	0
public	1
school	0
system	0
there	0
but	0
of	0
course	0
people	0
are	0
trapped	1
economically	1
and	0
they	0
can't	0
do	1
that	0

yeah	0
i	0
know	0
down	1
here	0
the	0
school's	1
are	0
you	1
know	0
i	1
don't	0
know	1
they	1
rate	0
i	1
moved	0
to	0
Arkansas	0
and	1
Texas	1
after	0
living	0
in	0
Ohio	1
and	1
the	0
schools	0
down	0
here	0
rate	0
you	0
know	0
bottom	0
ten	1
percent	1
across	0
the	0
country	0
and	0
having	0
been	1
through	1
grade	0
school	1
up	0
there	1
and	0
coming	0
down	0
here	0
to	0
high	1
school	0
i	0
can	0
understand	0
why	1
because	0
they're	0
so	0
far	0
behind	1
and	0
so	0
poorly	0
staffed	1
half	0
the	0
time	1
the	0
teachers	1
don't	1
know	0
what's	0
going	0
on	1

well	0
that's	0
really	0
too	0
bad	1
because	1
i[t]	0
it	0
it's	0
giving	0
some	0
people	1
unfair	0
advantage	1
i	0
mean	0
we	1
our	0
high	1
school	0
up	0
here	1
is	0
like	0
a	0
junior	0
college	1
in	0
Florida	1

right	0

what	0
we	0
learned	0

well	0
that	0
was	0
my	0
experience	1
going	0
through	0
junior	0
high	0
up	0
there	1
when	0
i	0
came	0
down	1
south	0
for	1
high	1
school	0
i	0
was	1
just	0
repeating	1
what	1
i'd	0
already	0
done	1
because	0
we	0
were	0
so	0
far	0
advanced	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
i'd	0
been	0
in	0
a	0
parochial	1
school	0
before	0
junior	1
high	0
and	1
you	1
know	0
even	0
the	0
public	1
schools	0
are	1
behind	0
the	0
parochial	1
schools	0

yeah	0

so	1
you	0
know	1
i	1
i	0
like	0
the	0
concept	1
they've	0
got	0
now	1
where	0
they	0
have	0
more	0
directed	0
education	1
you	0
know	0
you	0
you	0
pick	0
a	0
career	0
path	1
or	0
you	1
get	0
counseling	0
earlier	1
and	0
then	1
you	0
you	0
learn	0
the	0
things	0
that	0
help	1
you	0
rather	0
than	0
spending	1
four	0
years	0
learning	0
the	0
same	0
things	0
over	0
and	0
over	1

oh	0
they	1
they	0
have	0
that	0
down	0
there	1
that	1

well	1
they	0
talk	1
about	0
it	0
and	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
few	1
in	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
more	1
like	0
in	0
i	0
live	1
in	0
a	0
big	0
metroplex	1
and	0
some	1
of	0
the	0
the	0
better	1
parts	0
of	0
the	0
metroplex	0
the	0
the	0
suburbs	0
that	0
are	0
richer	1
have	0
those	0
kind	0
of	0
target	1
schools	0
but	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0

yeah	0
it's	0
like	1
if	1
if	0
your	0
father	0
owns	0
a	0
grocery	1
store	1
and	1
you're	0
really	1
interested	0
in	1
that	1
there's	0
no	0
reason	0
that	1
you	0
should	1
take	1
college	1
prep	0
courses	0
when	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
some	0
general	0
business	1
courses	0
in	1
high	1
school	0

right	0

or	0
if	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
the	0
science	1
route	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
target	0
school	0
that	0
specializes	0
in	0
science	1
or	0
art	1
you	0
know	0
there's	0
no	0
point	1
in	0
you	0
know	1
i'm	0
an	0
engineering	1
student	0
and	0
if	0
i	0
have	0
to	0
go	0
take	0
art	1
classes	0
you	0
know	0
i'm	0
not	1
going	0
to	0
use	1
them_1	0
and	0
through	0
high	1
school	0
i	0
could	0
have	0
gone	0
so	0
much	0
further	1
if	0
i'd	0
gone	0
to	0
a	0
school	1
that	0
was	0
directed	1

yeah	0
that's	0
where	0
i	0
was	0
fortunate	0
i'm	1
a	0
i'm	0
a	0
technician	1
and	0
we	0
had	0
a	0
vocational	1
um	1
electronics	1
in	1
our	1
high	0
school	0

right	0
in	0
high	0
school	0

so	0
when	0
i	0
went	1
to	1
my	1
first	0
year	0
of	0
tech	0
school	1
uh	0
i	1
had	1
a	0
very	0
easy	0
time	1
because	0
our	0
high	1
school	1
had	1
a	0
a	0
good	1
program	1

right	0

i	0
think	0
the	0
schools	0
today	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
public	1
schools	0
are	0
just	0
they're	0
just	0
overrun	1
you	0
know	0
they	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
to	0
do	1
there's	0
too	0
many	0
kids	1
and	0
not	0
enough	0
teachers	1
and	0
too	0
many	0
kids	0
don't	0
care	0

yeah	0
i	0
find	1
that	0
that	1
the	0
that	1
in	0
the	0
in	0
the	0
cities	1
it's	0
more	0
less	0
the	0
kids	0
go	0
there	1
to	0
socialize	1
not	0
really	0
to	0
learn	1
and	0

and	0

right	0

and	0
the	0
parents	1
send	0
them_1	0
there	0
because	0
they're	0
supposed	1
to	0
and	0
plus	0
it	0
gets	0
them	0
out	0
of	0
their	0
hair	1
and	0
i	0
also	1
find	0
that	1
that	0
you	0
can	0
send	1
a	0
kid	0
to	0
school	1
but	0
if	1
don't	0
work	0
with	0
them	0
as	0
a	0
parent	1
i	1
think	1
you're	0
putting	1
your	1
child	0
at	0
a	1
big	0
disadvantage	1

yeah	0
and	1
you	0
know	0
there's	0
some	1
kids	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
learn	1
but	0
most	0
of	0
them_1	0
just	0
want	0
to	1
go	0
play	0

yeah	0
well	0
i	0
could	1
i	0
could	0
see	1
if	0
a	0
kid	0
doesn't	0
have	0
any	0
encouragement	1
if	1
they're	1
you	1
know	0
come	0
from	0
a	1
broken	0
home	1
and	1
their	0
parents	1
are	0
more	0
concerned	0
about	1
trying	0
to	1
work	1
and	1
or	1
maybe	1
they're	0
unemployed	0
and	0
they're	0
mad	1
at	0
the	1
world	1
i	0
can	0
see	0
where	1
that	0
wouldn't	0
be	1
very	1
good	0
for	0
a	1
a	0
kid	1
you	0
know	1
he's	0
coming	0
up	1
will	0
you	0
help	0
me	0
with	0
my	0
homework	1
and	0
they're	1
no	1
get	0
away	1
from	0
me	0
i've	1
had	0
a	0
terrible	1
day	1
so	1
it's	0
got	1
a	0
lot	0
to	0
do	0
with	1
economics	1
in	1
the	1
area	1
that	0
you	1
come	1
from	0

yeah	0
that's	0
true	0
i'm	0
wondering	0
with	0
the	0
boom	0
down	0
here	0
it's	1
well	0
not	0
at	0
the	1
moment	0
but	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	0
industry's	0
moving	1
southward	1

yes	0
are	0
they	0
going	0
to	0
move	0
to	0
uh	0
Mexico	1

so	0

oh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
about	0
that	1
but	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
the	0
industry	1
up	1
in	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
the	0
northern	1
states	0
is	0
moving	0
south	1

and	0
i'm	0
wondering	1
if	0
that's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
any	0
effect	1
you	0
know	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
see	0
now	1
we're	0
we're	0
we're	0
behind	0
down	0
here	1

yeah	0

i	0
say	0
we	0
because_1	0
i	0
live	1
here	0
if	0
that	0
might	0
not	0
turn	0
around	1
in	0
the	0
next	1
you	0
know	0
fifteen	0
twenty	0
years	1

yeah	0
maybe	1
the	0
maybe	0
they'll	1
bring	1
their	0
good	0
schools	1
with	0
them	0
you	0
know	0
if	0
the	1
industry	0
comes	1
hopefully	0
they'll	0
promote	0
good	0
schools	1

yeah	0

because	0
i	0
know	0
the	0
town	1
that	0
i	0
come	0
from	0
the	0
the	1
uh	1
the	0
large	1
IBM	0
plant	0
has	0
something	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
the	0
top	1
rated	0
high	0
school	0
because	0
of	0
their	0
tax	1
base	0
for	0
one	0
and	0
plus	1
for	0
for	1
the	0
type	0
of	0
student	1
that's	0
going	1
to	0
that	0
school	0
it's	0
going	1
to	0
raise	1
the	0
level	1
of	0
the	0
school	0
because	0
your	0
parents	1
are	1
engineers	1
or	0
chemists	1

right	0

they're	0
they're	0
you're	0
most	0
likely	0
to	0
do	1
better	0
in	1
school	1
they're	0
going	0
to	0
help	1
you	0

you	0
hope	0

yeah	0
you	0
hope	1
well	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
i	1
don't	0
know	0
i	0
just	0
think	1
it	1
it's	0
it's	0
a	0
duty	0
of	0
the	0
parent	1
to	0
do	1
that	0
i	0
mean	1
jeez	1
my	0
parents	0
always	0
helped	0
me	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
like	0
you	0
say	0
it's	0
the	0
way	0
you're	0
raised	1
and	0
the	1
economic	1
situation	1
you're	0
in	0
i	0
can	0
see	0
some	0
lady	1
she's	0
twenty	0
one	0
years	0
old	0
and	0
she's	0
got	0
four	0
kids	1
a	0
kid	0
in	0
her	0
first	0
grader	0
i	0
don't	1
see	0
where	0
she's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
much	0
time	1
for	0
him	0
so	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
it's	0
just	0
like	0

i	0
guess	0
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
wonder	0
is	0
it	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
is	0
it	0
you	0
know	0
who	1
whose	0
supposed	0
to	1
make	0
the	0
change	1
the	0
the	0
state	0
the	0
govern[ment]	0
the	0
federal	1
government	0
you	0
know	1
where's	0
the	0
money	0
supposed	1
to	0
come	1
from	0
is	0
it	1
you	0
know	0
what	0

i	0
don't	0
know	0
actually	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
should	0
be	1
a	0
civic	1
level	0
the	0
city	1
level	0
and	0
a	0
a	0
system	1
level	0
really	1
to	0
find	1
out	0
and	0
t[o]	0
to	0
see	0
what	0
they	0
need	0
and	0
not	0
overinflate	1
it	0

what	0
what	0
do	0
you	0
advocate	1
more	0
taxes	0
or	0
better	0
management	0
of	0
what	1
they	0
got	0

like	1
if	0
the	0
teachers	0
are	0
getting	0
six	0
percent	0
raises	1
every	0
year	1
when	0
people	0
in	0
industry	0
have	0
been	0
getting	0
cut	0
back	1
and	0
you're	0
getting	0
raises	0
every	0
eighteen	0
months	1
you	0
got	0
to	0
go	1
hey	0
now	0
wait	1
a	0
minute	0
we're	0

yeah	0

we're	0
in	0
a	0
recession	1
here	0
we	1
uh	0
our	0
town	1
didn't	0
pass	0
the	0
school	1
budget	0
this	0
year	1
and	0
for	0
the	0
first	0
time	1
in	0
many	0
many	0
years	1
just	0
because	0
people	1
are	0
are	0
in	0
the	0
recession	1
and	0
they're	0
even	0
though	1
we've	1
uh	0
enjoyed	0
very	0
good	1
employment	1
here	0
for	0
the	0
past	0
ten	1
years	0
now	0
we	0
got	0
eight	1
percent	0
uh	0
unemployment	1
when	1
it	0
used	0
to	0
be	1
four	0
or	0
five	1
people	0
are	0
going	0
whoa	0

yeah	0

so	0

starts	0
hitting	0
closer	0
to	0
home	1

yeah	0
but	0
i	1
always	1
see	1
it's	0
all	0
it's	0
all	0
money	1
this	1
like	0
a	0
couple	0
other	0
topics	1
we	0
had	0
talked	0
about	0
was	0
crime	1
It	0
it's	0
it's	0
all	0
money	1
based	0
and	1
what	0
you	0
can	0
do	1
unless	0
you	1
just	0
get	0
down	0
to	0
the	0
parent	1
level	0
and	0
and	1
then	0
if	0
you're	0
in	1
a	0
bad	1
situation	0
where	0
you	0
have	0
to	1
send	1
your	0
child	0
to	0
a	0
bad	0
school	1
who	0
knows	0
bu[t]	0
maybe	1
we	0
do	1
we	0
need	1
some	0
more	0
Catholic	0
schools	1
support	0
the	0
church	0
instead	1
they	0
seem	0
to	0
have	0
done	1
a	0
the	1
good	0
job	0
in	1
the	0
past	1
in	1
uh	0
some	1
places	1
uh	0
you	0
couldn't	0
go	0
to	1
a	0
public	0
school	1
it	0
was	0
miles	0
down	1
the	0
road	1
and	0
the	0
only	0
school	0
you	0
could	1
go	1
to	0
was	0
the	0
Baptist	1
school	0
or	0
the	0
Catholic	1
school	0
so	0

yeah	0
they're	0
a	0
lot	1
more	0
strict	0

yeah	0
the	1
i	0
don't	0

you	0
uh	0
have	0
to	0
learn	0
you	0
aren't	0
given	1
the	0
chance	0
to	0
you	0
know	0
screw	1
off	0
all	0
the	0
time	0

yeah	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
i	0
would	0
do	1
that	0
to	0
my	0
[laughter-child]	1
[laughter-though]	1
but	0
so	0
hum	0
pretty	0
much	0
though	0
see	0
i	1
don't	0
have	0
any	0
good	0
ideas	1
or	0
or	0
anything	0
that	0
would	0
contribute	1
see	0
this	0
isn't	1
a	0
subject	1
that	0
i	0
think	0
a	1
lot	0
about	1
because	1
i'm	0
never	0
faced	1
with	0
it	0
because	0
our	0
school	1
system	0
in	0
Vermont	1
it	0
seems	0
to	0
do	0
a	0
really	0
good	0
job	1

well	1
i	0
know	1
i'm	1
in	0
the	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
only	0
reason	0
i	0
asked	0
about	0
secondary	1
schools	0
or	0
you	0
know	0
advanced	0
education	1
is	0
because	0
down	0
here	1
you	0
know	0
going	0
to	0
the	0
University	0
of	0
Texas	1
the	0
education	0
i'm	1
getting	0
i	0
think	1
is	0
kind	0
of	0
shoddy	1
for	1
a	0
public	0
school	1

is	0
it	0

i	1
i	0
don't	0
think	1
i'm	0
getting	0
what	0
i	0
should	1
but	1
you	0
know	0
in	0
Texas	1
it's	0
next	0
to	0
free	1
because	0
th[ey]	0
they	0
pay	0
so	0
much	1
of	0
it	0
it's	0
state	0
supported	0

well	0
that	0

but	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	1
it's	0
really	0
not	1
it's	0
not	0
like	0
going	0
to	0
MIT	1
my	1
engineering	1
degree	0
will	0
be	0
nothing	0
like	0
somebody	0
coming	1
out	0
of	1
MIT	1
and	0
that's	1
it's	1
really	0
too	0
bad	1

well	0

but	0
that's	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
just	0
builds	1
on	0
the	0
foundation	0
that	0
they've	0
already	0
built	1
you	1
get	0
people	0
out	0
of	0
high	1
schools	0
and	0
col[lege]	1
junior	1
colleges	0
that	0
don't	0
have	0
the	0
background	1
for	0
an	0
MIT	0
kind	0
of	0
curriculum	0
so	0

so	0
you	0
have	1
to	0
go	0
to	0
a	0
lesser	1
engineering	0
school	0
we	0
have	1
a	0
very	0
good	0
public	0
school	0
up	0
here	1
and	1
a	0
degree	1
out	0
there	0
means	0
a	0
lot	1
it's	0
a	0
very	1
good	0
school	1
it's	0
it's	0
University	0
of	0
Vermont	1
um	0
we	1
also	0
have	0
some	0
two	0
year	0
college	1
well	1
there's	0
a	0
four	1
year	0
colleges	0
they	0
all	1
have	0
a	0
pretty	0
good	0
reputation	1
but	0
like	0
you	0
say	0
you	0

okay	1

so	1
are	0

freshwater	1
or	1

mostly	0

Galveston	1
with	1
my	1
parents	1
and	1
i	0
never	0
really	0
got	0
into	0
that	1
too	1
much	1
because	0
you	1
have	0
to	0
get	0
in	1
the	0
boat	1
really	1
to	1
to	0
do	0
anything	1
and	1
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
anybody	0
who	1
had	0
a	0
boat	1
now	1
so	1
i	0
don't	0
fish	0
too	0
much	0
in	1
saltwater	1

um-hum	0
most	0
of	0
my	0
fishing	0
has	0
been	0
in	0
the	0
saltwater	1
huh	0
mostly	0
deep	0
sea	0
fishing	1
for	0
grouper	1
and	0
bottom	0
fish	1

oh	0
really	1

oh	1
neat	1

and	1
uh	0
huh	0
i	0
have	0
caught	1
one	0
or	0
two	1
small	1
sharks	1

oh	1
really	1

and	1
uh	0
yes	1

what'd	0
you	0
do	0
with	1
them	1

put	0
them	0
[laughter-back]	1

you	0
didn't	0
get	1
a	1
big	0
kick	1
out	1
of	1
killing	0
them	0
like	1
some	0
people	0
do	1

no	1
no	0
no	0
i	0
love	0
shark	0
steak	1
but	1
uh	0
the	0
ones	0
i	0
caught	1
were	0
never	1
large	0
enough	0
to	1
uh	0
really	0
do	0
anything	1
uh	0

do	0
they	0
have	0
a	0
limit	0
on	0
sharks	1
i	0
mean	0
is	0
that	0
like	0
a	0
a	1
sport	0
fish	1
can	0
you	1
actually	0
catch	1
those	1
and	1
there's	0
no	0
limit	1

is	0
there	0
a	0
limit	1
i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	1
i	0
know	1
i	1
my	0
home	1
is	0
in	0
uh	1
Pensacola	0
Florida	1
so	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
it's	0
they	0
do	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
shark	0
fishing	1
in	0
that	0
you	1
know	0
in	0
the	0
gulf	1

right	1

and	1
um	0
a	0

from	1
i	0
guess	0
from	0
Galveston	1
to	1
Mayport	1
they	0
have	1
uh	0
shark	0
tournaments	1
and	1
you	1
know	1

part	1
either	0

of	0
or	0
separate	0
from	1
the	1
uh	0
bill	0

long	0
time	1
last	0
time	0

out	0
as	0
much	0
as	0
i	1
uh	0
as	0
i	0

in	0
um	0

hour	0
away	0
from	0
the	0
eastern	0

here	0
in	0
Maryland	1

right	1

and	0
they	0
do	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
fishing	1
there	0
of	0
course	0
what	0
i	0
used	0
to	0
like	0
to	0
do	0
though	0

uh	0
go	0
snorkeling	1
for	0
scallops	1
in	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
bays	1
or	1
uh	0
or	0
oy[ster]	1
for	0
oysters	1

oh	1
yeah	1

that	0
would	0
be	0
fun	1

and	1
uh	0
that	1
i	0
was	0
able	0
to	0
do	1
uh	0
when	0
i	0
could	0
go	0
in	1
and	0
go	0
down	1
and	1
actually	1
pick	0
them	0
off	0
the	1
[laughter-bottom]	1

right	1

hand	0
picked	1

[laughter-that's]	1
[laughter-right]	1

the	0
weirdest	0
fishing	0
experience	1
i	0
ever	1
had	1
and	0
uh	0
people	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
are	0
still	0
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
if	0
i	0
really	0
caught	0
what	0
i	0
think	0
i	0
caught	1
we	0
were	0
in	1
uh	0
Rockport	1
which	0
is	0
close	0
to	0
Corpus	1

um-hum	0

and	0
we	0
had	0
been	0
fishing	0
in	0
a	0
canal	1
they	0
had	0
all	0
these	0
canals	1
up	0
through	0
this	1
one	0
little	0
retirement	1
area	0
and	1
uh	0
we'd	0
been	0
fishing	0
in	0
the	0
canals	1
and	0
all	0
we	0
were	0
catching	0
were	0
catfish	1
and	0
we	0
were	0
pretty	0
bored	0
with	0
that	1
so	0
we	0
thought	1
well	0
maybe	0
there	0
are	0
some	0
crab	0
in	0
here	1
we'll	0
try	0
to	0
catch	0
some	0
crab	1
so	0
i	0
got	0
my	0
chicken	0
neck	1
and	0
all	0
my	0
little	1
net	0
and	0
everything	1
and	0
something	1
i	0
had	0
a	1
rock	1
to	0
weight	0
it	0
down	1
something	0
grabs	1
and	0
just	0
runs	1
with	0
it	0
and	0
of	0
course	0
there's	0
no	0
hook	1
so	1
it	0
can't	0
be	0
a	0
fish	1

um-hum	0

i'm	1
i'm	0
sure	0
it's	0
not	0
a	0
fish	1
right	1
and	1
crab	1
they	0
don't	1
bite	0
like	0
that	1
they	0
don't	0
just	0
run	0
with	0
your	0
food	1
so	1
i	0
netted	1
it	0
and	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
ugliest	0
fish	0
i've	0
ever	0
seen	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
It	0
had	0
real	0
teeth	1
like	0
human	0
teeth	1
and	0
it	0
looked	1
archaic	1
i	1
i	0
had	0
no	1
idea	0
what	0
it	0
was	0
i	0
called	0
my	0
father	1
long	0
distance	1
just	0
to	0
describe	0
the	0
thing	1
and	0
it	0
had	0
the	0
rock	1
in	0
it's	1
mouth	1
it	1
not	0
the	0
chicken	1
but	0
the	0
rock	0
itself	1
is	0
what	0
it	0
had	0
grabbed	1

hm	0

they	0
say	0
it's	0
a	0
dogfish	1
from	0
everything	0
i've	0
described	1
it	0
was	0
brown	1
with	0
these	0
little	0
white	0
dots	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
it	0
made	0
a	0
loud	1
kind	0
of	0
almost	0
a	0
croaking	1
noise	0
like	0
a	0
croaker	0
does	1

uh-huh	0

it	1
it	0
was	0
the	0
strangest	0
thing	1
it	1
oh	1
i'll	0
never	0
get	0
over	0
that	1
to	0
this	0
day	1
i	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
in	0
the	0
water	1
anywhere	0
around	0
salt	1
water	0
because	0
i'm	0
sure	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
fish	1
are	0
there	0

well	1
we	0
used	0
to	1
i	0
guess	1
the	0
weirdest	0
thing	0
i've	0
ever	0
caught	1
is	1
uh	0
in	1
some	0
of	0
the	1
inlets	1
and	0
the	0
rivers	1
around	1
Rehoboth	0
Delaware	1

um-hum	1

they	0
have	0
a	0
fish	1
that's	0
called	1
an	0
oyster	0
cracker	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
you've	0
ever	0
heard	1
of	0
it	0

i've	0
never	0
heard	0
of	0
that	0
one	1

and	1
it	0
has	0
a	0
huge	1
strong	1
mouth	1
and	0
they	0
actually	1
uh	0
use	0
their	0
teeth	1
to	0
open	1
oysters	1

that's	0
where	0
it	0
gets	0
its	0
name	1
obviously	1
huh	1

um-hum	0
and	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
ugliest	1
fish	1
i	0
have	1
ever	1
seen	0
and	1

and	1
i	0
me[an]	0
and	0
they	0
come	0
in	0
all	0
si[ze]	1
you	1
know	0
i've	1
i've	0
caught	0
them	1
from	1
you	1
know	0
three	0
or	0
four	0
inches	1
long	1
up	1
to	0
uh	0

um-hum	0

i	0
guess	0
the	1
la[rgest]	0
largest	0
one	0
i	0
ever	0
caught	1
was	0
probably	0
eight	0
or	0
ten	1
inches	0
long	0
but	0
just	1
huge	1
ugly	0
things	1
just	0
terrible	1

huh	1

can	0
you	0
eat	1
them	0

no	1
no	1

ooh	1
i	1
i	0
don't	0
think	0
i'd	0
want	1
to	0
even	0
if	0
you	0
could	1
if	0
they're	0
that	0
ugly	1
but	1

they	1
just	0
they	0
just	1
look	0
as	0
though	0
you	0
do	0
not	0
want	0
to	0
do	0
anything	0
with	1
them	0

that's	0
like	0
this	0
dogfish	1
it	0
was	1
it	0
scared	0
me	0
to	1
death	1

um-hum	0

it	0
was	0
u[gly]	1
it	0
really	1
it	0
didn't	0
look	0
like	1
it	0
looked	0
like	0
it	0
was	0
something	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
dark	1
ages	0
that	0
just	0
never	0
died	1

well	0
the	0
first	0
time	0
i	0
went	1
uh	0
surf	1
fishing	0
was	0
in	0
and	0
i	0
threw	0
my	0
line	0
out	1
and	1
the	0
first	0
thing	0
i	0
caught	1
was	0
a	0
sand	1
shark	0
which	0
was	0
probably	1
a	0
foot	0
and	0
a	0
half	1
or	1
uh	0
two	0
feet	0
long	1

and	0
scared	0
me	0
to	0
death	1

oh	0

i	0
i	0
had	0
never	1
seen	1
anything	0
and	0
then	1
i	1
was	0
fi[shed]	1
fished	0
for	0
another	0
half	0
hour	0
or	0
forty	0
five	0
minutes	0
caught	1
a	0
few	0
white	0
fish	1
and	0
so	1
forth	0
and	0
then	0
i	1
felt	0
something	1
relatively	0
heavy	1
and	0
i	1
thought	0
oh	1
really	1
here	1
i'm	0
really	1
going	0
to	0
get	1
one	0

and	1
i	0
pulled	1

okay	1
this	1
topic	0
is	1
is	0
Russia	0
a	1
threat	1
to	1
our	0
security	1
i	0
think	0
they're	0
more	0
of	1
a	0
threat	1
to	1
their	0
own	1
people	1
at	1
this	0
day	0
and	0
time	1
how	0
do	0
you	0
feel	1
about	1
it	1

well	1
they	1
do	0
have	1
uh	0
a	1
major	1
internal	1
problem	1
everybody	0
wants	0
to	0
defect	1
and	1
i	0
can	0
understand	0
why	1
um	0
i	0
think	1
their	0
biggest	0
problem	0
is	0
just	1
you	1
know	1
obtaining	1
food	0
to	0
live	1
so	1
when	0
you	1
have	0
the	1
basic	0
needs	1
uh	0
being	1
unmet	1
i	1
don't	1
think	0
you	0
think	1
globally	1
as	1
far	1
as	0
you	0
know	1
being	0
a	1
threat	0
to	0
other	0
people	0
in	1
the	1
world	1

so	0
as	0
soon	0
as	0
they	1
get	1
their	1
their	0
own	1
home	1
country	0
taken	1
care	1
of	1
then	0
they'll	1
consider	1
what	0
they	0
can	0
do	0
with	0
the	0
rest	0
of	1
the	0
world	1

i	0
believe	1
Communism	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
waning	1
it's	1
uh	1
pretty	0
much	1
on	0
the	0
way	0
out	1
of	0
the	1
door	1
in	1
so	1
far	0
as	1
the	0
strong	0
hold	1
that	0
they	1
used	0
to	0
have	1
and	1
the	0
Russian	0
people	1
are	1
all	0
realizing	1
that	0
the	0
Communist	0
system	0
does	1
not	1
work	1
to	1
their	1
satisfaction	1
or	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
surviving	0
in	0
this	0
world	1
and	1
their	1
rebellions	1
right	0
now	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
that	0
i[f]	0
if	1
they	0
can	0
get	0
the	1
army	1
or	1
the	0
military	1
to	0
sway	0
to	0
their	0
side	1
i	1
think	1
that	0
uh	0
it	1
will	0
be	1
on	0
the	0
way	0
out	1
eventually	1

it's	0
just	0
a	0
matter	0
of	0
time	1
because	1
in	0
the	0
Baltic	0
States	1
they've	0
already	1
massacred	1
so	0
many	0
people	1
who	0
protested	1
and	1

and	1
that	0
hasn't	0
set	0
too	0
well	0
with	1
their	1
diplomacy	1
for	0
the	1
regarding	1
the	0
uh	0
outcome	0
of	0
their	1
affairs	1
what's	0
your	0
synopsis	1

well	1
i	1
do	1
i	0
do	0
realize	0
that	1
um	0
uh	1
the	0
Bush	0
Administration	0
isn't	1
too	0
happy	1
with	1
with	0
how	0
they're	0
handling	0
their	0
internal	1
um	0
strife	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
diplomacy	0
is	0
concerned	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
been	0
a	0
good	1
a	0
good	1
uh	0
positive	0
direction	0
for	1
um	0
the	0
Soviets	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
Yeltsin	0
is	0
concerned	1
you	0
know	1
he	1
was	0
um	0
allowed	0
to	1
what	0
wh[at]	0
in	0
his	1
in	0
the	1
in	0
the	0
Congress	1
they	0
they	0
gave	0
him	0
more	0
power	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
his	0
republic	0
in	0
Russia	0
is	0
concerned	1
which	0
is	1
gives	0
him	0
more	0
power	1
overall	1
which	0
i	0
think	0
is	1
a	0
good	0
sign	1
that	0
there'll	0
be	0
some	1
you	0
know	1
politically	0
speaking	1
you	1
know	0
he's	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
more	0
power	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
a	0
step	0
in	0
the	0
right	0
direction	1
i	0
think	0
Gorbachev	1
realizes	0
that	0
he's	0
got	1
a	1
a	0
major	1
uh	0
uh	0
power	0
figure	1
you	0
know	1
competing	0
against	0
him	1
and	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
gonna	0
be	1
pretty	0
close	0
to	0
his	0
demise	1
if	0
he	0
doesn't	1
follow	0
suit	0
with	0
Yeltsin	1
as	0
far	1
as	0
uh	0
realizing	1
well	1
he	0
does	0
realize	1
it	0
you	0
know	0
with	0
the	0
fact	1
that	0
they	0
reduced	1
the	0
uh	0
or	0
they	0
increased	0
the	0
prices	1
on	0
their	0
food	1
food	1
and	0
goods	1

uh-huh	1
i	1

uh	0
it	1
yeah	1

i	1
think	1
that	0
it	1
went	0
up	0
a	0
thousand	1
percent	0
on	0
most	1

yeah	1
tha[t's]	1
that's	0
incredible	1
but	0
they	0
had	1
to	0
um	0
go	0
in	0
the	0
direction	1
of	0
a	0
market	0
driven	0
economy	1
and	1
and	0
they	0
had	0
to	0
bite	0
the	0
bullet	1
for	0
that	0
so	0
that's	0
a	0
good	0
move	1
on	1
on	0
Gorbachev's	0
part	1
in	0
doing	0
that	1

um-hum	1

so	1

but	0
Gorbachev	0
has	0
still	0
not	0
fully	1
convinced	0
everyone	1
that	0
he's	1
moving	1
towards	0
a	0
two	1
to	1
three	0
party	0
system	1
of	0
government	1
that	0
nor	1
eliminating	1
or	1
diminishing	0
the	0
Communist	0
power	1

and	0
i	0
guess	0
that's	0
where	0
Yeltsin	0
steps	0
in	1
so	0
far	1
as	0
his	0
politics	1
of	1
government	0
goes	1
uh	0
but	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
how	0
convinced	1
the	0
people	0
are	0
of	1
him	0
yet	0
myself	1

well	1
that's	0
all	0
they	0
got	0
right	0
now	1
that's	0
their	0
ray	0
of	0
hope	1

uh-huh	0

so	1
you	0
know	1
they'll	0
go	0
with	1
you	0
know	1
w[ho]	1
whoever	1
comes	0
through	0
for	0
them	1
i	1

i	1
it	1
it's	0
just	0
that	1
w[hat]	0
the	0
weird	0
thing	0
is	1
is	0
that	0
Gorbachev	1
is	0
the	0
one	0
that	0
opened	0
the	0
floodgates	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
with	0
glasnost	1
and	0
[poistroi[ka]-/perestroika]	1
perestroika	1
and	0
stuff	1
and	0

and	0
i	0
think	0
he's	0
caught	0
between	0
the	0
Old	0
Guard	1
and	1
and	1
the	0
new	1
uh	0
glasnost	1
um	0
i	0
think	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	1
uh	0
escalate	0
to	0
a	0
point	1
where	0
it's	0
out	0
of	0
control	1

um-hum	1

and	0
i	0
think	0
he	0
had	0
to	0
pull	0
in	0
the	0
reins	1
the	0
only	0
way	0
he	0
knew	0
how	1
in	0
order	0
to	0
keep	0
the	0
peace	1
on	0
peace	0
on	0
both	0
sides	1
so	0
i	0
think	0
that's	0
where	1
you	0
know	1
kind	0
of	0
where	0
he's	0
stuck	1
you	0
know	0
what	0
i'm	0
saying	1

yeah	1
uh	0
i	0
understand	1
it	0

and	1
that's	0
the	1
that's	0
the	1
situation	1
that	0
he	0
finds	1
himself	0
in	0
and	0
you	0
know	1
he's	0
a	0
tough	0
guy	1
i	0
mean	0
he's	0
been	0
through	1
it	0
so	0
i	0
have	0
no	0
doubt	0
that	0
he'll	1
i	0
mean	1
y[ou]	0
i	1
i	0
think	0
overall	1
he's	1
been	0
a	1
a	0
good	1
ah	0
figure	0
for	1
the	0
the	0
Soviet	0
Union	1
i	0
mean	0
i	0
think	0
his	0
intentions	1
and	0
his	0
ideals	1
are	1
are	1
uh	0
well	0
intentioned	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
in	0
the	0
long-term	1
but	0
i	0
just	0
think	0
that	1
because	0
of	1
the	0
basic	0
needs	0
that	0
the	0
people	1
don't	0
have	1
i	0
think	0
that	1
that	0
makes	0
the	0
problem	1
most	0
severe	1
and	0
makes	0
him	0
look	1
look	0
worse	1
that	0
what	0
his	1
um	0
what	0
his	0
ideals	0
are	1
personally	1

i	0
agree	1
what's	0
bad	0
for	0
the	1
Soviet	0
system	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
have	0
the	1
resources	0
to	0
grow	1
and	0
produce	0
their	0
food	1
but	0
somehow	0
it	0
just	1
does	0
not	0
get	1
out	1
to	0
the	1
market	1
the	0
way	0
it	1
should	1

i	0
think	0
it's	1
i	0
think	0
it's	0
a	0
lot	1
of	0
uh	0
oh	0
how	0
do	0
you	0
put	0
it	1
bureaucracy	1
and	0
and	0
and	1
uh	0
one	0
thing	1
and	0
then	0
all	0
the	0
corruption	1
i	0
think	0
there's	0
a	1
a	1
a	0
large	0
amount	0
of	0
corruption	1
on	0
the	0
the	0
have	0
and	0
the	0
have	0
nots	1
you	0
know	0
i	1

yeah	1
that's	0
probably	1
more	0
true	1
than	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
realize	1

i	1
i	0
know	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
that	0
with	0
every	0
society	1
at	0

at	0
least	0
we're	0
more	0
blatant	1
about	0
it	0
but	0
it's	0
very	0
secret	1
and	0
it's	0
been	0
going	0
on	0
for	0
years	1
i	0
mean	0
you	0
can't	1
change	0
things	0
overnight	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
but	0
if	0
it	0
gets	0
to	0
a	0
point	0
where	0
people	0
can't	1
survive	1
i	0
mean	0
there's	0
revolution	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
that's	1

it	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
headed	0
in	0
that	0
direction	1
too	0

[laughter-yeah]	0
big	0
time	1
major	1
but	1
you	0
know	0
that's	1
that's	0
what	0
happens	0
when	1
you	0
know	0
the	0
cork	0
blows	1
and	0
you	0
can't	0
handle	0
it	0
anymore	1
i	0
mean	1
that's	1
that's	0
the	0
way	1
the	0
world	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
revolves	1
that	0
way	0

uh-huh	0
well	0
their	0
knowledge	1
with	1
uh	0
better	1
communication	0
processes	1
in	0
this	0
world	1
now	1
that's	0
reached	1
them	0
is	0
more	1
educated	0
than	0
to	0
the	1
uh	0
ways	0
of	0
the	0
western	0
world	1

i	0
really	0
question	1
though	0
how	0
much	0
technology	0
the	0
average	1
Soviet	1
is	0
exposed	0
to	1

and	1
um	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
was	0
a	0
big	1
stepping	0
stone	1
for	0
them	0
to	1
initiate	0
all	0
their	1
righteous	0
ways	1
of	1
changing	0
things	1
to	1

they	1
probably	0
not	0
enough	1
but	1
i'm	0
sure	0
i	0
lot	0
of	0
it's	0
filtered	1
down	0
enough	0
to	0
the	0
common	1
folks	0
that	0
they	0
have	0
gotten	0
wind	1
of	0
what	0
they're	0
missing	0
out	1
on	0

yeah	1
i	0
think	0
they're	0
starting	0
to	0
realize	1
but	0
i	1
i	0
just	0
don't	0
think	0
they	0
have	0
the	1
resources	1
if	0
you	0
were	0
to	0
compare	1
uh	0
the	0
Americans	0
to	0
the	0
Soviets	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
home	0
computers	0
are	0
concerned	1
or	0
fact	1
machines	0
fax	0
machines	1
and	0
cellular	0
phones	1
and	0
state	0
of	0
the	0
art	0
equipment	1
that	0
we	0
are	0
so	0
used	1
to	0
i	0
don't	0
think	0
they	0
even	1
realize	0
what's	0
out	0
there	1
and	0
to	0
what	0
extent	1

yeah	1
i'm	0
sure	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
them	0
are	0
missing	1
those	1
household	0
items	1

yeah	1
all	1
the	0
major	0
conveniences	0
of	0
life	1

yeah	0
what	0
we	0
consider	1
just	0
i	0
don't	1
[laughter-know]	0
normal	0
everyday	0
things	1
to	0
them	0
is	0
real	1
luxury	0
which	0
is	0
unfortunate	0
for	0
them	1

yeah	0

and	1
of	0
course	0
most	0
of	0
us	1
we	0
don't	0
really	0
appreciate	0
what	0
we've	0
got	1
because	0
we've	0
been	0
so	0
used	1
to	0
it	0

this	0
is	0
true	1
this	0
is	0
very	1
true	0
and	0
we	1
it's	0
human	1
it's	0
human	0
nature	0
though	1
to	1
take	0
things	0
for	0
granted	1
and	0
it	0
kind	1
of	0
you	1
know	0
when	0

when	0
you've	1
lost	0
something	1
or	1
or	0
uh	0
uh	0
don't	0
have	0
what	0
other	0
people	0
have	1
that's	0
when	0
you	0
tend	0
to	0
realize	1
you	0
know	1
