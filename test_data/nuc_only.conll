anything	0
because	0
he	0
he	0
just	0

with	0
the	0
that	0
attitude	1
that	0
well	0
if	0

designated	0
areas	1
for	0

smoke	0
and	0
you	0
go	0
in	1
there	0
tha[t]	0
everybody	0
that	0
goes	0
in	0
there	0

she	0
always	1
told	0
me	0
it	0
was	0
because	1
i	0
was	0
still	0
growing	1
and	0
she	0
wasn't	0
going	0
to	0
buy	0
me	0
something	0
i	0
was	0
going	0
to	0

the	0
most	0
expensive	0
clothes	1
out	0
there	0
the	0
the	0
quality	0
is	0
really	0
not	0
that	0
great	1
you	0
know	0
for	0
the	0
price	0
that	0
you	0
pay	1

yeah	1
it	0
it	0
depends	1
on	0
um	1
yeah	0
there's	1
there's	0
always	0
a	0
reason	0
why	1
they're	0
on	0
sale	0

right	1

so	0
that	0
that	0
has	0
a	0
lot	1
to	0
do	0
with	0
it	0

right	0

but	0
um	0
well	1

like	0
i	1
bought	0
i	0
bought	1
the	0
most	0
beautiful	1
sw[eater]	0
uh	0
sweater	1
from	1
uh	0
i	0
believe	0
it	0
was	0
ross	1
dress	0
for	0
less	1

uh-huh	1

and	1
it	0
wa[s]	0
it	0
was	0
really	0
pretty	1
it	0
was	0
just	1
you	1
know	0
it	0
was	0
just	0
plain	1
a	0
plain	1
uh	0
ro[und]	0
you	0
know	0
round	1
uh	0
necked	1
uh	0
sw[eater]	0
sweater	1

uh-huh	1

and	0
it	0

uh	0
like	0

the	0
top	1
you	0
know	0
it	0
had	1
uh	0
leather	1
leather	0
designs	1
and	0
um	0
some	1
othe[r]	0
other	0
little	0
things	1
on	1
it	1
and	0
i	1
just	0
thought	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
pretty	1
and	0
i	0
go[t]	0
i	0
got	0
it	0
at	0
a	0
real	1
good	0
price	1
i	0
think	0
maybe	0
it	0
was	0
nine	0
ninety	0
nine	1
or	0
something	0

oh	1
that's	0
great	1

and	1
it	0
was	0
so	0
pretty	1
and	1
after	0
i	0
wore	0
it	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
times	1
i	0
realized	1
why	1
[laughter-it]	0
[laughter-was]	0
why	1
it	0
was	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1

huh	0
oh	1

there	0
was	0
in	0
the	0
middle	0
of	0
the	0
back	1
of	0
it	0
there	1
was	0
it's	0
like	1
there	0
it	0
had	0
been	0
slit	1
and	0
they	0
had	1
like	0
just	0
sewed	0
it	0
back	0
together	1
right	0
in	0
the	0
middle	1
of	0
[laughter-the]	0
the	0
back	1
you	0
know	0
wasn't	0

oh	0
no	1

wasn't	0
a	0
seam	0
or	0
anything	1
you	0
know	0

uh-huh	1

and	0
that's	0
why	0
it	0
was	0
so	0
cheap	1
although	0
it's	0
not	1
it's	0
not	0
really	0
noticeable	1
um	0
from	0
the	1
outside	1
but	1
but	1
still	1
it's	0
you	1
know	0
it's	0
really	1
not	1
not	0
not	0
a	0
good	1
quality	1

and	0
then	0
i	0
was	0
told	1
by	0
somebody	1
that	0
works	0
for	0
jc	0
penney's	1
that	0
um	0
ross	1
ross	1
is	0
just	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
places	0
that	0
sell[s]	0
sells	1
seconds	1

the	0
defect	1

yeah	1
yeah	1
um	0
they	0
don't	0
really	0
buy	0
the	0
first	0
quality	1
they	0
buy	0
the	0
[laughter-second]	1
and	1
uh	0
places	0
like	0
jc	0
penney's	1
that	0
they'll	0
reject	1
the	0
seconds	0
they'll	0
send	0
them	0
back	1
every	0
time	1
but	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
places	0
like	0
ross	1
dress	0
for	0
less	1
and	0
uh	0
tj	0
max	1

tj	0
max	1
does	0
that	0
yeah	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0
we	0
have	0
a	0
tj	0
max	0
over	0
here	1
and	0
um	0

i'll	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
first	1

oh	0
well	1
what's	1
there	0
to	0
say	1
doesn't	0
seem	1
like	0
it's	0
being	1
carried	0
out	1
very	0
well	1
in	0
my	0
opinion	1
seems	1
like	0
it	1
takes	1
so	0
long	1
between	1
conviction	1
and	0
carrying	0
out	1
the	1
penalty	1
that	0
i	0
don't	1
see	0
that	1
it	1
makes	0
any	1
difference	1
to	1
sentence	0
anybody	1

yeah	0
it	1
seems	1
like	1
they	1
could	0
die	0
of	0
old	0
age	1
waiting	1
to	1
get	0
the	0
death	1
penalty	0

yeah	1

yeah	1
i	1
know	0
what	1
you	0
mean	1
um	1
i	0
in	1
maryland	1
they	1
they	1
do	0
have	1
capital	0
punishment	1

yeah	0

and	0
uh	0
i've	0
seen	1
uh	1
a	1
lot	0
of	0
people	1
get	0
convicted	1
sentenced	1
and	0
then	0
just	1
nothing	1
happens	0
just	1
endless	1
endless	1
endless	0
appeals	1

yeah	0

uh-huh	0
well	0
from	0
what	0
i	1
underst[and]	0
i	0
saw	0
a	1
statistic	1
just	0
a	0
few	0
days	0
ago	1
um	1
so	1
far	0
this	0
ye[ar]	0
year	1
or	0
was	0
it	0
during	0
the	0
last	1
year	1
somewh[ere]	1
during	0
a	0
years	0
time	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
was	0
they	0
executed	1
twenty	0
five	1
people	0
in	0
the	0
nation	1
meanwhile	0
there	1
were	1
twenty	0
five	1
hundred	0
people	0
on	0
death	0
row	1

so	0
i	0
i	0
and	0
it's	0
building	0
up	0
you	0
know	0
they're	0
they're	1
convicting	1
them	0
faster	1
than	0
they're	0
executing	1
them	0
so	0
it's	0
really	0
building	0
up	1

yeah	0
what's	0
amazing	0
is	0
some	0
of	1
them	1
have	0
been	1
on	1
death	0
row	1
for	0
a	0
number	1
of	0
years	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	1
here	0
in	0
maryland	0
i	0
know	1
we	0
have	0
a	1
real	1
problem	0
with	0
overcrowding	0
in	1
prisons	1
uh	0
just	1

yeah	1
everybody's	1
got	1
that	0

yeah	0
but	0
i	0
mean	0
in	0
here	1
it's	0
uh	1
to	0
the	1
point	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
letting	1
prisoners	1
go	1
uh	0
commuting	0
the	0
sentences	1
of	0
those	1
that	0
were	0
in	1
in	1
jail	1
for	1
lesser	1
crimes	1
in	1
order	1
to	0
put	1
more	0
people	0
in	1
into	1
the	0
jails	1
and	0

uh-huh	0

yeah	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
it	0
was	1
just	1
uh	1
amazing	1
to	1
me	1
and	0
of	0
course	1
they	1
made	0
a	0
big	0
deal	1
out	1
of	0
the	1
the	1
few	1
that	0
got	1
out	1
and	1
turned	1
around	1
and	0
committed	0
a	0
crime	1
within	0
five	0
days	1
of	0
getting	0
out	1
and	0
being	0
rearrested	1
and	0

yeah	0

isn't	0
isn't	0
maryland	1
where	0
the	0
famous	0
willy	0
horton	1
case	0
was	0

uh	0
i	0
can't	1
remember	0
refresh	0
my	1
memory	0

it	0
was	0
uh	0
that	0
was	0
the	0
one	0
that	0
was	0
used	0
so	0
much	0
in	0
the	0
campaign	1
in	0
the	0
politica[l]	1
in	0
the	0
presidential	1
race	0
uh	0
may	1
it	0
may	0
not	1
have	0
been	0
maryland	1
it	0
may	0
have	0
been	0
massachusetts	1
i	0
don't	1
remember	0

um	0
i	0
don't	0
remember	0
myself	1

anyway	1
well	0
the	0
question	0
is	1
you	0
know	1
do	1
you	0
think	1
i[t]	0
it	1
does	1
make	0
a	0
difference	0
in	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
a	0
criminal	1
commits	0
a	0
crime	1
or	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
it	0
can	1
if	0
it's	0
done	0
right	1

um	1
i	1
think	1
if	0
they	1
if	1
they	0
started	0
executing	1
them	1
on	0
a	1
regular	0
basis	1
uh	0
that	1
i	0
think	1
it	0
might	1
make	1
a	0
difference	1
right	0
now	1
i	1
don't	0
see	1
it	0
making	0
a	1
difference	1
i	0

if	0
it	0

i	0
don't	1
see	0
someone	1
not	0
going	0
out	1
there	0
and	1
committing	0
murder	1
because	1
they're	1
afraid	1
they're	0
going	1
to	0
get	1
sentenced	0
to	0
death	1
i	0
mean	1
most	0
people	1
out	0
there	0
committing	0
murders	1
like	1
don't	0
care	1

uh-huh	0

they	0
just	1
don't	0
care	0

yeah	0
well	1
i	0
think	0
in	0
large	1
measure	0
the	0
reason	0
they	0
don't	0
care	1
it's	0
not	0
because	0
the	0
punishment	0
but	0
so	0
many	1
of	0
the	0
people	0
that	0
commit	0
crimes	1
don't	0
get	0
punished	1

yeah	0

the	0
police	0
don't	0
catch	1
them	0
or	0
the	0
courts	0
don't	0
convict	1
them	0
or	1
or	0
they	0
don't	1
serve	0
very	0
much	0
of	0
the	0
time	1
and	0
so	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
their	0
their	0
success	0
rate	0
is	0
very	0
high	0
crime	0
does	0
pay	0
ca[sh]	0
you	0
can	0
make	0
a	0
good	0
living	1
at	0
it	0

yeah	0
yeah	0
and	0
there's	1
uh	0
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
here	0
in	0
baltimore	1
that	0
uh	0
have	1
and	0
we	0
just	0
had	1
uh	1
a	0
real	0
big	1
cocaine	0
bust	1
and	1
of	0
course	1
you	0
know	0
they're	1
they're	0
playing	0
it	0
up	0
real	0
big	1
that	0
it	0
was	0
uh	1
looked	1
like	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
very	1
very	0
small	0
ring	1
and	0
they	0
just	0
happened	1
to	0
get	0
lucky	1
and	0
catch	1
the	0
guy	0

yeah	0

but	0
i	0
mean	1
uh	0
baltimore	0
has	1
uh	0
an	0
all	0
time	0
record	1
for	0
the	0
number	1
of	0
deaths	1
so	0
far	1
this	0
year	1
i	0
think	0
they've	0
got	0
over	0
a	0
hundred	0
dead	1
already	1
this	0
year	0

last	0
year	0
it	1
was	1
dc	1
i	1
guess	0
baltimore	0
caught	1
them	0

well	0
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
it's	0
kind	0
of	0
moved	0
up	1
and	1
you	0
have	0
to	0
remember	1
that	0
it	0
it	0
it	0
uh	0
there's	1
i	0
think	1
x	0
number	0
of	0
people	1
out	0
there	0
that	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
commit	0
murders	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
uh	0
once	0
you	0
kill	0
off	1
a	0
few	1
of	1
them	0

yeah	0

i	0
mean	1
if	0
you	0
murder	0
a	0
guy	1
because	0
he	0
murdered	1
your	0
partner	0
or	1
something	0
like	0
that	1
i	0
mean	0
pretty	0
soon	1
you	0
run	0
out	0
of	0
people	0
to	0
murder	1

yeah	0
the	0
only	0
consolation	1
is	0
so	0
many	0
of	0
the	0
murders	1
are	0
you	0
know	1
the	0
the	0
violent	1
people	0
going	0
against	0
each	0
other	1
and	0
so	0
they	0
you	0
know	0
society's	1
not	0
going	0
to	0
put	0
them	0
to	0
death	0
well	0
at	0
least	1
maybe	0
the	0
guy	0
they	0
cross	1
next	0
time	0
is	0
going	1
to	0
uh	0
i	0
think	1
i	0
think	1
capital	1
punishment	0
is	0
an	0
appropriate	1
punishment	0
for	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
people	1
where	0
we	0
say	0
you	0
know	0
this	1
sort	0
of	0
person	0
is	0
just	0
not	0
acceptable	1
to	0
our	0
society	1
and	0
we	0
are	0
there	0
by	1
going	0
to	0
remove	0
them	0
from	0
society	1
not	0
temporarily	1
but	0
permanently	1

yeah	0

i	0
mean	0
i	0
i	0
personally	0
think	0
life	0
imprisonment	0
i	1
don't	0
think	0
much	0
of	0
li[fe]	0
of	0
life	0
imprisonment	1
first	1
of	0
all	0
it's	0
never	0
turns	0
out	0
to	0
be	0
life	1
but	0
second	0
you	0
know	0
why	0
should	0
we	0
the	0
idea	0
of	0
life	0
imprisonment	0
with	0
no	0
chance	0
of	0
parole	0
well	0
that	1
means	0
you're	0
going	0
to	0
put	0
them	0
in	0
a	0
cage	1
you	0
think	0
it's	0
never	1
ever	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
safe	1
for	0
them	0
to	0
walk	0
the	0
streets	0
again	1
well	0
then	0
why	0
bother	0
just	1
execute	1
them	0
because	1
that's	0
that	0
way	0
you're	0
sure	1
they'll	0
never	0
ever	1
going	0
to	1
walk	0
the	0
streets	0
again	1

yeah	0

so	0
any	1
any	1
anybody	0
that	1
says	1
life	0
in	0
prison	1
with	0
no	0
chance	0
of	0
parole	1
i'd	0
say	1
uh	0
give	0
them	0
the	0
death	0
penalty	1
so	0

yeah	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
makes	0
sense	1
um	0
you	0
know	1
you	0
have	0
the	0
occasional	0
person	1
who	0
may	0
have	0
been	0
falsely	0
accused	1
but	0
i	0
mean	0
uh	0
so	1
few	0
and	0
far	0
between	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
makes	0
good	1
tv	0
movies	1
and	1
that's	1
about	0
it	1

yeah	0
and	0
and	0
also	1
um	0
the	0
the	0
thing	1
i	0
don't	0
like	0
about	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
these	0
court	0
trials	1
and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
these	0
appeals	1
is	0
that	0
it's	0
not	0
based	0
on	1
what	0
is	0
true	1
and	0
what	0
is	0
false	1
but	0
rather	0
it's	0
on	1
the	0
rules	0
of	0
evidence	1
what	0
can	0
i	0
hide	1
and	0
what	0
do	0
i	0
have	0
to	0
tell	1

yeah	0

and	0
i	0
think	1
our	0
courts	0
should	0
be	0
geared	1
much	0
more	0
strongly	1
towards	0
finding	0
out	0
the	0
truth	1
than	0
they	0
currently	0
are	1

yeah	0

and	0
and	1
that	0
way	0
we	0
can	0
be	0
sure	0
you	0
know	0
we	0
can	0
find	0
out	0
the	0
truth	1
we	0
can	1
find	0
out	0
what	0
really	0
happened	1
and	0
and	0
base	1
the	0
ver[dict]	0
sentence	1
on	0
what	0
the	0
person	0
did	1
not	0
on	1
what	1
we're	0
allowed	1
to	0
let	0
the	0
jury	0
hear	1

yeah	0
i	0
had	0
my	1
uh	0
my	0
father-in-law	1
participated	0
in	1
a	0
uh	0
a	0
jury	0
trial	1
he	0
was	0
he	0
was	0
actually	0
on	0
the	0
jury	1

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
this	1
man	0
was	1
accused	0
of	0
killing	1
uh	0
i	1
think	1
it	0
was	1
two	1
people	0
uh	1
and	1
shooting	1
a	0
uh	0
policeman	1
um	0
point	0
blank	0
in	0
the	0
face	1
of	0
course	0
he	1
didn't	1
die	0

uh-huh	0

and	1
uh	0
this	0
was	0
during	1
a	0
holdup	1
of	0
a	1
uh	0
uh	0
a	0
restaurant	1
and	0
it	0
came	0
out	1
during	0
the	0
trial	1
that	1
um	0
they	0
had	0
tried	1
to	0
rob	0
another	1
place	0
and	1
uh	0
when	0
the	1
guy	1
came	1
out	1
with	0
the	0
bag	1

turned	0
out	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
couple	0
cookies	1
and	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
jumbo	0
cookies	1
and	0
and	0
so	0
they	0
were	0
so	0
upset	1
from	0
robbing	1
this	0
guy	0
you	0
know	0
trying	0
to	0
do	0
this	0
holdup	1
that	0
didn't	0
work	1
that	0
they	0
quite	1
literally	1
were	0
mad	1
and	0
went	0
into	0
a	0
restaurant	1
to	0
hold	0
the	0
place	0
up	1
and	0
just	0
started	1
you	0
know	0
shooting	1
people	0

just	0
started	1
shooting	1
people	0
because	0
they	0
botched	0
the	0
first	1
job	0
and	0

you	0
know	0
it's	0

and	0
so	0
now	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
get	0
even	0

yeah	0

yeah	0
and	0
get	0
even	0
with	0
who	0
i	0
[laughter-mean]	0
you	0

yeah	0

you	0
know	0
stupid	0
guys	0
and	1
uh	0
it	0
turned	0
out	1
that	0
the	0
you	0
know	0
policeman	0
survived	1
to	0
the	0
point	0
that	0
he	0
was	0
able	1
to	0
you	0
know	0
identify	1
the	0
guy	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
of	0
course	1
you	0
know	0
they	0
tried	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
cop	1
look	0
ou[t]	0
like	0
he	1
was	0
uh	0
a	0
uh	0
no	0
good	0
rotten	0
drunk	1

yeah	0

i	0
mean	0
it	0
was	0
amazing	0

so	0
what	0
was	0
the	0
verdict	1
what	0
was	0
the	0
results	1
there	0

oh	0
he	0
was	1
found	0
guilty	1
yeah	0

oh	0

he	0
uh	0
um	0
last	0
i	0
heard	1
he	1
uh	0
he	1
beat	1
a	0
push	1
for	0
the	0
death	1
penalty	0
now	0
whether	1
they	1
finally	0
got	1
it	0
or	0
not	1
i	0
don't	0
know	1
i	0

uh-huh	0

i	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	1
stopped	1
listening	0
after	0
a	0
while	1

uh-huh	0

um	1
you	0
know	0
he	0
would	0
come	0
home	1
and	1
and	1
you	0
know	0
after	0
the	0
trial	1
was	0
over	0
he	0
came	0
home	1
and	0
told	0
us	0
what	0
was	0
going	0
on	1
and	0
of	0
course	1
then	0
they	0
had	0
to	0
go	0
back	1
to	0
dec[ide]	1
you	0
know	1
after	0
he	0
had	0
to	0
go	0

the	0
the	0
penalty	0
phase	0
yeah	0
they've	0
decide	0
the	0
penalty	1
separately	0
from	0
the	0
verdict	1

right	0
and	1
uh	0
yeah	0
everybody	1
everybody	1
was	0
pretty	0
much	1
you	0
know	0
let's	0
burn	1
him	0

uh-huh	0

and	0
that's	0
you	0
know	0
that's	0
the	0
way	1
they	0
wanted	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
and	1
he	0
was	0
surprised	1
because	0
he	0
thought	0
there	0
was	0
going	1
to	0
be	0
a	0
problem	1
because	0
he	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
some	0
people	0
on	0
the	0
case	1
were	0
were	0
a	0
little	1
hesitant	1
on	1
convicting	1
him	0
on	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
charges	1
but	1
i	0
mean	1
when	0
it	0
all	0
came	0
down	1
they	0
just	0
within	0
an	0
hour	1
decided	0
the	0
man's	0
fate	1

yeah	0
well	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
decide	0
you	0
know	0
wha[t]	0
you	0
well	1
yeah	1
there's	0
really	0
two	1
separate	0
decisions	1
there	0
i	0
guess	1
one	1
is	0
did	0
it	0
really	0
happen	1
the	0
way	1
the	0
the	0
prosecutor	0
said	1
it	0
happened	0
you	0
know	0
is	0
this	0
man	0
really	0
guilty	0
and	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
decide	0
that	1
but	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
decide	1
you	0
know	1
as	1
a	0
member	0
of	0
society	1
what	0
do	0
i	0
want	0
to	0
do	1
with	0
this	0
guy	0
who	0
did	1
this	0
thing	0

yeah	0

and	0
that	0
w[ill]	0
i	1
i've	0
never	0
been	1
on	0
a	0
jury	0
i've	0
never	0
had	0
that	0
experience	1
i'm	1
not	0
sure	0
i'd	0
look	0
forward	1
to	0
making	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
decision	1
about	0
a	0
man's	0
life	1

hm	0
yeah	0
well	0
it	1
it	1
it	0
went	0
pretty	1
pretty	0
quick	1
from	0
what	0
he	0
said	1

uh-huh	0

but	0
i	0
mean	0
there's	1
there's	1
there's	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
other	0
crimes	1
out	0
there	0
i	0
mean	0
besides	0
murder	1
i	0
think	0
uh	1
now	1
if	0
you're	0
dealing	0
drugs	1
now	0
caught	0
more	0
than	0
twice	1
or	0
something	1
uh	1
it	0
there's	1
uh	0
a	0
death	1
penalty	0
associated	1
with	0
it	0

yeah	0

yeah	0

well	1
the	0
thing	0
i'd	1
be	0
most	0
likely	0
to	0
attach	0
the	0
death	0
penalty	0
to	0
is	0
the	0
violence	1
i	0
mean	0
ye[ah]	0
i	0
can	0
handle	1
people	1
people	1
selling	1
drugs	0
you	0
know	1
it's	0
it's	0
wrong	0
but	1
it	1
it's	0
not	1
worth	0
somebody	1
getting	1
executed	1
for	0
but	1
we	0
hear	0
so	0
much	0
about	0
the	0
violence	1
and	0
how	0
it's	0
not	0
safe	1
to	0
walk	0
the	0
streets	1
because	0
somebody	1
you	0
know	1
these	0
random	0
drive	0
by	0
shootings	1
and	0
that	0
sort	0
of	0
thing	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
the	0
people	0
i'd	1
most	0
likely	0
want	0
to	0
sentence	0
to	0
death	1
are	0
the	0
people	0
that	0
just	0
show	0
a	0
really	1
low	0
regard	1
for	0
human	0
life	1
that	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
never	0
know	1
when	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
turn	0
or	0
hurt	0
the	0
next	0
person	1
because	0
it	0
doesn't	0
really	0
matter	1
to	0
them	0
whether	0
someone	0
else	0
gets	0
hurt	0
or	0
not	1

yeah	0
yeah	0
i	0
agree	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
go	0
le[t's]	0
you	0
know	0
these	1
are	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
people	0
i	0
would	0
like	1
to	0
ye[ah]	0
get	0
out	1
of	0
here	0
and	0
get	0
out	0
of	0
circulation	1
and	0
say	0
i	0
don't	1
we	0
don't	0
accept	1
your	0
kind	0
in	0
our	0
society	1

yeah	0
i	0
agree	0
i	1
i've	1
i	0
have	0
uh	1
a	0
low	0
tolerance	1
for	0
that	0
kind	1
of	0
uh	1
that	1
kind	0
of	0
person	1
and	0
uh	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
uh	0
you	0
know	0
there	0
are	1
some	0
some	0
other	0
crimes	1
that	0
i	0
think	1
uh	0
you	0
know	1
kidnapping	0
um	0
you	0
know	0
when	0
they	0
i	0
mean	1
kidnapping	0
per	0
se	1
has	1
a	0
certain	1
uh	0
uh	0
fine	1
and	0
penalty	0
associated	1
with	0
it	0
but	1

uh-huh	0

but	1
um	1
some	0
of	0
these	0
people	1
are	0
just	0
out	0
and	1
out	1
brutal	1
i	0
some	0
of	0
the	1
cases	1
i've	0
heard	0
about	0
over	1
the	1
years	1

well	1
what	0
would	1
you	1
have	1
at	1
a	0
dinner	0
party	1

well	1
uh	1
lately	1
since	1
i	0
have	1
children	1
i've	0
cut	1
down	1
on	1
having	0
dinner	0
parties	1
but	0

uh-huh	1

but	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
i	0
try	1
to	1
keep	0
it	0
pretty	0
simple	1
on	0
things	0
that	0
i	0
can	0
prepare	0
ahead	0
of	0
time	1
uh	1
i	0
have	1
one	0
recipe	0
for	0
uh	1
a	0
really	0
good	1
um	0
type	0
of	0
a	1
meatball	1
it's	1
called	0
burgundy	0
meatballs	1
and	0
it's	0
made	1
with	1
r[ed]	0
red	0
wine	1
and	1
um	1

oh	1
gosh	1
that	0
sounds	1
great	1

um	1

it's	0
it's	0
really	1
good	0
and	1
you	0
can	1
make	0
it	1
ahead	0
of	0
time	1
and	1
then	1
um	0
make	1
the	1
sauce	1
when	0
you're	0
ready	1
to	1
um	0
to	1
serve	1
it	0

uh-huh	1

that's	0
one	0
of	1
my	0
favorite	0
things	1
to	0
to	0
serve	1

well	0
um	0
i	0
think	0
it	0
would	0
probably	0
depend	0
on	0
whether	0
this	1
was	1
a	0
formal	1
or	0
informal	1
dinner	0
party	1

sure	1

but	1
if	0
it	1
was	0
informal	1
my	0
first	0
choice	0
would	0
be	0
crawfish	1

oh	0
really	1
well	1
i	0
guess	0
being	0
from	1
that	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
country	1

because	1
i	1
mean	0
crawfish	1
everybody	1
over	0
here	1
likes	0
crawfish	0
but	1
you	1
know	0
i	1
i	0
wouldn't	1
have	1
to	0
worry	0
about	0
satisfying	0
my	1
guest	1

uh-huh	1

but	0
if	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
formal	1
uh	0
dinner	0
party	1
i	0
would	0
probably	0
think	0
of	0
something	0
else	1
like	0
um	0
shrimp	1
shrimp	0
fettucini	0
is	0
real	0
easy	1
to	0
um	0
make	1
and	0
everything	1
and	0

yeah	1

and	0
it's	0
usually	0
well	0
liked	0
by	0
people	1
i	0
guess	1
i'm	0
just	0
a	0
seafood	0
fan	1
so	0
i	0
think	0
on	0
the	0
lines	1
oh	0

well	1
how	0
do	0
you	0
make	1
how	0
do	1
you	1
you	0
cook	0
crawfish	1
i	0

i	0
in	1
fact	1
i	0
just	0
came	0
back	0
from	0
the	0
grocery	0
store	1
and	1
being	0
in	0
texas	1
we	0
don't	0
have	0
too	1
many	0
you	1
know	0
people	0
that	1
that	1
eat	1
crawfish	1
but	1
they	0
had	0
live	0
crawfish	1
on	0
sale	1

oh	0
yeah	1
um	1

um	1
you're	1
not	0
supposed	1
to	0
i	1
mean	1
you're	1
not	0
supposed	0
to	0
eat	1
them_1	1
dead	1
i	1
mean	1
well	0
you	0
eat	1
them_1	0
dead	0
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0

don't	0
buy	0
them_1	0
that	1
way	1

right	1
because_1	1
if	0
if	0
they're	0
dead	0
for	0
too	0
long	1
you	0
can	0
always	0
tell	0
whenever	1
they're	0
cooked	1
if	1
they've	1
been	1
dead	0
for	0
a	1
long	1
time	1
because_1	0
their	1
tail	1
straightens	1
out	0

uh-huh	1

and	1
you're	0
not	0
supposed	0
to	0
eat	1
those	0
because_1	1
they're	0
the	1
bad	1
for	0
you	1

okay	1
well	0
i'll	0
remember	1
that	1

yeah	1
so	1
if	0
you	0
ever	1
go	0
in	0
a	0
restaurant	1
and	0
order	1
crawfish	1
i	0
mean	1
every	0
once	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
you'll	0
see	1
o[ne]	0
i	0
mean	1
it	0
doesn't	0
happen	0
very	0
often	1
because	0
it's	0
just	0
an	0
accident	1
but	0
if	0
the	0
tail	0
is	0
straight	1
on	0
it	1
then	0
yeah	0
don't	0
eat	1
it	1

uh-huh	1

but	1
um	0
you	0
just	1
put	0
some	0
cajun	1
well	0
lots	0
of	1
pepper	1

uh-huh	0

and	0
you	1
just	0
boil	1
them	1
and	0
they're	0
absolutely	0
wonderful	1
but	0
there's	1
uh	1
they're	1
a	0
pain	0
to	1
peel	1
for	1
some	1
people	1
once	0
you	1
get	0
used	1
to	1
it	0
they're	1
real	1
easy	1
but	1
um	0
you	1
know	1
if	0
you	0
have	0
nails	1
or	0
anything	0
you	0
can	1
plan	0
on	1
those	0
being	1
shot	1

when	0
you	0
were	1
um	0
whe[n]	1
when	0
you	1
serve	1
it	0
do	0
you	1
shell	1
them	0
and	0
then	0
serve	1
them	0
to	1

i	1
think	1
for	0
a	0
dinner	0
party	1
i	1
i	1
don't	0
know	0
it	0
depends	1

um-hum	1

like	1
if	0
like	1
my	1
age	1
if	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
bunch	0
of	0
college	0
kids	1
coming	0
over	1
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	1
no	0
i	1
they	0
would	0
shell	0
their	0
own	1
you	1

sure	1

you	1
know	0
we'd	0
just	0
have	0
crawfish	1
and	0
beer	0
or	0
something	1
but	1
um	1
if	0
it	0
was	0
more	0
formal	1
like	0
if	0
i	0
was	0
you	0
know	1
working	0
environment	1
then	1
i	0
would	0
probably	1
um	1
sh[ell]	1
shell	1
them_1	0
or	0
at	1
least	1
disconnect	0
them	0
from	0
the	0
head	1
but	0
there's	1
a	0
there's	0
a	0
big	0
thing	0
over	0
here	1
that	0
everybody	0
sucks	1
the	0
head	1

so	0
they	0
don't	0
have	0
see	1
that	0
ooh	1

so	1
um	0
it	0
it	0
would	0
just	0
depend	1
that's	0

that's	0
the	0
best	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
crawfish	1

sucking	0
the	0
head	1
but	1
um	0
i	0
don't	0
know	1
it	1
just	1
i[t]	1
it	0
just	0
depended	1
on	0
what	0
type	0
it	0
was	1
i	1
guess	1
but	0
you	0
can	1
buy	1
uh	1
the	0
crawfish	0
tails	1
already	0
peeled	0
an[d]	0
everything	1
and	0
usually	1
you	1
use	1
those	1
like	1
for	1
frying	1
or	1
to	0
put	0
in	1
salads	1
or	1
to	0
um	1
you	1
know	0
make	0
a	0
sauce	1
with	0
or	0
something	0
like	1
that	1
but	0

um-hum	1

but	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
ahead	0
and	0
buy	1
them_1	0
cooked	1
and	0
shelled	1
and	0
they're	0
more	0
expensive	1
of	0
course	0
but	1

does	0
it	1
taste	1
a	0
lot	0
like	0
shrimp	1

um	1
yeah	0
it	0
really	0
does	1
i	0
like	0
shrimp	0
better	1

uh-huh	1

yeah	1

just	1
um	1
but	1
crawfish	1
i	1
mean	0
it	1
just	1
has	0
a	0
taste	0
of	0
its	0
own	1
it	0
also	0
depends	1
on	0
who's	0
cooking	1
it	0
and	1
how	0
much	0
seasoning	0
they	0
use	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	1
that	0
but	0

sure	1

but	0
um	0
i	0
think	0
that	1
and	0
also	1
to	0
get	1
totally	0
off	0
c[rawfish]	0
the	0
subject	0
of	0
crawfish	1
lots	0
of	0
vegetables	1
and	0
hors	0
d'oeuvres	1
and	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	0
for	0
a	0
dinner	1
party	0
i	0
think	0
that	0
that	0
really	0
helps	1

yeah	1
we	1
have	0
a	0
a	0
friend	1
another	0
couple	0
where	0
the	0
husband	0
is	0
the	0
one	0
who	0
cooks	1
all	0
the	0
time	1

and	1

that's	0
what	1
i	0
need	1

yeah	0
that's	0
what	0
i	0
wish	0
i	0
had	1
but	0
in	0
our	1
family	1
i'm	0
the	0
one	0
who	1
who	0
cooks	1
and	0
i	1
i	1
really	0
enjoy	1
it	0
it's	0
gotten	0
a	1
little	0
more	0
difficult	0
with	0
kids	1
but	1
i	0
really	0
do	0
enjoy	0
cooking	1
and	0
we	1
um	0
we	0
have	0
them	1
over	1
for	0
dinner	1
back	0

forth	0
quite	0
a	0

before	0
i	0
had	0
my	0
second	0
child	1
we	0
sort	0
of	0
had	0
a	0
contest	1
going	0
where	1
you	0
know	0
he	1
would	0
cook	1
and	0
then	0
the	0
next	0
time	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
my	0
turn	1
and	0
i'd	0
try	0
to	0
outdo	0
him	1
and	0
then	0
he'd	0
try	0
to	0
outdo	0
me	1
and	0

really	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
and	0

i	0
bet	0
that	1

and	0

that	1
that	0
got	0
pretty	1
competitive	1
you	0
know	1
as	0
far	0
as	0
who	0
could	0
come	0
up	0
with	0
the	0
best	0
recipe	1

yeah	0

it	0
did	1
and	1

we	1
we	1
tried	0
to	1
be	1
fancier	1
or	0
more	0
courses	0
than	1
the	0
other	1
or	1

that	0
would	1
be	0
fun	1

or	1

it	0
was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
you	1
know	1
it	0
something	1
unique	1
you	0
know	1
and	0
then	0
we	0
got	0
into	1
different	1
um	0
themes	1
you	0
know	0
um	0
whether	0
it	0
would	0
be	1
ethnic	1
food	1
or	1
um	0
sometimes	0
it	0
would	0
be	1
um	0
oh	1
oh	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
maybe	0
an	0
outdoor	0
theme	1
or	1
uh	0
uh	0
elegant	1
theme	0
or	0
you	0
know	1

uh	0
huh	1

it	0
was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1

sometimes	0
it	0
might	0
be	0
the	0
candlelight	1
and	0
sometimes	0
it	0
might	0
be	0
the	0
picnic	1
out	1
back	0
or	1
something	0

that's	0
right	1

well	1
that's	1
you	1
know	1

dinner	1
one	1
time	0
uh	0
just	1
to	0
even	0

be	1
unfairly	0
doing	0
all	0
the	0
cooking	1
and	0
they	0
were	0
doing	0
all	0
the	0

except	0
that	0
knowing	0
them	0

would	0
probably	0
do	0
something	1
ridiculous	0
and	0
terrible	1
just	0
just	0
to	1
uh	0
make	0
sure	1
that	0
they	0
didn't	0

room	1
i	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
we	0
have	0
enough	1
time	1
for	0
it	0
it's	0

oh	1

it's	0
real	0
easy	1
one	0
of	0
the	0
unique	0
things	1
in	0
this	0
like	0
a	0
pound	0
of	0
ground	0
beef	1
some	0
bread	0
crumbs	1
um	0
an	0
egg	1
um	0
um	0

just	0
light	0
seasonings	1

pepper	1
um	0
and	0
chopped	0
up	0
water	0
chestnuts	1
which	0
is	0
something	0
different	1
um	0

oh	1

them	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
crunchy	1
you	0
need	0
to	0
chop	0
them_1	0
up	0
real	0
fine	1

yeah	1

but	1
um	1
it	0
makes	0
them	0
crunchy	1
and	0
that	0
adds	0
something	1
new	0
to	0
it	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
sauce	0
is	0
just	0
made	1
with	0
um	0
bouillon	1
cubes	1
water	1
burgundy	0
wine	1
and	1
um	0
cornstarch	1
instead	0
of	0
flour	1

um-hum	1

oh	1

so	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
it's	0
not	1
a	0
thick	1
rich	0
type	0
of	0
a	0
sauce	1
it's	0
more	1
of	0
a	1
when	0
you	0
use	0
corn	0
starch	1
in	0
in	0
gravy	1
like	0
you	0
know	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
um	0
chinese	1
food	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
a	0
gravy	1
or	0
a	0
sauce	1
that	0
comes	0
with	1
a	0
lot	0
of	0
that	1
they	0

corn	0
starch	0
instead	0
of	0
flour	1
in	0
all	0
of	0
their	0
sauces	0
and	0
gravies	1

um-hum	1

and	0
it	0
gives	0
it	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
different	0
consistency	1

well	0
um	0
how	0
long	0
do	0
you	1
cook	0
the	0
meatballs	1

the	0
meatballs	0
you	0
just	1
um	0
after	0
you	1
form	1

sides	1
and	0

uh	0

and	0
then	0
drain	0
off	0
all	0
the	0
grease	1
uh	0
then	0
what	0
i	0
usually	0

is	0
i	0
freeze	1
them	0
and	0
then	1
when	0
you're	0
ready	1
to	0
serve	1
them	0
then	0
you	0
cook	0
the	0
sauce	1
and	0
then	0
put	0
the	1
meatballs	0
into	1
the	0
sauce	0
and	1
heat	1
it	0
probably	0

up	0
for	0
a	0
good	1
oh	1
if	0

but	0
that	0
purple	0
ball	0

okay	1
um	0
i	1
guess	1
um	0
this	0
is	0
probably	1
really	0
a	1
good	1
subject	1
for	0
me	0
because	1
i	0
really	0
like	1
to	1
do	1
uh	1
hand	0
work	1
uh	0
mostly	1
i	1
do	1
needlepoint	0
i	1
guess	1

oh	0
really	1

but	1
um	1

what	1
kinds	0
of	0
things	1
have	0
you	1
done	1

um	1
well	0
i've	1
made	0
a	1
lot	0
of	1
baby	1
gifts	1

aha	0

it	1
seem	0
like	1
that's	0
like	0
especially	0
lately	1
there's	0
been	0
so	1
many	1
babies	1
that	1
uh	1
bibs	0
and	0
blankets	0
and	0
things	1
like	0
that	0
wall	1
hangings	0
um	0

do	1
you	0
ever	0
keep	0
any	0
of	1
your	0
stuff	1

isn't	1
that	0
funny	1
no	1

i	0
do	0
crochet	1
and	0
a	0
lot	0
of	1
uh	0
things	0
like	1
that	1
and	0
i	0
have	0
very	1
little	0
of	0
my	0
own	0
stuff	1
and	0
and	0
it	1
it's	0
kind	1
of	0
embarrassing	0
people	0
say	0
let	0
me	0
see	1
some	0
of	1
your	0
work	1

oh	1
well	1
can	0
you	0
go	1
to	1
so	0
and	0

yeah	0
isn't	0
that	0
funny	1
i	0
guess	1
i	1
do	1
have	0
one	0
thing	0
um	0
a	0
friend	1
of	0
mine	1
gave	0
me	0
a	0
clock	1
kit	0
and	1

ooh	1

and	1
i	1
i	1
needlepointed	1
the	0
the	1
face	1
and	1
i	1
uh	0
kept	0
that	1
because	0
she	1
gave	1
me	0
that	1
so	0

that	1
that	0
would	1
be	1
definitely	1
something	1
you'd	0
want	0
to	0
keep	0

oh	1
yeah	0
and	0
it's	0
real	0
neat	0

was	1
was	0
the	1
whole	1
face	1
done	0
or	0
just	1
the	0
numbers	0
uh	1
and	1
and	0
like	0
minute	0
marks	0

um	0
basically	0
the	0
the	0
whole	0
well	0
no	0
i	0
guess	0
the	0
minute	0
marks	0
but	0
the	0
minute	1
marks	0
are	0
done	0
they're	0
like	0
hearts	1

oh	0

and	0
then	1
the	0
at	1
the	0
numbers	1
they	1
they're	1
kind	0
of	0
outlined	0
and	0
stuff	1
it	1
it	1
was	0
quite	0
bit	0
of	1
work	1
but	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
fun	1
too	0
i	0
really	0
like	0
doing	0
stuff	0
like	0
that	1
so	0

i	0
did	1
some	0
needlepoint	1
years	0
ago	1
and	0
then	1
i	0
got	0
into	0
the	0
bargello	1

oh	0
what's	0
that	0

well	0
it's	0
an	0
italian	1
um	0
needlework	1
using	1
using	1
the	0
uh	0
i	1
started	1
to	0
say	0
the	0
canvas	1
but	1
the	0
uh	0
hum	0
the	1
what	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0
cloth	0
uses	1
that	0
i	1
i've	0
just	0
gone	0
blank	1
but	0
it's	0
used	1
wi[th]	0
uh	0
with	0
yarn	1
and	1
it	1
usually	0
takes	1
long	1
stitches	0
over	0
two	1
or	0
three	0
openings	0
in	0
the	1
cloth	1

huh	0

and	1
you	0
weave	0
intricate	0
patterns	1
and	0
use	0
different	0
colors	1
like	1
it	0
could	0
be	1
a	0
flame	1
stitch	1
where	0
so	1
rather	0
than	1
drawing	0
a	0
picture	1
you're	0
making	1
a	1
design	1
like	0
a	1
geometric	1
or	1
whatever	1
and	1
it	0
was	0
used	0
quite	1
often	1
in	1
the	0
colonial	1
times	1
to	0
uh	0
uh	0
to	0
upholster	0
chairs	1
and	1
so	0
forth	1
as	0
well	0
as	0
the	1
crewel	1
um	0
embroidery	1
work	1
that	0
was	0
done	0
on	0
them	0

wow	0
well	0
that's	0
interesting	1
what	0
did	1
you	0
what	0
kind	1
of	0
things	0
did	0
you	0
do	0

what	1
i	1
did	0
when	1
when	0
i	0
was	1
doing	1
that	0
was	1
mostly	0
pillows	0
you	0
know	0
for	1
sofas	0
and	0
so	0
forth	0
and	1
i	1
can't	0
find	0
one	0
that	0
i've	1
done	1

oh	0

it's	0
one	0
of	0
those	0
things	1
i	0
didn't	1
i	0
didn't	0
give	0
them	0
away	1
but	0
i	0
didn't	0
know	0
if	0
it's	0
been	0
my	0
color	0
choice	1
or	0
multiple	0
moves	1
or	1
or	0
what	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
it	0
i	0
was	0
so	0
proud	1
of	0
them	0
when	0
i	0
got	0
them	0
finished	1
but	0
i	0
have	0
no	0
idea	0
where	0
they	0
are	1

what	0
did	0
you	0
call	0
that	0

bargello	0
it's	0
b	0
a	0
r	1
g	1
e	1
double	0
l	0
o	1

huh	0
that's	0
i've	0
never	0
heard	1
of	0
that	0
before	0
i've	0
probably	0
seen	1
it	0
though	0
i	0

i	0
suspect	0
you	0
i	0
suspect	0
you	0
have	0

i	0
mean	0
when	0
you	0
described	0
it	0

yeah	0
i	0
mean	1
when	0
you	1
described	1
it	0
it	0
sounded	1
like	0
something	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
would	0
be	1
around	1
i	0
guess	0
but	1
um	0
i've	1
never	0
heard	1
of	0
it	0
before	0
and	1
it's	0
really	0
interesting	0
um	0
i	0
guess	1
i've	0
decorated	0
baskets	1
and	0
stuff	0
before	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
but	0
i've	0
kind	0
of	0
gotten	0
out	0
of	0
that	1
i	0
use	0
to	0
do	0
a	0
lot	0
more	1
and	0
sell	1
at	0
craft	0
shows	0

me	0
too	0

really	0

yeah	0
that's	1
interesting	0

yeah	0
it	0
[laughter-is]	0

how	0
did	0
you	0
know	0
to	0
choose	0
this	0
subject	0
tonight	1
that's	0
funny	0
uh	0
uh	0
what	0
how	0
did	0
you	0
what	0
kinds	0
of	0
decorations	1
did	0
you	0
use	1
with	0
the	0
bas[kets]	1
how	0
were	0
you	0
decorating	0
the	0
baskets	1

oh	1
basically	0
bows	0
and	1
lace	0
uh	0
ribbons	0
um	0

um	0

um	0
i	1
really	0
wanted	0
to	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
so	0
many	0
of	1
them	0
now	1
have	0
the	1
ribbons	1
where	0
i'm	0
not	0
sure	0
how	0
they	0
do	1
it	0
but	0
the	0
ribbons	0
they	1
make	0
them	0
they	0
like	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
how	1
to	0
explain	0
it	0
they	0
make	0
them	0
hard	0
you	0
know	0

like	0
fabric	0
that's	0
been	0
stiffened	1
in	0

yeah	0

yes	0

i've	1
never	0
done	0
that	0
and	0
those	0
are	1
so	1
neat	1
i	0
mean	1
i	1
would	0
really	0
like	0
to	0
do	0
those	1
but	0
um	0

i've	0
seen	0
some	0
and	0
there	0
there	0
they	0
i	0
suspect	0
they're	0
fairly	0
simple	1
because	0
the	0
one	0
lady	0
i've	0
seen	1
i	0
know	0
that	0
does	1
it	0
i've	0
never	0
asked	0
her	0
any	0
questions	1
but	0
she	1
has	0
three	0
kids	0
all	1
under	0
the	0
age	0
of	0
like	0
six	1

and	1
and	0
they're	0
all	1
a	0
handful	1
so	0
it's	0
got	0
to	0
be	0
something	0
she	1
can	0
do	0
fairly	1
easily	0
and	0
fairly	1
quickly	0

oh	1
definitely	0
yeah	0

when	0
i	0
do	1
um	0
crochet	1
it's	0
it's	0
usually	1
the	0
the	0
lacy	1
victorian	1
type	0
things	0
like	0
that	1
and	0

oh	0

and	0
i	1
stiffen	0
those	1
with	0
a	0
a	0
glue	1
mixture	0
it's	0
like	0
white	1
glue	0
and	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
similar	0
to	0
that	1
that	0
the	0
fabric	0
is	0
dipped	1
in	0
and	0
then	1
um	0
allowed	0
to	0
dry	1
in	0
those	1
those	0
draping	0
bows	1
i	0
mean	0
those	0
draping	1
streamers	0
i	0
don't	0
know	0
i	0

oh	0

i	0
was	0
just	0
there's	0
bound	0
to	0
be	0
some	0
kind	0
of	0
fabric	1
stiffener	0
like	0
that	0
that's	0
very	0
similar	1
that's	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
melt	1
too	0
much	0
with	0
uh	0
uh	0
high	1
humidity	0
in	1
in	0
a	0
room	1

yeah	0

that's	1
i	0
think	0
that's	0
what	0
my	0
concern	1
was	0
you	0
know	0
wasn't	0
really	0
sure	1
and	0
how	1
they	0
would	0
how	0
they	0
would	0
last	1

do	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
my	0
concern	0
is	1
how	0
will	0
i	0
dust	0
this	0
thing	1

you're	0
[laughter-right]	0
no	0

i'm	0
[laughter-terrible]	0

no	0
that's	0
true	0
[laughter-though]	1
that's	0
funny	0

so	0
many	0
of	0
my	0
crafts	0
well	0
right	0
now	1
i'm	0
looking	0
at	0
a	0
little	0
uh	0
uh	0
quilted	1
uh	0
uh	0
hanging	1
it's	1
like	0
it's	0
a	0
flag	1
and	0
i	0
don't	0
want	1
to	0
wash	0
it	0
because	0
that	0
would	0
start	0
breaking	0
down	0
the	0
batting	1
and	0
so	0
forth	0
but	0
it's	0
such	0
a	0
dust	1
collector	0
to	0
be	0
out	1
and	0
so	0
forth	1
and	0

yeah	0

and	0
most	0
of	0
my	0
things	0
are	1
dust	0
collectors	1

uh	0
and	0
i	0
hate	0
to	0
dust	0

i	0
know	0

so	1
that's	0
the	0
first	0
thing	1
i	0
think	0
of	0
is	0
how	0
easy	0
would	0
this	0
thing	0
be	0
to	0
clean	1

that's	0
funny	0
no	0
i	0
just	0
um	0
i	0
don't	0
i	0
have	0
really	1
have	0
gotten	0
out	0
of	0
it	0
i	0
don't	0
do	0
it	0
quite	0
as	0
much	1
as	0
i	0
used	1
to	1
um	1
i	0
guess	1
because	0
i	0
i	0
went	0
back	0
to	0
school	1
so	0
i	0
don't	0
have	0
as	0
much	0
time	1

oh	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
time	1

now	0
and	0
i	1
have	0
two	0
children	1
[laughter-also]	0
[laughter-so]	0

you	0
definitely	1
don't	0
have	0
[laughter-time]	0

it	0
keeps	0
me	0
very	0
busy	0
but	0
i	0
really	0
enjoy	1
it	0
when	0
i	0
do	1
do	0
it	0
when	0
i	0
get	0
the	0
chance	1
you	0
know	0
it's	0
really	0
it's	0
so	0
relaxing	1
to	0
just	0
sit	1
and	0
but	0
once	0
i	0
get	0
started	0
i	0
can't	0
put	0
it	0
down	1
i	0
just	0

i	0
have	0
a	0
similar	1
problem	0
i've	0
got	0
to	0
have	0
time	1
or	0
i	0
don't	0
even	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
into	0
it	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	1

uh-huh	1
uh-huh	0

and	0
so	0
i	0
end	1
up	0
lots	0
of	0
time	0

total	1
almost	0
total	1
silence	0
i	0
can't	0
really	0
watch	1

[laughter-my]	0
[laughter-life]	1
